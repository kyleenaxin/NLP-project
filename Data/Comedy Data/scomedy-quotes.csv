Adam Carolla,,You shouldn't be eating anything that takes six minutes to microwave.
Adam Carolla,,If the rich are evil why are you sitting in their library? Why are you sitting in their hall? Why did I just listen to a whole show on orangutans with no commercials that they paid for?

Adam Carolla,"truth,honesty","The God's honest truth is that I'm probably funnier, but he's smarter. Here's the thing about Stern - he's really a smart guy. He's nutty. He's outrageous. He's all those things, but he's also a very smart guy."
Adam Carolla,,He has a great sense of humor - but it's in his assembly. It's really his craftsmanship that people overlook. It's not being fair to him just calling him outrageous.
Adam Carolla,,"Maybe it's weird, but I don't feel in any way, shape or form that I'm taking over his show."
Adam Carolla,,"If you are tuning in just for the show, you're going to be sorely disappointed."
Adam Carolla,television,"When you do television, there's more to do, and when you do new television, there's a lot more to do, especially when you don't have partner. I miss not having that person."
Adam Carolla,,"I'd be at someone's house or be up on the roof all day and I'd get lonely - stir crazy - and talk radio became this soothing voice in my life. But the idea that I was making $10 an hour and stacking drywall while these guys were making a few hundred thousand, and they were having a party, and there were Playmates and there were good times, I just couldn't imagine it."
Adam Carolla,,I got drunk in Canada. I was there for 2 days but I was drunk there for 4 days. I don't know how it worked. I guess it was with the time difference or something.
Adam Carolla,"cars,art","The Aston Martin is a beautiful car. It's a work of art, I love the interior and the style of the car."
Adam Carolla,,"Mmm, tastes like hepatitis!"
Adam Carolla,,"Figure out what to do, then take a nap."
Adam Carolla,,"If you're a guy, you have absolutely no idea what's going on at any time in the relationship, ever. Here's what you know: you know when you're getting laid, and you know when it's all over. Those are the only two things you're aware of."
Adam Carolla,,It's like the Fouth of July in my underpants.
Adam Carolla,,"All TV is, is really: ""Don't you want to be this, aren't you glad you're not that."" There's nothing really in the middle."

Adam Carolla,,"Spontaneous, clever, specific, oblique and at the same time very human."
Adam Carolla,sisters,"I spoke to my dad, and he said it took close to 90 dollars to raise me. But that was me and my sister, and my sister moved out when she was 16, so sometimes it can knock you up to triple digits to raise a kid."
Adam Carolla,,"My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of ""if you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your taxes, you should be able to just do what you want to do."" It's the freedom and the independence."
Adam Carolla,women,"Oprah tells women what to read, what to eat, what to think, what to do..."
Adam Carolla,audience,"There's no math equation that equals ratings or demographics or even takes into consideration ""The Man Show"". What the fuck is ""The Man Show"" audience? You either go up there and connect, or you go up there and you don't connect."
Adam Carolla,"care,dating","Everyone keeps saying, ""Oh my God, oh my God, how intimidating."" It's like saying, ""How could you date Jennifer Aniston after she's been with Brad Pitt?"" I don't care."
Adam Carolla,society,"I urge all our listeners to masturbate. Right now. Because it takes the wind right out of the sex drive. We don't want rapists going into society half-cocked and ready to go. If they masturbate, they'll say, ""Uhh... I think I'll rape tomorrow instead."""
Adam Carolla,"religion,atheism,agnosticism",I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don’t think there is no God; I know there’s no God. I know there’s no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there’s no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won’t admit it because there’s another thing they know. They know they’re going to die and it freaks them out. So most people don’t have the courage to admit there’s no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out.
Adam Carolla,,"When I am king, I will revise the sexual bases system so that getting to first base will include oral sex and sodomy!"
Adam Carolla,,"It should be like a salmon taking to open water. I've done so much morning radio that I won't be overwhelmed by it, but it's still going to be a challenge."
Adam Carolla,,"What happens is fucking say you can do the joke, but what they're going to do is take your beautiful broth and dump a pillowcase full of flour into it. Then, they say you can still have your broth, but it's not so good anymore, and ultimately it's the people who get the crappy soup because they're worried about the one guy who is allergic to it and not the rest of us."
Adam Carolla,"hate,asians,dancing,terrorists","This is why the terrorists hate us. And it’s not the glitter and it’s not the pomp and circumstance. We’ve got black and white, we’ve got Hispanic and Asian, we got gay, straight, and Guttenberg, all working together for one common goal: to get the mirror ball. And the mirror ball doesn’t care what color you are, and it doesn’t care how rich your parents are, and it doesn’t care what God you pray to. It’s an even wooden floor, and may the best man or woman win. And I say God bless Dancing with the Stars, and God bless the USA."
Adam Carolla,,"My son I worry about. I'm pretty sure he's gonna be gay. At this point I'm just hoping he's not a bottom. Sorry to sound closed-minded and uptight, but let's face it, no dad wants his son to be gay. Not only do you get no grandkids, but I'm sure high school is no picnic for a fifteen-year-old gay boy. On the other hand, maybe I'm just viewing this through the bifocals of an old heterosexual dude. The way things are going, my son will probably get his ass kicked for not being gay. ""Carolla thinks he's too good to suck cock. Come on boys, lets get him."""
Adam Carolla,,"I had two thoughts about it. One was I could do that, and the next one was I'll never get to do that."
Adam Ferrara,"importance,happiness","Ladies, your happiness is very important to us. You have to understand that. Because when you're happy, you let us touch you."
Adam Ferrara,men,"Men tend to lie when it comes to sexual conquests. You should hear some of the ego-driven lies my friends have told me: ""Swear to God, man - the hooker gave the money back."""
Adam Ferrara,,"I woke up my pop in the middle of the night 'cause the boogie man's under my bed. My pop is this big, huge man, nothing can hurt him. I went running into his bedroom like, ""Daddy, Daddy, the boogie man's under the bed!"" Pop opens one eye, he's like, ""Is the boogie man bigger than me?"" ""Well, no Daddy, he's not."" ""Well, you got your choice: you can deal with the boogie man or you can deal with me."""
Adam Ferrara,,"You were an altar boy, right? No wonder you're so angry. Show me on Kiefer Sutherland where the priest touched you."
Adam Ferrara,"religion,holidays","My favourite Catholic holiday is Easter. For those of you that don't know, Easter is the day we celebrate Jesus rising from the grave and coming back to Earth as a rabbit that hides coloured eggs."
Adam Ferrara,,"I sincerely want to meet the girl that was meant for me, but I want to sleep with the girls that weren't."
Adam Ferrara,,"Being in a relationship is like being in A.A. My friends ask me, ""How's it going with that girl?"" ""One day at a time, man."""
Adam Ferrara,rain,"If she gets a hot flash and walks into a cold room, she can make it rain."
Adam Ferrara,change,"The human body is in constant change the minute we're born. It's in a constant state of decay. We're all like Ford Escorts, just falling apart."
Adam Ferrara,,"I love that magazine, man - Victoria's Secret - and it comes, like, every three hours."
Adam Ferrara,,"I don't think it's fair - you get married, you give your wife a wedding ring. I think you should give her a mood ring. Oh, it may sound crass, but just check the color when you come home. ""Hi honey. Infernal red? Oh boy, I ain't getting laid, and I gotta cut the lawn, I know it."""
Adam Ferrara,,I think human arrogance will be the demise of civilization.
Adam Ferrara,,"What if God's a woman? Not only am I going to hell, I'll never know why!"
Adam Ferrara,girlfriends,The biggest thing in my life right now is my girlfriend. I love this girl. I know I love her because she told me.
Adam Ferrara,"differences,devil","There were many reasons we broke up. There was a religious difference: I'm a Catholic, and she's the devil."
Adam Ferrara,women,"I don't think I'll ever meet the perfect woman. I might have to get me one of them mail order women. You can do that: you send away to the Philippines, and they send you a wife. The only thing is, once you're on their mailing list, they keep sending you a relative a month whether you want it or not."
Adam Ferrara,,"Whenever she uses the phrase ""I was thinking...,"" that means I either have to move, paint or buy something."
Adam Ferrara,"girlfriends,love,sex,emotions","I love my girlfriend, don't get me wrong. I truly love this woman, but I have the ability to have sex without any emotional involvement. It's a gift."
Adam Ferrara,parents,"We're all products of our parents: all your mother's traits are in the egg and all your father's traits are in the sperm. And if I know my parents, that sperm and egg had a fight."
Adam Ferrara,soul,"As soon as you lay down, that's when the most bizarre things start coming out of her mouth. ""Goodnight, baby."" ""Do you think we were together in a past life?"" ""Yeah, and I died of sleep deprivation. Go to bed."" ""Don't you feel like we're soul..."""
Adam Ferrara,,"You gotta fight. You gotta get out the negative energy. Don't let it build up. You end up screaming at each other over something totally stupid, like, ""Well, why'd you put this spoon in this drawer then?"" Just to piss you off, that's why! I got spoons hidden all over this house! Keep it up, and your napkin rings are gonna start disappearing."
Adam Ferrara,,"If you look at a group of people that had faith, it's got to be the Jews. They followed Moses through the desert for 40 years with no map. There had to be one guy in the back, like, ""I don't think he knows where he's going."""
Adam Ferrara,questions,I love to believe that there's one god but there's many different religions so there's just the question of which long distance company you pick.
Adam Ferrara,,"One day in the shower, you figure it out. It's a special day in a man's life. I was like, ""Oh, I found me a hobby."""
Adam Ferrara,,"I talk a lot about women in my act, 'cause let's face it - if I was hungry, I would talk about food."
Adam Ferrara,girlfriends,My girlfriend wants to get married. I tell you - I hope she meets somebody nice.
Adam Ferrara,religion,"I am a Catholic. Basically, the Catholic religion is ""If it feels good - stop."""
Adam Ferrara,sex,"My father tried to give me the sex talk once, and he chickened out. He walked into my room and went, ""Adam - uh, don't kiss guys."""
Adam Ferrara,parents,"The only marriage I've observed for any length of time is my parents - 35 years. I asked my pop, I go, ""Pop, 35 years - what do you hope for?"" He's like, ""I hope you die first."""
Adam Ferrara,,"I know she's just trying to make things nice, so I do my part. Now, when I get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, I turn on the light. I used to just go by sonar: just keep peeing 'til you hear water."
Adam Ferrara,"friends,importance,sex",Sex is important to guys. We need stories to tell our friends.
Adam Ferrara,,"My fondest childhood memory is I made out with my babysitter, Cathy. She stops in the middle of everything: ""We have to stop this. I feel like such a whore."" ""Why? I'm not paying you - my parents are! Come here!"""
Adam Ferrara,"animals,dating","I look to nature because I think the animals are smarter than we are. Animals mate; humans date. There's no dating in the animal kingdom. No dinner, no movie - just a quick sniff, ""Alright, let's go."""
Adam Ferrara,hollywood,The girls are beautiful in Hollywood - and enough silicon to caulk a sink.
Adam Ferrara,"men,women",That's the perfect microcosm for men and women: it takes a million sperm to find one egg 'cause they're all males and not one of them is gonna pull over and ask directions.
Adam Sandler,,"Comedy, such a lovely lady, she'll pick you up, you your feeling blue."
Adam Sandler,,Now that's what I call high quality H2O.
Adam Sandler,,"I think the reason I don't read is because, when I'm reading, I feel like I'm missing out on something else. You know, What are my friends doing? Where's my girlfriend?"
Adam Sandler,,"They should name a gender after you. Looking at you doesn't do it, staring is the only way that makes sense. And trying not to blink so you don't miss anything. And all of that and you're you."
Adam Sandler,,"I'm 31 now. I think I'm beginning to understand what life is, what romance is, and what a relationship means."
Adam Sandler,,"I'm not looking to get away from anything. I like what I've done. I like what I get to do and I enjoy working with my friends. I loved those movies, but this is incredible."
Adam Sandler,,"I don't laugh at me. I used to. I used to get the giggles when I'd see myself. But now, I see myself onscreen, and I sure don't laugh."
Adam Sandler,,I can’t run a company… I can’t even run my own life!
Adam Sandler,,My comedy is different every time I do it. I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
Adam Sandler,,"I never had a speech from my father ""this is what you must do or shouldn't do"" but I just learned to be led by example. My father wasn't perfect."
Adam Sandler,,"It definitely has learning a lesson about the way you're living your life. I wouldn't compare our movie to that, but it has a structure where it's about a man who doesn't appreciate all that he has and finds out at the end that life has been great and he has to enjoy that."
Adam Sandler,,"So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink, put you to bed when you've had too much to drink."
Adam Sandler,,"I sing seriously to my mom on the phone. To put her to sleep, I have to sing ""Maria"" from West Side Story. When I hear her snoring, I hang up."
Adam Sandler,,"Mama says that, alligators are onry cause they got all them teeth, but no toothbrush..."
Adam Sandler,,I don't think about that. I wasn't a kid growing up saying one day I'll get an Oscar and make a speech. That wasn't on my mind. So what I do is the best work I can do.
Adam Sandler,,"I guess in my house when I was growing up, I was comfortable trying to be funny. And my dad, of course, it bugged him sometimes. He was trying to rest, and I was constantly trying to say something stupid to get a reaction. But I like doing these movies. You can do it in front of the camera and then it's over. I don't have to worry about being in front of too many people."

Adam Sandler,,Its too damn hot for a penguin to be just walkin’ around here.

Adam Sandler,golf,Golf requires goofy pants and a fat ass.
Adam Sandler,"girlfriends,acceptance","Doing Saturday Night Live definitely affects my relationship with my girlfriend and with my family, because you feel so much pressure to do well that night. But I think everyone's grown to accept that and so they give me my space at the show."
Adam Sandler,,"Feels good to try, but playing a father, I'm getting a little older. I see now that I'm taking it more serious and I do want that lifestyle."

Adam Sandler,,I shouldn't be near Vegas and have money in my pocket.
Adam Sandler,,Most of the stuff I do on the show comes out of me just trying to make my friends laugh.

Adam Sandler,florida,"I bought my parents some stuff. That feels kind of good to be able to do that. I got them a place in Florida. I think I'm allowed to say that - I hope my dad doesn't get mad at me. But I don't spend money on myself. I don't like myself enough yet. But the people I love, I like spending the cash on them."
Adam Sandler,"driving,ice cream","I'd like to have a kid, and I'd like to be driving around. I know a kid is going to be a big part of my life. I can trust my kid. I know my kid would be in the backseat of my car, and when I say ""You wanna get some ice-cream?"" he's going to be happy. My brother has kids. I see that trick work, the ice cream trick."
Adam Sandler,hollywood,"You know, when you don't go on TV and talk about how many women you sleep with, some people in Hollywood, that are supposedly ""in the know"", start whispering that you're gay. If I were gay, I wouldn't be ashamed to admit it, but I'm not."
Adam Sandler,hockey,"I’ve got a hockey record, I took off my skate and tried to stab a guy, I’m the only person who ever tried that."
Adam Sandler,,Stop looking at me swan.

Adam Sandler,sisters,"I sang a song at my sister's wedding. My mother forced me into that, too. But that one felt all right."

Adam Sandler,ice cream,Wasted is when you have a hankering for ice cream.
Adam Sandler,challenges,"Never seen my friends do more push-ups, trying to challenge Cruises' manhood. It was like, ""I can be strong, too!"""
Adam Sandler,,Now let's cut the stupid cake because I know the fat guy's gonna have a heart attack if we don't eat again soon. And while we do that here's a little mood music for you.
Adam Sandler,hollywood,"It's just weird that out of nowhere God said, ""May the three best-looking guys in Hollywood have babies - Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and me"". It was bizarre that God said, ""I want to make the planet more beautiful"", and I got the call."
Adam Sandler,,"I noticed you all were French, opposite of bonjour to you."
Adam Sandler,importance,"The problem with me, as far as getting married and having a family, is that my comedy is so important to me. So I don't know if I'll ever be as good a dad as my dad."
Adam Sandler,,This character feels so much like my brother. He has two children. He has a wife. He works with me. He chooses to stay in New Hampshire because he wants his kids to grow up in the school they started with. He doesn't want them to lose friends. He is his family's hero.
Adam Sandler,,"To be honest with you, when I got into this I never thought about reviews. I never thought about what people would say about me. I was just a young guy who was excited to become a comedian and an actor and I just wanted to get to do what I got to do."
Adam Sandler,,"We just bought this house. It's too big. It's like 400,000 square feet, or something. We got an indoor lake and ski slope in the house! It's just too big."

Adam Sandler,comedians,"When I was younger and did a stand-up gig, it would take me two weeks to recover. Sometimes I'd get so panicked that I would stutter."
Adam Sandler,,"I mean, I look at my dad. He was twenty when he started having a family, and he was always the coolest dad. He did everything for his kids, and he never made us feel like he was pressured. I know that it must be a great feeling to be a guy like that."
Adam Sandler,,"I drew the duck blue because I've never seen a blue duck before and, to be honest with you I wanted to see a blue duck."

Adam Sandler,friends,"My buddies, we've always just tried to make each other laugh. I mean, just like all friends hanging out - that's the goal."
Adam Sandler,dating,"First I asked her what time it is, right? Tomorrow I get to ask her the date, the day after that she's all over me. That's how it works, you play it slow."
Adam Sandler,,It's hard to soar with the eagles when you're surrounded by turkeys.

Adam Sandler,wife,Kid is healthy! Wife is healthy!
Adam Sandler,,He was great enough to be loose and funny about it.
Adam Sandler,,"That was so much easier, I should just get it in one every time."
Al Madrigal,wife,"If my wife has too much to drink at a party, starts yapping a little too much, I don't have to say anything... three little leg squeezes, she knows that means 'Put a sock in it, drunkie, time for you to wrap it up.' Somebody didn't have dinner like I suggested, now you're spouting off at the mouth divulging all the family secrets. You need to pipe down or we've got to fucking leave."
Al Madrigal,,"I'm half-Mexican - get used to it 'cause in about five to 10 years, you're all gonna be related to one. Whether you like it or not, no matter how much you prepared your family, you're gonna show up at Thanksgiving one of these years, you're gonna walk in and say, 'Hey! What's happening? Since when did we start serving flan?' Well, what's happening is that somebody's boning a Latino."
Al Madrigal,weed,"Don't bring your sand toys to the park. That's another bad move. Because I go to the park, and I'm on the Vicodin and a little weed too - let's face it - and I go in there, and my wife's like, 'Bring the sand toys! Bring the sand toys!' And I know what happens every single time: I become sand toy repo man from the eight little kids that run off in nine different directions with my sand toys."
Al Madrigal,beat,"That's what a pinata inspires. It's like, 'Hey kids, let's get your favorite cartoon character and let's lynch his ass. And then we're gonna all take turns beating the crap out of it until its guts come out. We can all scramble for its sugary entrails. Who's with me?!'"
Al Madrigal,,"I like bourbon, any other detail beyond that is going to make me seem like a drunk."
Al Madrigal,,"So I go back, reluctantly, down a murky hallway to what looks like a Dollar Store dressing room, and I open up the dirty curtain. There's a velvet Elvis on the wall with the eyes cut out - some weird sort of quality assurance program they're running in there. They got a dirty recliner they pulled off the street with duct tape on it - God knows what else. They got a bloody pipe on the floor. It's like a third world game of Clue."
Al Madrigal,mexicans,"What's happening is there's a warm front of Mexicans that are humping their way north to the point where you'll be up in Canada one of these years, walking around, you'll be like: 'Hey look, Eskimos! They came down.' Those aren't Eskimos - they're Meximos: Mexicans in parkas, trying to have sex with Canadian women."
Al Madrigal,,"I got distracted by one of the hippie moms who was breastfeeding a kid that was way too old to be breastfeeding. You ever seen that before? It's disgusting. A child should not be old enough to comment on the quality. Like, 'Do you go to Cheesecake Factory, because this is delicious. It's like dulce de leche meets Riesling coming out of this thing, and I've got to say thank you.'"
Al Madrigal,mexicans,"Then I get there and I swear - it's San Jose, CA - there's 2,000 Mexicans. And you know you're half-Mexican when you walk in and you're like, 'Damn. This is a lot of Mexicans. Only half of me is the only white guy here.'"
Al Madrigal,,I'm always alone. Sad face emoticon.
Al Madrigal,,"Well, once I fried tofu and put Sriracha on it. After that I was so depressed I swore off preparing food for myself altogether."
Al Madrigal,business,"You grow up real quick, a half-Mexican in a sailor's suit, because I'd be riding the streetcar to school everyday - minding my own business, humming out a 'Frere Jacques' - and I realized that in any other town, this might be considered cute. But you know what it is in San Francisco? Sexy."
Al Madrigal,,"I bullshit on the phone all day with a variety of people discussing various projects, and occasionally write jokes."
Al Madrigal,neighborhood,"Near my house in Los Angeles is a waterfall. I love to take the wife and kids, but it's also near a sketchy neighborhood. So there's a lot of gang members that hang out at the waterfall. It's like somebody took an Ansel Adams photo and then put a Cypress Hill video inside it."
Al Madrigal,"mexicans,business","We're down in Mexico. It's for a bachelor party, so we go into a Mexican strip club... I go back with this woman down a murky hallway, and then without missing a beat - these ladies are all business - she goes, 'Go ahead, take out your dong.' 'I'm not taking out my dong. And by the way, who uses the word ""dong""? If you want to be hip to the lingo, they're not using the word ""dong"" up in the States.'"
Al Madrigal,embarrassment,"My son comes out of his room wearing these flood pants with holes in both knees. I have no idea where he found these pants. And I go, 'Dude, you gotta change your pants. You can't wear those pants.' He goes, 'I like these pants, these are my favorite pants, I'm gonna wear them.' I didn't know what to say, I'm a young dad, so I go, 'You're gonna be embarrassed.' He looks at me, steps to me a little bit, and goes, 'I'm not gonna be embarrassed. They're your friends. You're gonna be embarrassed.' I was like, 'Son of a bitch.'"
Alan King,,"However, even under the best of circumstances, four-year graduation rates for the next few years will be substantially lower than those in the three provinces."
Alan King,honesty,"The best definition of an honest politician is one who… when he is bought, stays bought."
Alan King,love,"If you want to read about love and marriage, you've got to buy two separate books."
Alan King,,Modesty is not one of my virtues.
Alan King,decisions,"Once they make their commitment, they have to stay with that commitment, ... They have to live with that decision."

Alan King,,"If the banks are so friendly, how come they chain down the pens?"
Alan King,,It was nice to see Chocolate outriding the Flat jockey.
Alan King,rain,I think he has a hell of a chance on rain softened ground and he probably represents our best chance for a Festival victory.
Alan King,,"I was worried about the ground, and while I thought it was quicker than ideal, there was no jar."
Alan King,,"Jesus saves, Moses invests."
Alan King,food,"As life's pleasures go, food is second only to sex. Except for salami and eggs. Now that's better than sex, but only if the salami is thickly sliced."
Alan King,,Marriage is nature's way of keeping us from fighting with strangers.
Alan King,,"You do live longer with bran, but you spend the last fifteen years on the toilet."
Alan King,,"Banks have a new image. Now you have a friend, your friendly banker. If the banks are so friendly, how come they chain down the pens?"
Alan King,business,I don't think it's any secret. We can't continue to do business as we're currently doing it.
Alan King,society,"Comedy is a reflection. We create nothing. We set no styles, no standards. We're reflections. It'a a distorted mirror in the fun house. We watch society. As society behaves, then we have the ability to make fun of it."
Alan King,holidays,"A short summary of every Jewish holiday: ""They tried to kill us; we won; let’s eat!"""
Albert Brooks,art,Art and resistance are great together. That's what art's made for. Look at Vincent van Gogh: He didn't cut off his ear because he was selling well.
Albert Brooks,divorce,I'm not a person who I ever thought would do well with divorce. Not that it can't happen. I just didn't want that. So I waited a long time to meet the right person. Then I finally met someone that I was willing to be divorced from.
Albert Brooks,hollywood,"Being a screenwriter in Hollywood is like being a eunuch at an orgy. Worse, actually, at least the eunuch is allowed to watch."

Albert Brooks,,"I've never been disappointed, because I've never given somebody I liked that much power."
Albert Brooks,business,"I'd still like to see ""Survivor"" minus the planned show-biz parts. That would be the purest form of show business - I want to see someone so hungry that they eat somebody else's foot."
Albert Brooks,,"When I die, if the word ""thong"" appears in the first or second sentence of my obituary, I've screwed up."
Albert Brooks,"9/11,change","When we spoke, he told me, 'The Newsweek thing has changed the world.' And I said, 'Wasn't it 9/11 that changed the world?' But Michael said he just didn't want to take a chance."
Albert Brooks,"future,new york",I've seen the future! It's a bald-headed man from New York!
Albert Brooks,"rain,brain","I got so good at writing to a budget, my brain was restricting myself. I'd write, ""It's a stormy night."" Then I'd cross out stormy. I'd write: ""It's a calm night."" Then I'd cross out night. It's noon. Because you know how much night costs. You know how much rain costs. Nothing comes free in movies."
Albert Brooks,,I don't know that I can define fear. But one of the sources of fear is holding up some sort of model life that doesn't exist and feeling like you're far away from it.
Albert Brooks,change,The biggest waste of brainpower is to want to change something that's not changeable.

Albert Brooks,happiness,Had an unexplained burst of happiness today. Doctor said not to worry it will go away.
Albert Brooks,,The whole world is tense. Everybody gets the international news. There's been no American comedy at all that even remotely addresses the subject in any way. My goal isn't to solve the world's problems. My character wasn't even able to do his assignment. But the premise of wanting to find out about somebody - other than the stuff that the CIA will tell you - there's no hope unless we do that.
Albert Brooks,,Excited about Black Friday. Also excited about Jew Tuesday.
Albert Brooks,television,"I have children. I have a family to support. But I really could live in a one-room apartment, as long as the television worked. I never needed anything. Just a comfortable chair and I'm fine."
Albert Brooks,,I feel so badly about what they do to turkeys. That's why this year my family and I are eating a live bird.
Albert Brooks,"9/11,change","The world really changed after 9/11, not just in the tragic way, but in every way. So it took me a couple of years to even understand how my art form I could process any of this. When the world changed, eliciting laughter with subjects that were funny to me before 9/11 just didn't seem good enough."
Albert Brooks,,"There are a couple of images I really love in this movie. One is crossing into Pakistan illegally to see a group of guys who ordinarily you'd think would want to kill you, but they want to be stand-up comedians."
Albert Brooks,,"But I thought, what could I do in a teeny way - and believe me, it's a teeny way - to defuse this? There had to be some way to separate the 1.5 billion people who don't want to kill us from the 100,000 or so who do. I thought if I could get five Muslims and six Hindus and maybe 3 Jews to laugh for 90 minutes, then I've accomplished something."
Albert Brooks,,"This was enormously challenging, because it involved filling 120 blank pages with an actual story and words people say."
Albert Brooks,,"We export films that are full of sleazy jokes and toilet humor - that`s why we've earned the affectionate nickname of the Great Satan. What's seemingly benign, by our standards, is doing more damage to us around the world than anything I could ever do."

Albert Brooks,,Relaxation is the absence of worry.
Albert Brooks,,There's nothing funny about flying to Houston.
Albert Brooks,language,"Even if you didn't see the movie, you'd see two words you'd never seen put together before - comedy and Muslim. Comedy is friendly - it's the least offensive word in our language."
Albert Brooks,,"Bullfights are hugely popular because you can sit comfortably with a hot dog and possibly watch a man die. It won't be me, but I can sit comfortably and watch it."
Albert Brooks,,I don't want to get close to people who have secrets that I don't know about.
Albert Brooks,society,I've always felt like I work in a small little area that doesn't represent anything like the rest of society.
Albert Brooks,,"When they made 90210, there were people outside of Beverly Hills who went, Oooooh! But you don't go Oooooh! when you're in there. You're worried about passing the Spanish test."
Alonzo Bodden,,"I don't like conservatives. They always talk about the ""good old days"". I'm black, we have no ""good old days""."
Alonzo Bodden,,There are three goals for any comedian: to make a living as a comedian; I've been fortunate to do that. To make a name for yourself and to be famous would be great - because it would give me that freedom.
Alonzo Bodden,,"I was teaching airplane mechanics when I realized it was more fun to make them laugh. I was laid off one more time and I never looked back, although it was nice to have a steady paycheck and benefits."
Alonzo Bodden,,Every day theres something new. Something's going to destroy us all. Then it disappears.
Alonzo Bodden,,"Black people don't hijack planes, alright? Now I'll be the first to admit, we steal a lot of stuff, but we do not hijack planes. In fact, in the history of aviation, a black person has never even attempted to hijack a plane. Do you want to know why? Because you can't sell an airplane."
Alonzo Bodden,women,Scientists are trying to invent Viagra for women. It's been along for years... it's called cash.
Alonzo Bodden,differences,"The difference, generally speaking, between sportbike people and cruiser people is that sportbike people like performance skill and wear safety gear; cruisers like chrome, noise, and style. It's funny to me to separate them because I ride both. I prefer performance cruisers like the Honda Valkyrie I had or my Triumph Rocket III."
Alonzo Bodden,,I wish airplanes were more like elementary school with someone up front telling everyone to sit down and shut up.
Alonzo Bodden,divorce,Watching news showing all the same sex marriages. How long before first same sex divorce?
Alonzo Bodden,"homeless,vacation","This guy asked me to go camping on vacation. Camping - that's the dumbest vacation I ever heard of in my life. What, I'm gonna work all year so I can go out and pretend I'm homeless?"
Alonzo Bodden,asians,"I was on the highway - I saw the scariest thing in the world, man. I saw an Asian driving an SUV. Really, I just drove my car right into the guardrail, figured I'd save him some time."
Alonzo Bodden,,I could always make people laugh.
Alonzo Bodden,,"There's always something that's going to kill us all. A few years ago, tomatoes were going to kill us and a few years before that it was spinach. The FDA is run by a 7-year-old kid that hates vegetables!"
Alonzo Bodden,,"I got to be funny, I can't dunk."
Alonzo Bodden,driving,"I didn’t understand NASCAR until I met some NASCAR fans. You talk to a couple of NASCAR fans and you’ll see where a shiny car driving in a circle would fascinate them all day. I can make fun of NASCAR fans because if they chase me, I just turn right."
Alonzo Bodden,,"You know who's mad at Kobe? Every other player in the NBA. You know why? 'Cause he messed around on his wife and bought her a $4 million ring. Yeah, you know what that means: that's the new minimum. 'Cause you know how women are, man. Women get upset: 'Oh, really, what's this? A $1 million ring? What - did that bitch get my $3 million, too?'"
Alonzo Bodden,,"Latinos outnumber Black people now. I’m not too happy about it. Because it’s only a matter of time before we lose our month. Soon as they figure it out, they’re going to have Latino History Month. All we’re going to have is Cinco de Negro."
Alonzo Bodden,,"I like white women. That’s why I can’t hate white men. Because we need them for breeding. Sometimes I’m hanging with the brothers, and they get a little militant on me. They’re like, “Kill Whitey!” I’m like, “Slow down. Let’s think this through now.”"
Alonzo Bodden,,"I used to be an airplane mechanic until they started drug testing. That's when I knew it was time to let that one go. And people ask me about that; they're like, 'Is that true man? Did you really do drugs?' 'Yeah.' 'Why would you do drugs?' 'They work.'"
Alonzo Bodden,attitude,"You can't bring tweezers on an airplane. If I'm on a plane and you try to hijack it with tweezers, I'll whip your ass, man. You think I'm going to be late because you've got tweezers and a bad attitude?"
Alonzo Bodden,museums,"I’m a black male, over 40, with no kids, living in the suburbs - they wanted to put me in a museum. Why did I move to the suburbs? I started watching Desperate Housewives. If comedy didn’t work out I can always try gardening."
Alonzo Bodden,shoes,"We had one idiot put a bomb in a shoe, and now everybody's got to take their shoes off? Where's the bra bomber at? I say, if we've gotta wait in line, let's make it fun for everybody."
Alonzo Bodden,"honesty,work","I wasn't always a comic, I used to do honest work."
Alonzo Bodden,,"A joke is either funny or it's not funny. If I hear a funny joke, you know what I do? I laugh, that's what I do. I don't start a focus group to see who got hurt by the joke."
Alonzo Bodden,"men,gays","I work out with alot of gay guys at the gym. I do, because my only goal is to get into ""gay shape"". Now, you know what I'm talking about. Gay men are the most ripped kind of... listen... I don't know how strong you have to be to blow a guy, but I'm guessin', there is some muscle involved."
Alonzo Bodden,,"Comedy is the drug, when they laugh it's like I'm a jazz musician and they hear it, and they get it. It's power to take the crowd wherever I want them to go. I love it when they laugh, especially when they relate through laughter. It's a beautiful thing. It also means I'm going to get paid, which is nice."
Alonzo Bodden,,"I grew up in the suburbs. I’m an angry suburban nergo. I’m bad in, like, Starbucks. I’ll hurt you over a frappuccino."
Alonzo Bodden,,"In a relationship you have to communicate, which means listening to her talk. Ladies, you fake orgasms. We fake listening."
Alonzo Bodden,,"They sold me a duvet cover, and I don't have a duvet, I don't think. Then, they started treating me like I'm the idiot. They're like, 'Do you have a comforter?' 'Yeah.' 'Well, you have to protect it!' I had no idea it was under attack."
Alonzo Bodden,,"I like psycho chicks... Yeah, you hook up with a psycho, you're gonna learn something. First thing you learn is how to sleep with one eye open."
Alonzo Bodden,,Women like jewelry. They’re like racoons: show them some shiny stuff and they’ll follow you home.
Amy Schumer,,"My comedy is unapologetic and fearless. Like, sometimes you'll wind up having condomless sex with someone that you probably shouldn't. I'm interested in sharing that part of myself unapologetically so that other people will hopefully feel better."
Amy Schumer,,"I went home with this French guy 'cause he said something adorable, like, 'I have an apartment.'"
Amy Schumer,,"Now every idiot from high school's like, 'I'm back!' We weren't supposed to meet again. Stop poking me and inviting me to your weird vampire parties. No, I don't want to follow you on Twatter. Like, nobody's interested in you. I don't want to see you in real life, why would I want to follow you in the imaginary one?"
Amy Schumer,family,He was really into family... He'd never come on the road with me on the weekends 'cause he wanted to spend time with his wife.
Amy Schumer,,"We had to break up, though. We wanted different things - like he wanted kids and I wanted him to hear."
Amy Schumer,,I just say what I think is the funniest thing I could say. I'm not trying to make headlines. I'm just trying to say the stuff that I think is funny and will make people laugh.
Amy Schumer,,"I think you can go from being not very funny to working really hard for 10 years and figuring out how to make a living on the road, but I don't think you can rise much above that."
Amy Schumer,age,"It's a weird age. They're like, 'Amy, I'm pregnant.' And I still don't know whether to be like, 'Congratulations,' or 'Do you need a ride?'"
Amy Schumer,,No one’s ever cum on my face. That surprises a lot of people. Never caught one up top as they say in the biz.
Amy Schumer,,"The last couple of roles I missed out on went to Jennifer Hudson, Jessica Biel and Olivia Wilde."
Amy Schumer,,I donated blood today. That's what I call getting an AIDS test.
Amy Schumer,,"To be really great, you need to be naturally funny in order to stand out. But you can work at it, and find the best vehicle that you have to communicate what you're saying to people."
Amy Schumer,,"You know that show 'Teen Mom'? Or if you're from the South, 'Mom.'"
Amy Schumer,drugs,"It says, 'It's safest to let them sleep alone, especially if you drink, use drugs or are overweight.' Yeah, I thought that was weird, too. But if you think about it, if you're drunk, stoned or really fat, in the middle of the night, that baby might look delicious. I've eaten weirder things."
Amy Schumer,,My friends all got really into that show 'The Deadliest Catch.' But I never watched it 'cause I always just assumed it was about AIDS. It's about crabs. Don't tune in looking for that 'Big AIDS Hour.'
Amy Schumer,,"Nothing good ever happens in a blackout. I've never woken up and been like, 'What is this Pilates mat doing out?'"
Amy Schumer,,"I tend to eat pretty healthy, though, and I work out - I work out hard."
Amy Schumer,drugs,"The way that these girls keep themselves skinny is awful, isn't it? By vomiting or using hard drugs - which I can't afford."
Amy Schumer,,"I usually feel pretty good about myself. I know what I look like. You’d bang me, but you wouldn’t blog about it. You won’t be Twittering “You won’t believe who I’m inside.” It’s fine."
Amy Schumer,,"I may sound like a megalomaniac, but I feel like I'm equipped to become a great, memorable comedian, if I keep working my ass off and staying at the pace I'm at, and I feel a responsibility to do that because of the women who have done it before me, and the ones who need to do it after me."
Amy Schumer,,You shoot saltwater in your ass?
Amy Schumer,"homeless,accidents,shoes","I made out with a homeless guy by accident. I had no idea -- he was really tan, he had no shoes on. I just thought it was, like, his thang, you know? I was like, 'He's probably in a band.'"
Amy Schumer,love,"I'm so in love with my boyfriend right now. Everything is perfect, but we want totally different things in bed. Like, he's always turning the lights on, you know what I'm saying? And I shut them off, and he turns them on, and the other day, he's like, 'Amy, why are you so shy? You know, you have a beautiful body.' I was like, 'Oh my god, you're so cute. You think I don't want you to see me?'"
Amy Schumer,driving,"The girls I grew up with they're living normal, adult lives. So they call me now and they're like, 'Amy, I'm pregnant.' And I still react like, 'What are you going to do? I'll drive you, I guess.'"
Amy Schumer,,"I don't think that's a cute accent on dudes - the French accent. It makes my vagina shut like a steel trap. I mean, thank god for that other hole."
Amy Schumer,embarrassment,"You feel like such a dirty whore buying plan b. It is so embarrassing because it’s over the counter but you have to ask you pharmacist, and they know what you want but they make you ask. They’re lookin’ at me, I’m like, you see where my eyeliner is just give it to me."
Amy Schumer,,"I just went through a break up, actually. I'm not worried about meeting someone else or being lonely. I'm just worried about all the pictures. But my mom always told me, you know, ever since I was a little girl, 'Never put your face in them.'"
Amy Schumer,,"I was actually on two reality shows, which is crazy. Just to think that, out there, there was some guy, like flipping through the channels, being like, 'Hey, I 69'd her on a cruise ship.'"
Amy Schumer,,"My mom's always saying really smart things... like, you probably heard this one, 'Why buy the cow when the milk has HPV?' Wish I'd listened to that one."
Amy Schumer,,"I have an excuse, actually, why I've been drinking so much. I haven't said this out loud yet - this is exciting - I'm drinking for two. Thank you, wow. I mean, just for now. Somebody's being evicted."
Amy Schumer,,"I feel like you know what you're going to be good at when you're older based on what you like when you're younger. When I was younger my best friend was Tony, this kid Tony, and he loved rocks. He was always playing with rocks, counting them, and now he's a crack head."
Amy Schumer,,"It's work having a vagina. Guys don't think that its work but it is. You think it shows up like that to the event? It doesn't. Every night it's like getting it ready for its first Quinceanera, believe me."
Amy Schumer,,"My mom is very good at being passive-aggressive, and my Dad is a total wise-ass, so I think the mixture of the two of them is my comedy."
Amy Schumer,birthday,There's nothing more awkward than going to the first birthday party of a little girl when you told her mom to get rid of her - because the kid can tell.
Amy Schumer,parents,"You know what they say: 'Once you go black, your parents don't talk to you anymore.'"
Amy Schumer,,"I've always been really dark, and drawn to darker humor. Nothing has been forced, and I don't say anything for shock value."
Amy Schumer,,My background is in theater. I was a theater major in college.
Amy Schumer,,"Don't feel bad for me. I think I'm, like, so pretty."
Amy Schumer,,"I asked for a glass of Chardonnay. And in a 9/11-like twist, they didn't have any. They offered me Pinot."
Amy Schumer,,"You know what the worst part about my drinking is? When I'm drunk I slur. You know, like I say racial slurs. Wow, nobody likes that at a barbeque."
Amy Schumer,stuff,I like to create stuff. I like to express myself through jokes.
Amy Schumer,asians,"Out of nowhere she tells me that Oliver Stone - you know, the director - she's like, 'He has this huge Asian fetish, and I find it totally offensive.' And I'm like, 'Why, Kwan? That sounds awesome.' She's like, 'I'm offended because I'm Asian.' And I was just like, 'Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't even notice that. I thought you were just really tired.'"
Amy Schumer,masturbation,"I walked in on him masturbating. He's like, 'Are you mad?' I'm like, 'Uh no, but you seem to be. Holy shit. Does it owe you money?'"
Amy Schumer,,I'll never forget the day I realized I wasn't quite the Ford model I thought I was.
Amy Schumer,,There's a plastic bag whirling around in the wind. Is it a bag full of shit?
Amy Schumer,,"Very neat for a boy; always cleaned up his mess, no matter where he got it on me. He's Hispanic, so he's like, 'Now who's the wetback?' I'm like, 'Hey, still you. Get back in the kitchen, those dishes aren't going to do themselves.'"
Amy Schumer,,Want me to Stevie Wonder my way to the bathroom?
Amy Schumer,,"She's always bragging about the dumbest stuff. The other day she was telling me, she's like, 'You know I can still fit in my wedding dress.' I was like, 'Oh my god, who cares, right?' I mean it is weird that she's the same size now as she was when she was 8 months pregnant."
Amy Schumer,new york,"In New York I'm, like, a six - seven with all the padding. But in Miami, I was like a negative three. People were like, 'What the fuck is that?' Throwing up on their motorized wheelchairs. Children were crying. I was like, 'Beyonce calls it jelly.' They were like, 'That's cottage cheese, bitch. Do some lunges.'"
Amy Schumer,,"I feel very comfortable in my own skin. When someone makes jokes about me being heavy, it makes me mad. It's not true. I'm right where I should be."
Amy Schumer,honesty,"You have to pretend like you want to use a condom. I like to say something fun when I bring it up, but honest. I'll be like, 'You're going to want to wear this. I've had a busy month.'"
Amy Schumer,,"The kids didn't call me Amy Schumer; they called me Amy Jewmer. One summer, I'll never forget this, all the kids took turns throwing handfuls of pennies at me. I know, I was like, 'Excuse me - this is awesome!'"
Amy Schumer,school,I finally just slept with my high school crush. But I swear; now he expects me to go to his graduation - like I know where I'm going to be in three years.
Amy Schumer,,"It's work having a vagina. Guys don't think that its work but it is. You think it shows up like that to the event? It doesn't. Every night it's like getting it ready for its first Quinceanera, believe me."
Amy Schumer,"advertising,hate","I hate false advertising, like 'Skittles: taste the rainbow.' No one's ever been like, 'Rainbow, right you guys?' Or what's Reese's? 'There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.' Oh, really? Tell that to my uncle who used to put them in my underwear. Alright, maybe your uncles didn't love you."
Amy Schumer,,"I think of myself as a fairly attractive girl and always have, thanks to my mom. I was brought into this world thinking I was gorgeous because my mother was extremely devoted to this notion."
Amy Schumer,,"Hey! Just at the cemetery, thinkin' boutcha."
Andrew Dice Clay,,If it smells like fish its a dish. If it smells like cologne leave it alone.
Andrew Dice Clay,"men,money,dating","Don't most men actually think that the more money they spend on a date, the more fingers they get to stick in your pussy before they kiss you goodnight?"
Andrew Dice Clay,,People are taking the act too seriously. The Diceman character is a macho moron. It's juvenile comedy. I just like to make people laugh.
Andrew Dice Clay,,"Twinkle twinkle little star, Will she blow me in the car. I bought her dinner, she had fun. My balls are boiling, I'd like to come."
Andrew Dice Clay,sex,"Life is like sex, baby - the more you put in, the more you get out. End of story."
Andrew Dice Clay,,"C'mon baby, lose the bra."
Andrew Dice Clay,,Mother Goose? Yeah I fucked her.
Andrew Dice Clay,,Little Boy Blue - He needed the money.
Andrew Dice Clay,"gays,football","I think the best part of being gay is when you're done, you could turn over and talk about football."
Andrew Dice Clay,,What am I looking at? I want to eat you like a tossed fucking salad!
Andrew Dice Clay,care,"When you jerk off, you’re saying “Hey, I care about me.”"
Andrew Dice Clay,,"Jack and Jill went up the hill Both with a buck and a quarter, Jill came down with $2.50."
Andrew Dice Clay,pain,"I don't drink to get happy or to forget the pain. I drink to stop the voices in my head. Do you know what's so bad about them, they stutter. Ddddave... Kkkikikill your papapaparents!"
Andrew Dice Clay,"husband,girlfriends","I'm not the greatest husband - I've got a girlfriend. It doesn't really please my wife, but then if I was looking to please her I wouldn't have a girlfriend. I mean she knows about it, and I guess she's okay with it. Plus my kids like both of them."
Andrew Dice Clay,,"I like a bush. A nice big, hairy, stinky, smelly fucking bush. And I hate when they put cologne on it. They dummy it up with cologne like you don’t know where you are. I like that nice natural scent of salmon."
Andrew Dice Clay,girlfriends,"If my girlfriend brings home a nice looking friend of hers, I fuck her on principal. You know what I mean? Don't throw another bush in front of my face. What do you think I'm gonna do? Talk to it? I'm gonna bang it."
Andy Kaufman,television,"While all the other kids were out playing ball and stuff, I used to stay in my room and imagine that there was a camera in the wall. And I used to really believe that I was putting on a television show and that it was going out to somewhere in the world."
Andy Kaufman,,I was just teasing in fun...
Andy Kaufman,,"When you go through a tunnel - you're going on a train - you go through a tunnel, the tunnel is dark, but you're still going forward. Just remember that. But if you're not going to get up on stage for one night because you're discouraged or something, then the train is going to stop. Everytime you get up on stage, if it's a long tunnel, it's going to take a lot of times of going on stage before things get bright again. You keep going on stage, you go forward. Every night you go on stage."
Andy Kaufman,,We're hoping that this will also be the key to starting community events in a place where the whole community can come together. We've been working with the town on the total renovation.
Andy Kaufman,,"That was part of the whole original concept. We were thinking, it's off-season, let's do a really fun, local-oriented event, raise money for good causes and bring some music to the valley."
Andy Kaufman,audience,"When I perform, it's very personal. I'm sharing things I like, inviting the audience into my room."
Andy Kaufman,age,"My mother sent me to psychiatrists since the age of four because she didn't think little boys should be sad. When my brother was born, I stared out the window for days. Can you imagine that?"
Andy Kaufman,,I never told a joke in my life.
Andy Kaufman,,There's no way to describe what I do. It's just me.
Andy Kaufman,business,"I try to please people, to give them a good time, but I refuse to make my act conform to traditional show-biz standards of entertainment. There's a little voice that says, 'Oh, no, you can't do that, that's breaking all the rules.' That's the voice of show business. Then this other little voice says, 'Try it.' And most of the time, when the voice comes on and says, 'No,' that's the time it works."
Andy Kaufman,"criticism,satire","The critics try to intellectualize my materiel. There's no satire involved. Satire is a concept that can only be understood by adults. My stuff is straight, for people of all ages."
Andy Kaufman,wrestling,There's no drama like wrestling.
Andy Kaufman,,Pure entertainment is not an egotistical lady singing boring songs onstage for two hours and people in tuxes clapping whether they like it or not. It's the real performers on the street who can hold people's attention and keep them from walking away.
Andy Kaufman,"wrestling,audience","Whenever I play a role, whether it's good or bad, an evil person or nice person, I believe in being a purist and going all the way with the role. If I'm going to be a villainous wrestler, I believe in going all the way with it and not breaking character and not giving away to the audience that I'm playing a role. I believe in playing it straight to the hilt."
Andy Kaufman,,"I just want real reactions. I want people to laugh from the gut, be sad from the gut, or get angry from the gut."
Andy Kaufman,wrestling,"If I play my cards right, I could bring network wrestling back to TV. Unfortunately, to most people, wrestling is a laughingstock. But fortunately, I'm reaching people who otherwise wouldn't watch it."
Andy Kaufman,people,"What's real? What's not? That's what I do in my act, test how other people deal with reality."
Andy Kaufman,comedians,"I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. I don't even watch comedians. The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him. I've never done that in my life. My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can. I can manipulate people's reactions. There are different kinds of laughter. Gut laughter is where you don't have a choice, you've got to laugh. Gut laughter doesn't come from the intellect. And it's much harder for me to evoke now, because I'm known. They say, ""Oh wow, Andy Kaufman, he's a really funny guy."" But I'm not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads."

And I said, ‘You don’t look Jewish’. And she said, ‘Listen, asshole, There are certain lines you’re not supposed to cross, certain boundaries you’re never supposed to push’.

Anthony Jeselnik,,"Like I’ll never forget the last time, we played that game, she was like Anthony. If you could have lunch with anyone in the world living or dead who would it be. And I said I don’t know, Caligula and she was really Caligula, that’s your answer, that’s what you’re going to say to me your girlfriend: are you sure, I said I am sorry baby, let me change that, I’d have lunch with you and you’d be dead."

So finally, this year for his birthday, the whole family chipped in - and we put him in a home."
Aries Spears,"money,people","I’m at a very frustrating point in my career because I’m not a millionaire. Like, people assume because you’re in movies or TV, you’re rich. I’m not rich, but I’m far from broke. I’m what you call a ‘thousandaire.’"
Aries Spears,,"That's where the money is, on the road."
Aries Spears,white people,"I know when the anthrax thing hit - white people, y'all was very nervous. Y'all would come up to me at work and warn me, like 'Oh my God, Aries, be careful. Don't open your mail.' Let me tell you something - black folks was never worried about anthrax because, half the time, we don't open our mail no way. We might think that's a bill. We might hold it to the light and go, 'That's a red slip.' If you want to get us with anthrax, put that in a Jay-Z CD. That's how you get us."

Aries Spears,,I think Chappelle set the bar when he came out with his show. To be as great as him or greater you have to push it a little further - as long as there's substance in terms of the material.
Aries Spears,,"I always said if I ever get married, I would tell my woman - I love Michael Jordan, I am a Michael Jordan fanatic - I said, 'Michael Jordan is the only athlete you can sleep with and I wouldn't get mad, as long as you got something signed.

Aries Spears,,"Ladies Commit, There’s A Wedding In It For You."
Aries Spears,coffee,"I like to go to the frat house and drink with my white friends, because anytime you go drinking at the frat house, white boys bring you a drink and hand it to you like it's a top CIA secret. They'll hand me my drink, and I'll go, 'Man, what the hell is in this?' 'Dude, don't worry. Don't ask, just drink it. I'll see you in 20 minutes.' Next thing you know, I'm buck naked, standing on a coffee table, with a cowboy hat."
Aries Spears,,"Fellas, you have to stop letting women put all this pressure on us. Talking about, ""I didn’t come"". ""Bitch, I did. What’s wrong with your shit?""

Aries Spears,"white people,obama,coffee","Obama had all the right ingredients that came together at the right time. He’s tall, good-looking, articulate, highly intelligent, smooth under pressure, charismatic. And most importantly, the right shade. He made white people feel comfortable. Because y’all know if that nigga was Bernie Mac black or precious purple, he wouldn’t have won. He’s like coffee with cream, it goes down easy."
Arj Barker,,"I could've enjoyed a cigarette if I smoked back before everyone knew it was bad - say, like, 1923. Everybody smoked back then. There was no medical information against it; they had no idea - it was a paradise. It was a smoker's paradise: 'They're taking my lung out next week. I don't know why. Doctor thinks maybe I'm brushing my teeth too often, but I can't help it because, for some reason, my breath smells like I licked a monkey's ass.'"
Arj Barker,chicago,"I was in a real conservative area just outside of Chicago recently. And this guy's like, 'Hey, Arj, you're from San Francisco. Are you in favor of gay marriage?' I was like, 'Well, I'd like to get to know you a little bit better first. I don't know what ever happened to buying a guy a smoothie and seeing what happens. That's how we do it back home.'"
Arj Barker,,"Nobody can ever learn our military's secrets - unless, you know, they happen to have the Discovery Channel. Then, it's pretty easy, just tune in for a few minutes."
Arj Barker,shoes,"Can you imagine if you had a pair of shoes that you could only walk in? That could be kind of limiting under certain circumstances. 'Everybody get outta here! There's a swarm of bees coming!' What? Oh great, I got my walking shoes on today. I guess I better stroll the hell out of here at a moderate pace."
Arj Barker,,"For years and years, Arj Barker was high on life, but eventually, I built up a tolerance."

Arj Barker,,"I'm thinking of switching banks, and my friend said, 'Well, what's wrong with Citibank?' Well, they can't spell 'city.' I hope their math is better than their English is."
Arj Barker,cars,"I just got a car, and I gotta say, this car is very cryptic. The very first day I drove it, a light came on out of nowhere: 'Check engine.' Could they be any more vague? What if a light came on and said, 'Problem'?"
Arj Barker,,"She picked me up in her car because I was traveling by bus, and I thought it would be a lot easier for her to pick me up in her car than for me to convince Greyhound to reroute the bus to go by her house. The paperwork alone - logistical nightmare."
Arj Barker,"smoking,questions,museums,shoes",I was troubled by the presence of a shoe museum because it forced me to ask a very burning question: would my body be able to physically survive the amount of dope I would need to smoke in order to visit a shoeseum?
Arj Barker,"death,soul","I'm coming back. And when I get back, then we'll be together forever - forever and ever and ever - until death. Even beyond - beyond death: two souls enmesh as one soul! One soul floating for all of eternity in the great abyss, the aftermath, that which remains unknown to all who dwell in the trappings of mortal flesh, until the final passing!' Anyway, that's what I left on her answering machine. She hasn't called back yet."
Arj Barker,advertising,"All I knew about Ireland before I went there was what I learned from watching soap commercials all my life. I was totally misinformed. I thought it was an Irish tradition where you don't even take a shower with your soap - you take your soap for a walk, you compliment the soap for a little while and then, suddenly, you just start hacking it up with a hunting knife. "
Arj Barker,shoes,"There are so many types of shoes. There's so many categories, and I really have no idea what type of shoe I need at any given time. And I go in there - I find it a little bit overwhelming. 'Welcome to the shoe store! What are you looking for? Are you looking for walking shoes?' Well, uh, I'd like to have that option. Hopefully, they're adjustable. I mean, I'd like to be able to turn them up to other settings, as well."
Arj Barker,,"You don't just get a computer to get online. You gotta get other stuff. You better get a modem, or you're not getting on anything. You gotta get a monitor, that's what I found out. You gotta get a mouse. You gotta get a mouse pad. You gotta get a sperm guard for your keyboard."
Arj Barker,smoking,"You know the little camel on the pack of cigarettes? They just found out that's not even a camel. It's actually a horse with a big, old tumor growing out of its mouth."
Arj Barker,,"I never thought I'd be a comedian. But, growing up, I simply loved watching comedy. The '80s was huge for comedy in the US. Eddie Murphy blew me away with his film Delirious."
Arj Barker,,My friend and I were up to all sorts of shenanigans at school. But one time it ended up disrupting the whole class and we got in trouble. His parents told him he wasn't allowed to hang out with me any more. I had a friendship break-up in third grade. It was brutal.
Arj Barker,"gays,acceptance","Just open your heart man and accept that people are gay. Thousands, probably millions of people are gay. And until we find a cure - we will practice unconditional love and tolerance towards these people. And we will let them get married because they're easier to track that way."
Arj Barker,,There’s too much porn on the internet. That’s why I’m downloading all of it.
Arj Barker,,"I found a grey hair in my beard the other day, and that can mean one of two things. I'm either getting old or I'm a fucking wizard!"
Arj Barker,dating,"My friends, they only want to know one thing: 'Did you score? Did you score? Did you score? Did you score?' Hey, guess what - news flash, guys - a date's not a sporting event. A date's an opportunity to be in the presence of another individual and celebrate the unique-osity of that person. And no - I didn't fucking score!"
Arj Barker,"dating,flowers",She said I was moving too fast... I think it was a nice gesture to give her flowers on the first date. Perhaps the 'Bless This Family' plaque could have waited.
Arj Barker,"cars,driving","I never smoke grass and drive my car because, for one thing, no matter how many letters I write to the road commissions, they still refuse to start designing highways with second-chance exits."
Arj Barker,,Home is wherever I am. People make too big a deal about where you live. I try to be grounded in myself. Home is another way of saying 'a place where you keep all your stuff'.
Arj Barker,smoking,"I quit because I'm so tired of hearing bad news about cigarettes... Even if they discover good news, they don't publicize it - like the fact that smoking seriously reduces the risk of jogging."

Arj Barker,,I read this on the Internet - did you know that 4th of July is more popular in this country than in any other country in the whole world?
Arj Barker,hate,I hate all generalisations.
Arj Barker,,"I was a typical kid. I dug holes in the yard, threw rocks, had plum battles with the neighbours and used trash can lids as shields. I was always outside getting dirty."
Arj Barker,,"From an early age, I was trying to get laughs, but it wasn't a conscious thing. I think I was about six months old when I first realized I needed friends in life and making people laugh worked for me. By nine months, I came out of my shell."
Arj Barker,,I deserve someone who likes me for who I am pretending to be.
Arj Barker,,"Anybody see 'Cop Land'? I went to go see it, but I got stoned in the parking lot. And then on the way in, I read the marquee, and I got paranoid and went home."
Arj Barker,,"There's no razor in candy. If for no other reason, it doesn't make financial sense. It's not fiscally prudent. How much does a piece of candy cost - like, a penny and a half? An apple's like 15 cents? Anybody here bought a Mach 3 replacement cartridge recently? They're so expensive, they don't even keep them on the shelf. You know, you have to ask the people behind the counter. I feel like I'm trying to buy enriched plutonium or something."
Arj Barker,attitude,"Google is ridiculous. Everyone uses Google, and that's why Google has such an attitude. Because it's so popular, it's conceited. I mean, it has a serious attitude. Have you tried misspelling something lately? See the tone that it takes? 'Um, did you mean...?'"
Arj Barker,,"You're finally old enough to go trick or treating by yourself, and then they gotta give you that talk. 'Alright, son, just go door to door and get the candy, that's all you gotta do. Just go get the candy. Knock on the door, go to the next house, get more candy, and it's all yours. Get to keep it all. Have fun, get lots of candy. Oh yeah, one more thing I forgot to tell you, son - be careful 'cause the candy might have razor blades in it.' Oh my God, what a horrible thing to tell an 18-year-old..."
Arj Barker,animals,"I know that most domesticated animals aren't indigenous to this country. So guess what, cat? You can beat it. Go back to Catalina Island or Catalonia, Spain, or Katmandu, or wherever the hell your hairy ass is from! 'Cause this is America and around here - Katmandon't."
Arj Barker,philosophy,"I'm in love with a philosophy major, and she doesn't even know I exist. And what's worse, she can prove it."
Arj Barker,,I just got a new iPod. It’s got 80 gigabytes. Because I like to jog for three weeks at a time and I do not want to hear the same song twice.
Arj Barker,marijuana,"The last time I smoked pot and drove a car I ended up getting pulled over by a street cleaner. Marijuana has been scientifically proven to distort one’s perception of depth and distance. So driving’s a terrible idea. 'Cuz you’re in your car, like, ""Oh man, I got a small steering wheel. Well, I am a magical gnome.. so that’s pretty cool."" ""Maybe I’ll pull over by that pine tree and take a hike... oh wait, shit, that’s the air freshener!"""
Arj Barker,"dreams,halloween","I couldn't get away with Halloween pranks 'cause my parents owned the health food store. So, it was so easy to bust me. I was the only kid on the block egging houses with those big 'ole brown eggs. Like, you didn't have to be a detective to figure it out. 'Oh, I wonder who Tofuttied my mailbox. Is it the same evil genius who filled my bird bath with Rice Dream?'"
Arj Barker,tea,"My general rule of thumb is, once something's a ride at Disneyland, I assume that it is no longer a threat in real life. Which is why I don't expect to get attacked by a giant tea cup anytime soon."
Arj Barker,dating,"I believe that if you go on a date and get to second base and then you go home alone and rub one out, that’s like runs batted in."
Arj Barker,friends,"It’s gotten to the point where I think my friends would rather hang out with their own kids than hang out with me. And I’m like, ""Alright, but where’s the loyalty, man. I’ve known you for twenty-five years. How long have you known your baby, like, a month?"""
Arj Barker,,I fainted last night! Luckily I was going to bed at the time so I didn't get hurt.
Arj Barker,,"The other day I saw a guy with a sign that said, ""where will you spend eternity?"". Which freaked me out because I was on my way to the Department of Motor Vehicles."
Arj Barker,,"You can get tested now for early onset Alzheimer's. Hold on a second, could someone hire a marching band, cause I'm so happy I feel like having a parade. You mean I can find out early if I'm going to die of a super horrible disease that there's no cure for? Well, whoopee!"
Arj Barker,"ice cream,new york","I love New York, though I'll never eat any of the ice creams that they sell in the park. That's just disgusting. You see the little picture of them? They all have a little bite taken out of them already."
Arj Barker,decisions,"I’m trying to feel terrified and alone. And regret every decision I’ve ever made, drenched in a cold sweat. It’s called going to sleep. Maybe you’ve heard of it."
Arj Barker,"tennis,coffee","I had to buy a new printer the other day. The printer I wanted was like $200, but for some reason, I figured out that if I bought a printer/copier/scanner/faxer/coffee maker/clay oven/tennis racquet restringer, it's like $8.95. And I had to ask myself: why would it be that by paying less, I get more? How is it that the less I pay, the more I get? And I've figured out there's only one logical answer - the giant, multinational, megacorporations really just want me to be happy. That's the only possible answer."
Arj Barker,"comedians,wife,business","I’m not even worried about settling down. I think it’s way too early. I’m 25 and I’m in show business. I mean, if things go well, my wife hasn’t even been born yet."
Arj Barker,problems,"Now I have a fax machine. I never had one before, and I might have to admit, I'm excited to use it. But the problem is, I don't really have anything to fax. I mean, take a good look at me. Do I look like I have any documents that need to be somewhere in a hurry?"
Arj Barker,,I think its time to go to a library and face the facts.
Arj Barker,,"It’s too difficult to convey tone in electronic communication. And we can solve this my friends. All we need is some new fonts. ""'Great party Arj. Best party ever.' What a jerk!"" ""How do you know he wasn’t being sincere, Arj?"" ""Because he wrote it in Sarcastica! If he had enjoyed himself, he would have used Good Times Roman."""
Arj Barker,restaurants,"They got a restaurant called Hungry Jack's, but I didn't feel comfortable eating there. How good could it be? The guy who owns the restaurant is hungry. If it was called Fat Happy Fucking Well-Contented Jack's, I'd eat there. But I wouldn't bring a kid because it has a swear word in the title, and that's inappropriate."
Artie Lange,age,By the time I am Howard's age I hope to be long retired. I don't plan on working that long.

Artie Lange,,You're so stupid... Yet your live.
Artie Lange,gays,"I have gay friends, I support gay rights, I have nothing against the gay community, but when I see two guys kissing, I think it's gross. And, by the way, it's gross when 99% of straight people do it, too."
Artie Lange,,"Everytime I go to Vegas, I seem to incur some kind of fine."
Artie Lange,,"The Howard Stern Show is a big hit because it entertains dumb and smart people at the same time for different reasons. There's a couple of shows like that, The Simpsons is another one, smart people and stupid people love The Simpsons for totally different reasons; that's why it's a big hit, everybody's either smart or stupid so a lot of people watch it. Our show, smart people and stupid people love it for different reasons and early on in my career I made a commitment to myself; I refuse to cater to stupid people. What we do on the air is just try to be funny and hope that the smart people listen more than the dumb people."
Artie Lange,,"I wish I was this dark genius artist - like Richard Pryor or something. There's that story about how Eric Clapton saw Jimi Hendrix play, and he supposedly went home and cried because he could never be that good. I would never do anything that fruity, but I can relate to that. I wish I was as great as other guys, and that sucks. So I get the blues, and I self-medicate."
Artie Lange,,Well I have a drug history and a public drinking problem and I am not the healthiest guy. So they just ran that I died of a drug overdose.
Artie Lange,cocaine,"I had a career before the Stern show, on Mad TV. I was on the first two seasons of that and I got kicked off it because of possession of cocaine."
Artie Lange,,"If you are a black woman, you get two history months in a row."
Artie Lange,,But I live an interesting life and I can tell a pretty good story and it has helped my career. But the downside is people know everything.
Artie Lange,"drugs,cocaine","I did drugs wrong. I’m the only guy who ever got fat on cocaine. I went to rehab for coke, and a black guy came up to me and said, ""Damn, man, what are you pouring that shit on, cheeseburgers?"""
Artie Lange,,"A-Rod wants to be like Babe Ruth. And people don’t realize this, he’s a lot like Babe Ruth. Before the playoffs a couple of years ago, A-Rod went to the hospital and promised a dying kid he’d ground out to second for him."
Artie Lange,swimming,"I've never been swimming, and that's because it's never been more than half an hour since I last ate."
Artie Lange,,"For a degenerate like me, Vegas is like a walk down memory lane. Last time I went to Vegas, I went to my old coke dealer’s kid’s bar mitzvah."
Artie Lange,dating,"I was in five movies that got a total of four stars from The Daily News. And the reviews of ""Beer League"" were nothing compared to ""Dirty Work."" The review in my home town paper, The Star Ledger, said that I ""had all the charm of a date rapist."" I felt really bad about that, then Norm MacDonald; he's trying to cheer me up, being totally serious; says ""well, a date rapist has to have way more charm than a regular rapist!"""
Artie Lange,,"Women will do anything Oprah Winfrey says, and that is why we can't have women voting."

Artie Lange,happiness,"Vegas means comedy, tragedy, happiness and sadness all at the same time."
Artie Lange,business,Of course in show business there are two ways to play it and I am not politically correct so I am not going to get endorsements or anything like that.
Artie Lange,,"If Mike Tyson was the voice of your GPS, would you ever not use it?"
Artie Lange,"birthday,hollywood","In Hollywood, there is another name for a woman's 40th birthday party, it's a retirement party."
Artie Lange,,"My mother would say, before I left the house, 'Remember Art, hugs are better than drugs.' And I believed my mother, I believed everything she said - until the first time I got high at a party. I leaned back, and I went, 'God, this is way better than when my Uncle Perry hugs me. What else has my mother been lying to me about?'"
Artie Lange,,I'm 30 sit-ups away from the body of a young Mark Hamill.
Artie Lange,truth,Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.
Artie Lange,,"Howard's unbelievably nutty, politically incorrect style is probably the single biggest influence on me."
Artie Lange,business,"I had a job that people in this business would absolutely kill for on the sitcom I was on, I was working with one of my best friends. Laurie Metcalf was in the cast, really talented people on the Warner Brothers lot in LA. I was a supporting character making 35 grand a week, some weeks I'd have two lines. I had a job making 35 grand a week where I didn't have to take anything to work; I didn't have a briefcase or a piece of paper. I had ridiculously lame, easy jokes to memorize; like the jokes on that show would be I'd go to Norm MacDonald and say 'Are you thinking what I'm thinking?' and he'd say 'No, I'm not thinking of cheeseburgers,' then I'd make a face like 'oh, you got me' and then I'd walk out and then I'd get 35 grand on a Friday. So I had a convertible Mercedes, I was living in a four-thousand dollar a month condo on Willshire and Beverly Hills, I was healthy, I was thin, I had a tan. Even with that life, creatively I was empty inside, I couldn't stand it, after two years I had to get out of there, I was going crazy pulling the hairs out of my head."
Artie Lange,accidents,"I snorted heroin once by accident. It was amazing. But kids, don't snort heroin. It's too good."
Artie Lange,,"When I black out, it's the happiest time of my life."
Artie Lange,criticism,"I have been in a lot of movies, but none of them are critics' darlings, you might say."
Artie Lange,"drugs,hate","Don't do drugs to be cool, do 'em because you hate yourself."
Artie Lange,,I am not the easiest guy to live with. It is probably the lack of stability in my life.

Artie Lange,,"It's a life of five-card draw, and you know what? When God asked me - I'm fine with the card I got. I'm gonna play this."
Artie Lange,alcohol,The point of drinking in moderation is that sometimes you don't drink in moderation.
Artie Lange,,Whiskey will always be a part of my life.
Artie Lange,,"I once dealt with a prima donna on a movie set. I won't say who, but his first name is a country. A communist country. Run by Fidel Castro."
Artie Lange,,"When I got on Stern I realized that this was the one job where you could be really honest and open, almost like Richard Pryor or something. You can be honest about your life and get laughs."

Artie Lange,,"Jason Alexander is a committed actor, he went from working on a show about nothing to actually doing nothing."
Artie Lange,"new york,celebrities","I've let chicks think I'm another celebrity just to get laid, just to get any sex. I wish I had a dime for every time in the '90s a chick left New York City thinking she fucked Newman from ""Seinfeld""."
Artie Lange,"problems,business",I have a bad gambling problem. You're not in show business for 12 years and dress like this without a bad gambling problem.
Artie Lange,,"I'm not going to lie to you fellas, I've been drinking."
Artie Lange,,The only reason I can't recommend heroin to kids is because the effects wear off.
Artie Lange,,"And now it looks like I'm probably going to shoot a movie that I wrote. I got the money to do it, and I would star and all, because of being on Howard."
Artie Lange,,"You know how screwed up censorship is, two girls just agreed to make out naked in front of their fathers, and we went ""wait, don't curse""."
Artie Lange,,"I quit drinking, and I figure if I go to ten Yankee games this year without drinking I'll save $32,000."
Artie Lange,new york,"When I was a kid, I was into The New York Jets. And then I got into girls as I got older, and then I got back into the Jets because I'd realized there's times when the girl won't fuck you, but the Jets will always fuck you."
Artie Lange,,"It is funny because the guy who is my boss now, Howard Stern, has a similarity there. He got big being a regular guy. He wasn't the greatest looking guy in the world."
Aziz Ansari,,"No, I don’t text her, ""It was nice meeting you"". I wait eight weeks and I text her, ""What’s cracking?"""
Aziz Ansari,language,"The four sweetest words in the English language - ""You wore me down""."
Aziz Ansari,wife,"Yes, I’m married. But my wife understands that a good politician has to be appealing to the ladies. The fact that I haven’t even gotten close to cheating on her is a disappointment to us both."
Aziz Ansari,"danger,dating,restaurants","My perfect date night: I pick you up. In my Kia Sorrento. You get in. There's candles in the car. You go 'Is that dangerous?"" and I go, Yes... but I like danger. We go to your favorite restaurant, and we have a fantastic meal. We come outside and we see my cars on fire. You go, ""Aziz, your cars on fire. Aren't you upset?"" I pull out a bag of marshmallows and I go, No. I knew this was gonna happen. And then I kiss you. In front of my burning car."
Aziz Ansari,,What if I couldn’t read? I wouldn’t be able to text my friends movie times or even order cheese biscuits from Red Lobster!
Aziz Ansari,,Whats the worst that could happen?! The worst that could happen is he could cut off your legs and use them to make stilts that look like legs!
Aziz Ansari,,"When I walk around, sometimes people recognize me from things they've seen me in, TV or whatever. And they'd say, you know, stuff, and a lot of times, I wouldn't hear what they'd said because I had headphones on. So, I kinda just go, 'Cool, man. Glad you like the show.' And I'd just keep walking. And this one guy said something to me one time, and I went, 'Cool, man. Glad you like the show.' And then right when I walked past him, I realized, 'Oh, man, that guy didn't say anything about the show.' He went, 'Hey, man, your fly's down.' And I went, 'Cool, man. Glad you like the show. Glad you like seeing my dick pop out of my pants. Come back next week, you can see one of my balls.'"

Aziz Ansari,,"Oh yeah he thinks he’s possessed by Scar, the evil lion from lion king, because that happens!"
Aziz Ansari,"twitter,teachers","Everyday I start by hitting up Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram. Sometimes, I like to throw in LinkedIn, for the professional shawties. Then I like to go on Reddit. Reddit is great because it has all the important links. Wikipedia! Mankind’s greatest invention. You can learn about anything. Take Ray J for example. We all know he’s a singer, he’s Brandy’s brother, and he was in that classic sex tape with Kim Kardashian. But did you also know he’s Snoop Dog’s cousin and he was in the 96th Tim Burton movie Mars Attacks?! Suddenly, you’re on the Mars Attacks page. I love gChat, you can talk to anybody! I hit up brad.pitt. It wasn’t the actor. It was actually a guy named Brad that’s a teacher in Pittsburgh. We don’t have a lot in common, but we chat quite a bit. Emojis are little cartoons you text instead of words. Instead of saying, ‘What up, boo?’ you can type ‘What up’ and then a cute little ghost because that means boo. There’s even a little Indian guy, but he has a turban on, which I think is racist. But the Asian guy also has a racist hat on. And it’s like, hold up didn’t Japanese people invent this?! Podcasts! They’re a million of them and they’re all amazing! Jean Ralphio and I have one called Nacho Average Podcast where we rate different kinds of nachos."
Aziz Ansari,,"I'm not making this up - he goes 'Now if your neighbor marries a box turtle, that doesn't affect your everyday life. But that doesn't mean it's right.' I think it's pretty safe to assume that, at one point or another, Senator John Cornyn has thought about making love to a box turtle. I'm sorry, but that's not the first animal you jump to when you're writing that analogy."
Aziz Ansari,challenges,"I heard this guy going around talking about how he was this big rap producer, and he was just going around and boasting and bragging. And in one of those bragging sessions, I heard him just tell somebody, 'Hey, hey - why don't you try making four beats a day for two summers?' What a dangerously specific challenge that is."
Aziz Ansari,,"I think you sound like an angel, and everyone else sounds like demons."
Aziz Ansari,,"This is one of my favorite pick up strategies: I'm constantly giving women my keys. So far, none of them have shown up. Matter of time. And I've been robbed twice."
Aziz Ansari,,"She broke up with me. Didn’t really tell me why. Luckily when you’re the guy, you can just tell people she’s crazy. ‘Hey, Tom, I heard you and Lucy broke up.’ ‘Yeah, man. Turns out, she’s crazy.’ That’s what they always do on Entourage."
Aziz Ansari,dating,"When I’m dating someone, I have a list called my ‘Oh No Nos.’ If a woman commits a Oh No No, it can end the relationship. Not loving ‘90s R&B music is #3 on the Oh No Nos list. Girl don’t even know who Ginuwine is."
Aziz Ansari,birthday,"Your favorite kind of cake can’t be birthday cake, that’s like saying your favorite kind of cereal is breakfast cereal."
Aziz Ansari,new york,"One of the big things I miss about New York is not my friends so much; it's Shake Shack, the burger place. I miss Shake Shack."
Aziz Ansari,,"Make-A-Baby Tuxedo clothing line. A department store with a guest list. White fur earmuffs for men. Contact lenses that display text messages. Invent a phone that smells good. Own a nightclub, call it Eclipse, that’s only open for one hour two times a year. Cover charge? Five thousand dollars."
Aziz Ansari,,She's never seen a single Paul Walker movie? That's a huge Oh-No-No! She also doesn't care about Blu-ray?!
Aziz Ansari,art,I have no interest in art. Let me clarify - I have no interest in non-nude images.
Aziz Ansari,,"Most people would say ‘the deets’, but I say ‘the tails’. Just another example of innovation."
Aziz Ansari,,My father's cock went into my mother's cunt in the backroom of a Cinnabon. That's how I was born.

Aziz Ansari,,I want to take that cheese and do terrible things to it.
Aziz Ansari,"driving,future","I like living in L.A. One thing I don't like about living here is driving. I always get bored when I'm driving, and when I get bored, I go on the Internet on my Blackberry. So I'm gonna die! And whenever they go through the wreckage, they'll find my phone and be like, whoa, that's what he looked up right before he died? Gonna be so sad. It'll be like: Comedian Aziz Ansari was killed in a car accident today. He was struck by another vehicle while using IMDb to see if Val Kilmer was, indeed, in the film ""Willow."" A representative for Mr. Kilmer confirmed he was, indeed, in the film and hopes this will prevent future tragedies of this nature. This is the third ""Willow""-related death this year."
Aziz Ansari,,"When I tour, it's like, well, like a food tour as much as a comedy tour. I try to eat at all the weird places, the obscure barbecue joints, burger places. There are a few spots in L.A. that I'm obsessed with - one of them is the Taco Zone taco truck on Alvarado. There are secret off-menu items that are amazing."
Aziz Ansari,,"I was 18 when I started. I was hanging out with some friends and they asked if I had tried stand-up before. I hadn't, but I thought: 'What the hell?' So I went to an open mic night, and I liked it."

Aziz Ansari,,"Texting With Girls Dangerously Delicious Preview. I’ll text a girl, she text me back right away, I text her back right away, she text me back right away, I text her back right away, she text me back right away, I text her back right away, she text me back right away. Then I’ll say something like: “alright cool, you wanna get pizza on Tuesday?” And I don’t hear anything."
Aziz Ansari,ice cream,"I went to a place recently I think is one of the most fucked up places I've ever been to. I'm convinced this place is the epitome of American excess, of American greed. I'm talking about a place called Cold Stone Creamery. Whoa. If you have not been there, the basic gist of Cold Stone is that they take ice cream and then they just go ape shit with it."
Aziz Ansari,,I'm in a situation with this girl that's as hopeless as overthrowing the Bush administration.
Aziz Ansari,future,"Zerts’ are what I call desserts. ‘Trée-trées’ are entrées. I call sandwiches ‘sammies,’ ‘sandoozles,’ or ‘Adam Sandlers.’ Air conditioners are ‘cool blasterz’ with a ‘z’ - I don’t know where that came from. I call cakes ‘big ol’ cookies.’ I call noodles ‘long-ass rice.’ Fried chicken is ‘fry-fry chicky-chick.’ Chicken parm is ‘chicky-chicky-parm-parm.’ Chicken cacciatore? ‘Chicky-cacc.’ I call eggs ‘pre-birds,’ or ‘future birds.’ Root beer is ‘super water.’ Tortillas are ‘bean blankets.’ And I call forks ‘food rakes.’"

Aziz Ansari,,"After you do a joke a few times, you have material that you know works. Although sometimes I have a joke that has worked a bunch of times and then one night it'll flop. And that's when I really take a hard look at myself and say: 'Well, that crowd is obviously wrong. That crowd has absolutely no idea what it's talking about.'"
Aziz Ansari,,I'm kind of obsessed with food. I like to eat.

Aziz Ansari,dancing,"Every time I've done comedy in, like, traditional comedy clubs, there's always these comedians that do really well with audiences but that the other comedians hate because they're just, you know, doing kind of cheap stuff like dancing around or doing, like, very kind of base sex humor a lot, and stuff like that."

Bernie Mac,audience,"I wanted to be the best that I could be, first for myself, then for an audience. I love to see a smile on somebody's face... If I can tell someone a story that makes them bend over and laugh, that's bigger than anything else."
Bernie Mac,,"Son of bitch kids too God damn smart for me. Sassy-talking, shaking heads and shit. “Talk to the hand. Talk to the hand.” See, I’m from the old school, I’ll kick a kid ass.

Bill Cosby,ice cream,"It`s the little things that count when you`re a daddy. Like taking your little girl for ice cream. First, you have to teach her about the concept of gravity. I can`t tell you how many ice creams I`ve had to pick up off the floor, rinse off and stick back on my kid`s cone. Now that may sound strange, but have you bought ice cream lately? Good gosh, it`s up to 75 cents a scoop. A scoop! What`s in it, gold?"

And then you see these toddlers walking around with these Ziploc baggies full of Cheerios. Then you get to be my age, and the doctor wants you to start eating Cheerios to watch your cholesterol.

Ladies, you wake up tomorrow and the newspaper reads ""Scientists have discovered a way for men to experience childbirth."" That would be awesome. Getting invited to the Playboy Mansion on trampoline night. That would be awesome. And I started thinking what would be awesome for Bill Engvall? What would leave me in awe and wonder? And it would have to be if I left this stage tonight and went back to my hotel room. And Shania Twain met me at my door, wearing nothing but a fur coat, holding a note from my wife that said ""have a good time."" That would be awesome! It ain't gonna happen; but that would be awesome."

Bill Engvall,,"I thought, ""I'm gonna try that at my house!"" Well apparently, bologna and string cheese is not a real big turn on to a blindfolded woman."

They're the perfect toy! You squish them, mush them, POOF! They come right back out! You can't even break 'em! Oh god, they're amazing.

That girl sitting next to you shows you her boobs, you're like, ""This day was great!"""

She goes ""Bill, someone tells you they're getting a divorce and you don't ask any questions?"" And I go ""Well, that's because he didn't ask me a question!

Bill Engvall,dogs,"I took Duke to the vet ’cause he eats his own turds, and I asked the vet, “Isn’t that unusual?” and he says, “No, a lot of dogs do that. Just take some of this powder here, sprinkle it on his food and it’ll make him stop.” I said, “What’s it do?” He says, “It makes his turds taste bad.”,
Bill Engvall,,"I’m sorry, Doc, did you just say ‘it will make his turds taste bad’?” Let me tell you something, if you’ve stooped to eating turds, you’ve never uttered the phrase, “Oh my God! This is nasty!”"

Bill Engvall,,"Well, you know the rule: The person who builds it gets to try it first, so my son was at school and I built the trampoline and start to go on it, my wife goes, ""Hey, why don't you wait until he comes home?"" I said, ""Hey, why don't you hush... please?"" Hey, I ain't that big an idiot, all right? So, I was jumping on the trampoline, and I was thinking, ""Oh I remember this."" Started doing seat drops and knee drops and then I got cocky. One thing I learned about a trampoline, if you don't land square, you go up at an angle. And you don't come down at that same angle, you go down at an equal and opposite angle. Yeah, I'm 20 feet in the air and NOW my high school geometry kicks in. I curled into the fetal position, banged against the rail. My wife's laughing so hard, she nearly peed herself. Two important things I learned that day. One, the springs will pull the hair off your legs, and two, the dog doesn't like to jump."
Bill Engvall,,"I swear to you, I am the cheapest drunk on the planet. It takes nothing to get me loopy and doing stupid stuff. Yeah. Some of you like that? Well... like riding an electric floor buffer for a shot of tequila. Did it!"
Bill Engvall,,"My son is 12 now, and is really getting into girls. A lot. But the thing about twelve year old boys is that they don't possess what I like to call that discretionary gene yet. We were walking home from the ballfield the other day and there was a woman walking towards us who was gifted. I saw them, and I saw him see them. But she was too close for me to go, ""Dude, shut up."" She hadn't walked two feet behind us and he goes ""God dang, did you see the size of those things?"" And all I could say was ""Yeah, I did!"""
Bill Engvall,,"I think my wife puts up with me ‘cause I try. I think that’s all any guy can do is just try. That’s right! ‘Cause we ain’t never gunna get it. ‘Cause as soon as we get close you ladies change it. It’s like this memo goes out, ‘they’re getting close, change it, change it!’"
Bill Engvall,,I was a dork hunter. That’s hard to do. I fell out of a tree.
Bill Engvall,,"We get in the club, and we are totally out of our element. There's this synthesizer-computer music going, there's these laser lights and black lights. It's just not our kind of gig. So we're standing there having a beer and all of sudden my friend goes, 'Hey man, check out that table over there. Those girls'. And there was a table of really young girls. Old enough to be in a bar, but younger than us. And I go 'Yeah'. And he goes 'I think they're checking you out'. I go 'Shut up. They're not checking me out'. Of course, in my head, I'm going 'Hell yeah, they're checking me out! What are you not seeing?'. And he goes 'Nah man, I think they're gonna come over'. I go 'Shut up'. And all of sudden, this one stands up, and she's about 5'10"", smoking hot. She's got a little, tight dress on, cut up to the hip and she has locked eyes on me. And my friend goes 'Dude, you are dead'. And I turned around to talk to them and - this is when you know you have really good friends - they have all taken a step back from me. So now I'm just the turd in the punch bowl. And she is walking right at me and I'm thinking 'Oh my God'. In my head, this whole scenario is going down. I'm thinking 'Just be cool, let her down easy...'. And she walks up to me and says 'Hi'. And I go 'Hi'. She goes 'I'm Bridget'. And I go 'Hi Bridget, I'm fifty. And you're hot'. And I go 'So why don't we do this? Look, before this gets awkward, let me just buy your table a round of drinks, we'll call it a night, and it'll be over'. And she goes 'Okay. But we thought you were Cindy's dad. She's puking in the bathroom so we called him'."

Bill Engvall,,"I want you to think back to when you were a kid. Remember the day you learned you could burn ants with a magnifying glass? Oh, what a great day that was! You got to be God. You decided who lived, who died. I must've burned ants for an hour, just laughing. Then I saw one on my arm. Let me tell you something, when you burn yourself with a magnifying glass, you're on your own. You can't even tell your mom, because she gives that face, ""Oh, he is that stupid."""

Bill Engvall,,"See, all this stuff is turning me into this guy I don't want to be: that grouchy old, get-off-my-yard guy. Remember that guy? He was like 'Ah get off my yard! I hate everyone. I hate kids'. It's making me this grouchy guy and I don't want to be it. But I'll give you a great example. The other day, I was in my car and I got stuck behind a school bus. Now, I don't know if you've been stuck behind a school bus before, but once you're there, you're stuck. I've passed kidney stones quicker than you can get around a school bus."

I'm just checking on It"" There's your sign!"
Bill Engvall,dogs,"My wife got us a catalog of stuff just for our dogs. 42 pages of things just for our dogs. She bought a feeding dish this high off the ground.

She said, “It helps his digestion!” I said, “His digestion’s just fine! I pick it up out of the yard every morning.”"
Bill Engvall,,"So I go to this spa, and it was weird. They had pillows all over the floor, Zamfir music playing, water flowing over rocks, supposed to relax you. Made me have to go pee! Then she starts rubbing my butt! Yeah! All I could think was “Don’t fart!” Yeah, you’ve thought about it, haven’t you! ‘Cause when you’re standing up and you’ve got gas, you can clench it in. When someone’s rubbing your butt cheeks east and west, you’re bound to let one of those icky dog farts squirt out."

Bill Engvall,husband,"She sits down across the table from me, and didn't say ""Hi, hello, my name is..."" She just said ""this is what I'm going to tell my husband when he gets home from work today. I'm going to tell him that I had lunch with Jeff Foxworthy."""

Now, the other side of that coin is that - cause you're in your fifties - you still care what people think about you. So you kind of filter what you say.

And I felt bad, but he overreacted, I thought. I mean, it wasn't like a square hit; it just kind of glanced off his head. But he goes whippin' his car off the freeway, like ""here we go!"" Mr. Attitude! So now, he's barreling down the fairway screaming at the top of his lungs, like ""what are you, some kind of cruddy golfer?"" I'm like, ""hey, I hit you, didn't I?

Bill Hicks,parents,One of my big fears in life is that I'm gonna die and my parents are going to come to clean out my apartment and find that porno wing I've been adding on to for years.
Bill Hicks,people,"I just have one of those faces. People come up to me and say, ""What's wrong?"" Nothing. ""Well, it takes more energy to frown than it does to smile."" Yeah, you know it takes more energy to point that out than it does to leave me alone?"
Bill Hicks,"life,smoking","They proved that if you quit smoking, it will prolong your life. What they haven't proved is that a prolonged life is a good thing. I haven't seen the stats on that yet."
Bill Hicks,religion,"People tell me, 'Bill, let it go. The Kennedy assassination was years ago. It was just the assassination of a President and the hijacking of our government by a totalitarian regime — who cares? Just let it go.' I say, 'All right then. That whole Jesus thing? Let it go! It was 2,000 years ago! Who cares?'"
Bill Hicks,"dancing,embarrassment","See I don't drink, I smoke. I used to drink, I did, I had to quit. Man, I was an embarrassing drunk. I'd get pulled over by the cops, I'd be so drunk I'd be out dancing to their lights thinking I'd made it to another club. Hey what is this, a leather bar? Hey I'm not into this, you faggots, oh SHIT!"
Bill Hicks,holocaust,I can't watch TV longer than five minutes without praying for nuclear holocaust.

Bill Hicks,truth,"I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit."
Bill Hicks,drugs,"I loved when Bush came out and said, ""We are losing the war against drugs."" You know what that implies? There's a war being fought, and the people on drugs are winning it."
Bill Hicks,,"I was told when I grew up I could be anything I wanted: a fireman, a policeman, a doctor - even president, it seemed. And for the first time in the history of mankind, something new, called an astronaut. But like so many kids brought up on a steady diet of westerns, I always wanted to be the avenging cowboy hero - that lone voice in the wilderness, fighting corruption and evil wherever I fount it, and standing for freedom, truth, and justice. And in my heart of hearts I still track the remnants of that dream wherever I go, in my endless ride into the setting sun."
Bill Hicks,,"I don't mean to sound bitter, cold, or cruel, but I am, so that's how it comes out."
Bill Hicks,drugs,"Your denial is beneath you, and thanks to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, I see through you."
Bill Hicks,"smoking,soul",I smoke to fill the potholes in my soul.
Bill Hicks,laws,"I'm glad mushrooms are against the law, because I took them one time, and you know what happened to me? I laid in a field of green grass for four hours going, ""My God! I love everything."" Yeah, now if that isn't a hazard to our country … how are we gonna justify arms dealing when we realize that we're all one?"
Bill Hicks,change,"It's really weird how your life changes. Tonight I'm drinking water. Four years ago? Opium. Night and day, you know?"
Bill Hicks,,As long as one person lives in darkness then it seems to be a responsibility to tell other people.

Bill Hicks,"babies,abortion","I'm not a girl, I'm a guy you know? But at the same time, I tell ya how you can solve this abortion issue right now. Ready? Those unwanted babies that single moms leave in alleys and in dumpsters? Leave about 12 of those on the steps of The Supreme Court. This is over. Like that. ""You guys said we had to have them? Then you guys... fucking raise 'em."" ""Raise 'em then, you fucking fucking raise 'em. You raise 'em. You said I had to have it? Then it's yours. Fuck. It's yours... Take it."""
Bill Hicks,army,"This needs to be said: there never was a war. ""How can you say that, Bill?"" Well, a war is when two armies are fighting. So you can see, right there, there never was a war..."
Bill Hicks,"army,airports","People say ""Iraq had the fourth largest army in the world"". Yeah, maybe, but you know what, after the first 3 largest armies, there's a real big fucking drop-off. The Hare Krishnas are the 5th largest army in the world, and they've already got all our airports."

Bill Hicks,,"I don't get along with anything, I really don't. I'm just - I'm, I'm, maybe I'm just a, you know, incredibly tasteful human being."
Bill Hicks,new york,"I was in a cab in New York. The cab had a sign, ""Please do not smoke, Christ is our unseen guest."" This guy was reaching. I figure, if he could overcome being nailed to a cross, I don't think a Marlboro Light's gonna faze him that much."
Bill Hicks,smoking,"I have something to tell you non-smokers that I know for a fact that you don't know, and I feel it's my duty to pass on information at all times. Ready? Non-smokers die every day... Enjoy your evening. See, I know that you entertain this eternal life fantasy because you've chosen not to smoke, but let me be the 1st to POP that bubble and bring you hurling back to reality... You're dead too."
Bill Hicks,"laws,marijuana",Why is marijuana against the law? It grows naturally upon our planet. Doesn’t the idea of making nature against the law seem to you a bit... unnatural?
Bill Hicks,drugs,"Not all drugs are good, all right? Some of them... are great. Just gotta know your way around them, is all."
Bill Hicks,"alcohol,drugs,smoking,business","Here is my final point. About drugs, about alcohol, about pornography and smoking and everything else. What business is it of yours what I do, read, buy, see, say, think, who I fuck, what I take into my body - as long as I do not harm another human being on this planet?"
Bill Hicks,"kids,beat","I never got along with my dad. Kids used to come up to me and say, ""My dad can beat up your dad."" I'd say Yeah? When?"
Bill Hicks,abortion,"We gotta come to some new ideas about life folks ok? I'm not being blase about abortion, it might be a real issue, it might not, doesn't matter to me. What matters is that if you believe in the sanctity of life then you believe it for life of all ages. That's what I hate about this child-worship syndrome going on. ""Save the children! They're killing children! How many children were at Waco? They're killing children!"" What does that mean? They reach a certain age and they're off your fucking love-list? Fuck your children, if that's the way you think then fuck you too. You either love all people of all ages or you shut the fuck up."

Bill Hicks,"life,dreams",Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves.
Bill Hicks,,It's always funny until someone gets hurt. Then it's just hilarious.

Bill Hicks,smoking,"I smoke. If this bothers anyone, I suggest you look around at the world in which we live and shut your fucking mouth."
Bill Hicks,,"If you're so pro-life, do me a favour: don't lock arms and block medical clinics. If you're so pro-life, lock arms and block cemeteries."
Bill Hicks,,"And if I can take part in it by transforming my own consciousness, then someone else's, I'm happy to do it."
Bill Hicks,change,"It's just a ride and we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money, a choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one."
Bill Hicks,drugs,"I've had good times on drugs, that's a fact. I've had bad times on drugs, too, ok? But I've had good and bad relationships... and I'm not giving up pussy."
Bill Hicks,decisions,"How about a positive LSD story? Wouldn't that be news-worthy, just the once? To base your decision on information rather than scare tactics and superstition and lies? I think it would be news-worthy."
Bill Hicks,religion,I find it ironic that people who are against things that cause sexual thoughts are generally fundamentalist Christians who also believe you should be fruitful and multiply.
Bill Hicks,"army,airports","People say, ""Uh-Uh, Bill, Iraq had the fourth-largest army in the world."" Yeah, well, maybe, but, you know what? After the first three largest armies there's a really big fucking drop-off, okay? The Hare Krishnas are the fifth largest army in the world, and they've already got all our airports. So, who is the bigger threat?"
Bill Hicks,help,"God help me. I'm so tired. I need my sleep. I make no bones about it. I need eight hours a day, and at least ten at night..."
Bill Hicks,"television,advertising","Supreme Court says pornography is anything without artistic merit that causes sexual thoughts, that's their definition, essentially. No artistic merit, causes sexual thoughts. Hmm... Sounds like... every commercial on television, doesn't it? You know, when I see those two twins on that Doublemint commercial? I'm not thinking of gum. I am thinking of chewing, so maybe that's the connection they're trying to make."
Bill Hicks,john lennon,"We live in a world where John Lennon was murdered, yet Barry Manilow continues to put out fucking albums. God-dammit! If you're gonna kill somebody, have some fucking taste. I'll drive you to Kenny Rogers' house."
Bill Hicks,,"I saw a sign on the side of the road in Tennessee once that said 'dirt for sale'...what a great country we live in. Dirt for sale. How would you like to get inside that guys mind and look around for a hour? That guy sees opportunity at every glance, doesn't he? It's a big world for this gentleman. 'Oh my god, honey! Honey quit servin' waffles and come here baby. I'm gunna sell dirt! Look it's everywhere. You need it for our planet, honey!' The place was called Land Land."
Bill Hicks,people,"People say to me, ""Hey, Bill, the war made us feel better about ourselves."" Really? What kind of people are these with such low self-esteem that they need a war to feel better about themselves? May I suggest, instead of a war to feel better about yourself, perhaps… sit-ups? Maybe a fruit cup? Eight glasses of water a day?"
Bill Hicks,,"Remember this shit, if you play certain rock albums backwards there'd be satanic messages? Let me tell you something, if you're sitting round your house playing your albums backwards, you are Satan. You needn't look any further. And don't go ruining my stereo to prove a point either."
Bill Hicks,men,"I can speak for every guy in this room here tonight. Guys, if you could blow yourselves, ladies, you'd be in this room alone right now. Watching an empty stage."
Bill Hicks,"music,devil,hell,heaven","They tell us ""Rock'n'roll is the devil's music."" Well, let's say we know that rock is the devil's music, and we know that it is, for sure … At least he fucking jams! If it's a choice between eternal Hell and good tunes, and eternal Heaven and New Kids on the fucking Block … I'm gonna be surfin' on the lake of fire, rockin' out."
Bill Hicks,smoking,"What I do, and I know all smokers do this. You know how every cigarette pack has a different surgeon general's warning on it, how cool. Mine say, ""Smoking may cause fetal injury or premature birth."" ...fuck it. I found my brand. Just don't get the ones that say, ""Lung Cancer,"" ya know, shop around. Hell gimme a carton of them Low Birth Weights. What the fuck do I care? 'Why you so down Bill?' Low Birth Weight. Yeah, I'm smokin' way too many Low Birth Weights."
Bill Hicks,"drugs,advertising","I can't believe a war against drugs when they have anti-drug commercials on TV all day long followed by ""This Bud is for you."""
Bill Hicks,,"I'm Bill Hicks, and I'm dead now, 'cause I smoked cigarrettes... cigarrettes didn't kill me, a bucnh of non-smokers kicked the living shit out of me one night."
Bill Hicks,"drugs,honesty","No, I don't do drugs anymore, either. But I'll tell you something about drugs. I used to do drugs, but I'll tell you something honestly about drugs, honestly, and I know it's not a very popular idea, you don't hear it very often anymore, but it is the truth: I had a great time doing drugs. Sorry. Never murdered anyone, never robbed anyone, never raped anyone, never beat anyone, never lost a job, a car, a house, a wife or kids, laughed my ass off, and went about my day."
Bill Hicks,dinosaurs,"Dinosaur fossils? ""God put those there to test our faith."" Thank God I'm strapped in right now here man. I think God put you here to test my faith, Dude. You believe that? ""Uh huh."" Does that trouble anyone here? The idea that God... might be... fuckin' with our heads? I have trouble sleeping with that knowledge. Some prankster God running around: ""Hu hu ho. We will see who believes in me now, ha HA."""
Bill Hicks,intelligence,"This is where we are at right now, as a whole. No one is left out of the loop. We are experiencing a reality based on a thin veneer of lies and illusions. A world where greed is our God and wisdom is sin, where division is key and unity is fantasy, where the ego-driven cleverness of the mind is praised, rather than the intelligence of the heart."
Bill Hicks,,I believe that there is an equality to all humanity: We all suck.
Bill Hicks,drugs,The Beatles were so high they let Ringo sing a couple of tunes.
Bill Hicks,,I believe everyone has this fuckin' poem in his heart.
Bill Hicks,government,"Go back to bed, America. Your government has figured out how it all transpired. Go back to bed, America. Your government is in control again. Here. Here's American Gladiators. Watch this, shut up. Go back to bed, America. Here is American Gladiators. Here is 56 channels of it! Watch these pituitary retards bang their fucking skulls together and congratulate you on living in the land of freedom. Here you go, America! You are free to do what we tell you! You are free to do what we tell you!"
Bill Hicks,,"I'm gonna share with you a vision that I had, cause I love you. And you feel it. You know all that money we spend on nuclear weapons and defense each year, trillions of dollars, correct? Instead - just play with this - if we spent that money feeding and clothing the poor of the world - and it would pay for it many times over, not one human being excluded - we can explore space together, both inner and outer, forever in peace. Thank you very much. You've been great, I hope you enjoyed it."
Bill Hicks,"smoking,addiction",I'm a heavy smoker. I go through two lighters a day.
Bill Hicks,new york,"Now, I'm no bleeding heart, OK? But... when you're walking down the streets of New York City and you're stepping over a guy on the sidewalk who, I don't know, might be dead... Does it ever occur to you to think, ""Wow. Maybe our system doesn't work?"""
Bill Hicks,,All governments are lying cocksuckers.
Bill Hicks,money,"It's all about money, not freedom, ya'll, okay? Nothing to do with fucking freedom. If you think you're free, try going somewhere without fucking money, okay?"
Bill Hicks,advertising,"Do a commercial, you're off the artistic roll call, every word you say is suspect, you're a corporate whore and eh, end of story."
Bill Hicks,politics,"I'll show you politics in America. Here it is, right here. ""I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs."" ""I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking."" Hey, wait a minute, there's one guy holding out both puppets!"
Bill Hicks,,It seems to me that there will be a point in out development or our evolution where you put your guns aside.
Bill Hicks,questions,"My voice was not heard, the questions were not asked that I wanted to see asked."
Bill Hicks,,"I'll tell you, too, that's starting to depress me about UFO's, about the fact that they cross galaxies, or wherever they come from to visit us, and always end up in places like Fife, Alabama. Maybe these are not super-intelligent beings, man."
Bill Hicks,"drugs,music","If you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, then go home and burn all your records, all your tapes, and all your CDs because every one of those artists who have made brilliant music and enhanced your lives? Real fucking high on drugs. The Beatles were so fucking high they let Ringo sing a few songs."
Bill Hicks,,Children are smarter than any of us. Know how I know that? I don't know one child with a full time job and children.
Bill Hicks,"smoking,new york","People tell me ""hey if you quit smoking, you'll get your sense of smell back."" I live in New York City, I got news for you folks, I don't want my fucking sense of smell back."
Bill Hicks,"abortion,friends,intelligence","I, ah... this abortion issue in the States is dividing the country right in half. You know, and even amongst my friends - we're all highly intelligent - they're totally divided on the issue of abortion. Totally divided. Some of my friends think these pro-life people are just annoying idiots. Other of my friends think these pro-life people are evil fucks. How are we gonna have a consensus? I'm torn. I try and take the broad view and think of them as evil, annoying fucks."
Bill Hicks,,"I generally love my job. You know what the great thing about being a comic is? I have no boss. That's a definite lifestyle plus isn't it? Aren't bosses something? They're like gnats at a picnic man. Get the fuck out of here buddy, it's just a job, doesn't mean a thing. I smoked a joint this morning, you're lucky I showed. My bed was like a womb man."
Bill Hicks,,"People often ask me where I stand politically. It's not that I disagree with Bush's economic policy or his foreign policy, it's that I believe he was a child of Satan sent here to destroy the planet Earth. Little to the left."
Bill Hicks,"kids,girlfriends,philosophy","That’s why my girlfriend and I broke up: she wanted kids, and I... well, she wanted kids. I had no idea her philosophy was that flawed. She goes, “Wouldn’t it be nice to have a kid? To have this fresh, clean slate which we could fill. A little clean spirit, innocent, and to fill it with good ideas.” Yeah, yeah, how about this? If you’re so fucking altruistic, why don’t you leave the little clean spirit wherever it is right now? Okay? Horrible act, childbirth. Nightmare. Bringing... I would never bring a kid to this fucking planet."
Bill Hicks,"life,death,dreams","Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the Weather."
Bill Hicks,"men,women,dreams","I've learned a lot about women. I think I've learned exactly how the fall of man occured in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, and Adam said one day, ""Wow, Eve, here we are, at one with nature, at one with God, we'll never age, we'll never die, and all our dreams come true the instant that we have them."" And Eve said, ""Yeah... it's just not enough is it?"""
Bill Hicks,,"The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question: ""Is this real, or is this just a ride?"" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, ""Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride."" And we kill those people."
Bill Hicks,,I get a kick out of being an outsider constantly. It allows me to be creative. I don't like anything in the mainstream and they don't like me.
Bill Hicks,"government,democracy","I love talking about the Kennedy assasination. The reason I do is because I'm fascinated by it. I'm fascinated that our government could lie to us so blatantly, so obviously for so long, and we do absolutely nothing about it. I think that's interesting in what is ostensibly a democracy. Sarcasm - come on in. People say ""Bill, quit talking about Kennedy man. It was a long time ago, just let it go, alright? It's a long time ago, just forget it."" I'm like, alright, then don't bring up Jesus to me. As long as we're talking shelf life here..."
Bill Hicks,,"People are bringing shotguns to UFO sightings in Fife, Alabama. I asked a guy, ""Why do you bring a gun to a UFO sighting?"" Guy said, ""Way-ul, we didn' wanna be ab-duc-ted."" If I lived in Fife, Alabama, I would be on my hands and knees every night praying for abduction."
Bill Hicks,sex,"You know what causes sexual thoughts? I'm gonna clear the air for you tonight. I'm gonna end this debate, hopefully once and for all while on this planet, 'cause outer space awaits our presence, we are better and more unique creatures than this and all eternity is our playground, so let me go ahead and clear this one issue up once and for all and let's move on to real issues. Can we? Great. Here's what causes sexual thoughts. Ready, drumroll: having a dick."
Bill Hicks,,People in the United Kingdom and outside the United States share my bemusement with the United States that America doesn't share with itself.
Bill Hicks,,"Ultimately, it is in fun. It is supposed to be highly entertaining."
Bill Hicks,"drugs,jail","Why do we put people who are on drugs in jail? They're sick, they're not criminals. Sick people don't get healed in prison. You see? It makes no sense."
Bill Hicks,coffee,"There's some serious pockets of humanity out there. Go to some of these truck stops in the middle of nowhere you'll meet some serious folk. Order coffee the guy behind the counter goes 'you want the 32 oz. or the large?' Shit, how big is that large? 'You goin' want to pull yer car 'round back, I goin' start that pump.' That sounds like a lot of coffee, dude. I don't know if I want to be awake that long in Tennessee. On second thought give me that pussy size."
Bill Hicks,,"Listen, the next revolution is gonna be a revolution of ideas."
Bill Hicks,,"When two or more people agree on an issue, I form on the other side."
Bill Hicks,,"Folks, it's time to evolve. That's why we're troubled. You know why our institutions are failing us, the church, the state, everything's failing? It's because, um – they're no longer relevant. We're supposed to keep evolving. Evolution did not end with us growing opposable thumbs. You do know that, right? There's another 90 percent of our brains that we have to illuminate."
Bill Hicks,"alcohol,drugs","I am not promoting the use of drugs, I'm just saying if you're gonna have a war against drugs, have 'em against all drugs including alcohol, the number one offender, or shut the fuck up!"
Bill Hicks,drugs,I've never seen people on pot get in a fight because it is fucking impossible.
Bill Hicks,,"Yeah, good to be here. I haven't been here in two years... Thanks. It's that warmth I've missed in Austin. So, we been here, ain't our fault you gotta travel around, shit. We supposed to follow you around? You supposed to be back here. What are you doin', where are you?"
Bill Hicks,"alcohol,society,drugs","If you want to understand a society, take a good look at the drugs it uses. And what can this tell you about American culture? Well, look at the drugs we use. Except for pharmaceutical poison, there are essentially only two drugs that Western civilization tolerates: Caffeine from Monday to Friday to energize you enough to make you a productive member of society, and alcohol from Friday to Monday to keep you too stupid to figure out the prison that you are living in."
Bill Hicks,,"I'm sorry if any of you are catholic. I'm not sorry if you're offended, I'm actually just sorry by the fact that you're catholic."
Bill Hicks,,"So, it's good to be here, wherever I am."
Bill Hicks,,"Sometimes you feel in control, and it's great, but sometimes you just don't feel in control and you really have to struggle to get laughs."
Bill Hicks,,How dare you have wino tell me not to do drugs.
Bill Hicks,"drugs,smoking,differences,worth,marijuana","They lie about marijuana. Tell you pot-smoking makes you unmotivated. Lie! When you're high, you can do everything you normally do just as well - you just realize that it's not worth the fucking effort. There is a difference."
Bill Hicks,worth,"What did moths bump into before the electric light bulb was invented? Boy, the lightbulb really screwed the moth up didn't it? Are there moths on their way to the sun now going, ""It's gonna be worth it!"". "
Bill Hicks,advertising,"See we just had a misunderstanding. I thought we lived in the U.S. of A., the United States of America. But actually we live in the U.S. of A., the United States of Advertising. Freedom of expression is guaranteed? If you've got the money!"
Bill Hicks,homeless,"Watch CNN headline news for an hour, its the most depressing fucking thing: war, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression... And you look out your window... Where's all this shit happening?!"
Bill Maher,,"Bush didn't really win on his popularity last time. He won on scaring people that Kerry might do something stupid like, I don't know, sell the ports to the Arabs."
Bill Maher,"intelligence,white house","The Clinton White House today said they would start to give national security and intelligence briefings to George Bush. I don't know how well this is working out. Today after the first one Bush said, ""I've got one question: What color is the red phone?"""
Bill Maher,advertising,"I saw this anti-drug commercial that showed a kid smoking pot in his dad`s room with his friend. This kid finds a gun, the gun accidentally goes off and kills his friend. Only in America is the villain in this commercial not guns or bad parenting, but pot."
Bill Maher,,"Hi, I'm Bill. I'm a birth survivor."
Bill Maher,truth,"To me a real patriot is like a real friend. Who's your real friend? It's the person who tells you the truth. That's who my real friends are. So, you know, I think as far as our country goes, we need more people who will do that."
Bill Maher,religion,Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need.

Bill Maher,,"There's more than one mosque in the world that used to be a church and before that was a temple. Because it's a lot easier to just change the sign on the top and say ""under new management"" than it is to change the whole building."
Bill Maher,,Canadian bacon isn't bacon. It's ham.
Bill Maher,,"And then we get here and five minutes after we arrive, the skies open up. It's completely nice and there was a rainbow above the thing we were shooting. So, I don't know, if God didn't want us to shoot, he sure fucked up today."
Bill Maher,,Tiger Woods apologized to the three women in America he never got around to sleeping with.
Bill Maher,,"It's like the lotto. ""You can't get saved if you don't play."""
Bill Maher,religion,"Religions are maintained by people. People who can't get laid, because sex is the first great earthly pleasure. But if you can't get that, power is a pretty good second one. And that's what religion gives to people. Power. Power is sex for people who can't get or don't want or aren't any good at sex itself."
Bill Maher,sport,The only sport I really get into is snowboarding. Cause that’s the only sport where they perform a half pipe just after smoking a full pipe.
Bill Maher,marijuana,"Whenever the people are for gay marriage or medical marijuana or assisted suicide, suddenly the ""will of the people"" goes out the window."
Bill Maher,politics,"Don't you think that being a person of faith has become a third rail in American politics? If you want to run for president nowadays, you'd better get out there and say you're a very faith-based person."

I want him in a meeting with the BP CEOs, you know, where he lifts up his shirt so you can see the gun in his pants. That’s - ""we’ve got a motherfucking problem here?"" Shoot somebody in the foot."
Bill Maher,,"That’s America for you - a red herring culture, always scared of the wrong things. The fact is, there are a lot of creepy middle-aged men out there lusting for your kids. They work for MTV, the pharmaceutical industry, McDonald’s, Marlboro and K Street."
Bill Maher,,"If you, the citizen, deliberately vote for someone who won’t give you healthcare over someone who will, you need to have your head examined. Except you can’t afford to have your head examined."
Bill Maher,,"We survived the 1980's. Back then, the economic program was called ""trickle down."" That actually meant they were pissing on you. How the whole theory goes was this: ""We have all the money. If we drop some, it's yours. Go for it."""
Bill Maher,,The country can't get well if the people are sick. And the people are sick.
Bill Maher,democracy,"The Democrats are very bad at selling their own product. The Republicans are geniuses at it. And I've said it before, a bad product well apologized for is superior in this country to a good product."

Bill Maher,,Everything that used to be a sin is now a disease.
Bill Maher,,"I think we all remember that those first months after the attack, this country really was a very different country. I think we were ready to do anything. I think we would have marched into hell behind this guy... I think nobody in a position of leadership, not the Democrats, not the president, asked anyone in this country to rethink or redo anything. The most they asked us to do was to keep the economy going, to shop and go see shows again and travel."
Bill Maher,"care,government","If ketchup had 1/20th of the carcinogens in a cigarette they'd rip it off the shelves tomorrow, so the government is full of shit when they tell you that they care about you."
Bill Maher,religion,"How does a country get away with keeping half its population in beekeeper suits? I'll tell you how. They say the magic word: religion. It's their religion. You say religion, you can get away with anything. The Catholics got away with fucking kids, for crying out loud!"
Bill Maher,"drugs,worth","I'd like to protect children, too, but… is everything worth sacrificing to that? I mean, drugs have done a lot of good. … They've midwived a lot of good ideas… lot of great songs, you know? I think ""Penny Lane"" is worth 10 dead kids. … I think Dark Side of the Moon is worth 100 dead kids. There, I said it."
Bill Maher,,I have a theory that the Internet makes people stupider - and also FOX News makes people stupider.
Bill Maher,,"Again, America is a stupid country with stupid people who don’t pay attention."
Bill Maher,,"My generation didn`t face the kind of urgent, pressing issues that my parents did, who fought through a war and a Depression and know what suffering is. That`s why Bob Dole had a tough time with this electorate. He was an old-fashioned curmudgeon who knew about sacrifice, and we didn`t know if we could live up to his standards. But we knew we could live up to Bill Clinton`s. He`s more like one of us."
Bill Maher,,The food is out of this world!
Bill Maher,,"Anyone who is elected mayor of a place called ""Sin City"" is allowed to be a drunk."
Bill Maher,,New Rule: Stop whining about the French. It takes a lot of guts to stand up to the Bush administration and that's more than I can say about the Democrats!
Bill Maher,,You are what you do. It's about actions.
Bill Maher,,It`s all been satirized for your protection.
Bill Maher,white house,"The Dalai Lama visited the White House and told the President that he could teach him to find a higher state of consciousness. Then after talking to Bush for a few minutes, he said, ""You know what? Let's just grab lunch."""
Bill Maher,,"Iraq now says that it will, after all, destroy its missiles. President Bush said, ""Please, I used to pull the same trick. There'd be an intervention, I'd make a big show of pouring out the liquor and then there was a case under the floorboards."""
Bill Maher,,"This is a ridiculous heat wave we're in right now, and to contribute, Newt Gingrich said that for the entire month of June, he will stop blowing hot air."
Bill Maher,,"The country has become much more conservative, partly because it's been taken over by the religious right."
Bill Maher,,"The jury could get the case as early as next week, but the defense says they just want to introduce one last-minute load of crap."
Bill Maher,"9/11,vacation","You can't run on a mistake. Franklin Roosevelt didn't run for re-election claiming Pearl Harbor was his finest hour. Abe Lincoln was a great president, but the high point of his second term wasn't theater security. 9/11 wasn't a triumph of the human spirit. It was a fuck-up by a guy on vacation."
Bill Maher,,"There's no greater model, in my view, than Jesus Christ."
Bill Maher,,"Why are there so many puritans in this country, and why can’t the rest of us make them go away?!"
Bill Maher,"elvis presley,marijuana","We're so inconsistent about what we let kill ya. ""Smoking? Must be eradicated. Marijuana? Zero tolerance."" But there's lots of ways to kill yourself. You know what I think kills you? Stress, and being a workaholic, and never getting laid, and, uh, McDonalds, and staying mad at people, and lying for a living, and three-martini lunches, and the all-American breakfast, and whatever the fuck Elvis was doing. That's what kills you."
Bill Maher,,I think capital punishment works great. Every killer you kill never kills again.
Bill Maher,,Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking. It's nothing to brag about.
Bill Maher,,"This country has fuck-up fatigue. That's when someone fucks up so much, that when they fuck up again, people go, ""Well, what do you expect? He's a fuck-up."" And that's fucked up!"
Bill Maher,truth,"All I did was tell the truth. That's is what the whole show is about! And if ""Politically Incorrect"" has to go down for it, so be it!"
Bill Maher,,"If I just sit here every Friday night and spout Bush administration talking points, that's not information or entertainment, it's Fox News!"
Bill Maher,"white people,neighborhood","White people have always shown their superiority over blacks with their feet, moving out of black neighborhoods with the fear that their kids will turn into one of them. And now, through the magic of MTV, damned if it didn't turn out that way!"
Bill Maher,,"The Bush Administration is always saying, ""We don't hear the good news."" Yeah, because the journalists are saying, ""Cover me, I'm going to the ice machine."""
Bill Maher,"doctors,cancer","Doctors said that the test most commonly used to screen for colon cancer doesn't go far enough. They're recommending a procedure that involves photographing the entire colon. I say, don't vie CBS an idea for another reality show."
Bill Maher,worth,"A lot of good has come from drugs. I think ""Penny Lane"" is worth 10 dead kids. Dark Side of the Moon is worth 100 dead kids. Because a lot of kids wouldn't even be born if it weren't for that album, so it evens out."
Bill Maher,,"Sex is too easy for women to get, and too hard for men. I mean, honestly, for a man to walk into someplace and have every woman ready to take him home, he'd have to rule the world. A woman would have to do her hair."
Bill Maher,,"We do it all the time, we legislate taste. We do it with the tax code. Churches and children get a tax break, because it's assumed that we all agree that we want to encourage churches and children. I don't. I don't. That's my opinion. I don't want to encourage either churches or children, and it's a very bad idea to put them together."
Bill Maher,,"Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking - its nothing to brag about. And those who preach faith, and enable it, and elevate it, are our intellectual slaveholders - keeping mankind in a bondage to fantasy and nonsense that has spawned and justified so much lunacy and destruction."
Bill Maher,,"When sex is good theres nothing better, when its bad its not bad."
Bill Maher,,Little do women know what big ideas I have in my pants.

Bill Maher,,"God makes trees, he doesn't write books."
Bill Maher,,What's it going to take to get these people who refuse to believe that global warming exists to get in touch with reality? Where do they think exhaust goes - Bunnyland?
Bill Maher,,You can't claim you're for peace if you're not willing to disturb it.
Bill Maher,,"Anyone who tells you that they know, they just know what happens when you die, I promise you, you dont. How can I be so sure? Because I dont know and you do not possess mental powers that I do not."
Bill Maher,respect,I don't respect religon. I don't respect superstitious thinking and that is what religous is.
Bill Maher,"democracy,worth",You want to spend your millions on a worthless cause? Try donating it to the Democrats.

Bill Maher,,"Face the fact that there's only one sure-fire way to erase credit card debt. By picking up a big, shiny pair of scissors and cutting your wife in half."
Bill Maher,,"My father said, ""Bring along your best girl."" This is something you say to a pimp!"
Bill Maher,"religion,philosophy","Jesus, as a philosopher is wonderful. There's no greater role model, in my view, than Jesus Christ. It's just a shame that most of the people who follow him and call themselves Christians act nothing like him."
Bill Maher,,At least half of the Ten Commandments are stupid!
Bill Maher,,"I wish someone would just start Fly At Your Own Risk Airlines. How 'bout that? You can have your hair gel, you can have your lighter, you can have a fucking gun, how bout that? You can show up at the gate five minutes before the plane leaves, and pay in cash, like in the good ol' 1980's. The ticket just says ""shit happens"" on the back, because that's the way it is anyway."
Bill Maher,"religion,atheism",Atheism is a religion like abstinence is a sex position.
Bill Maher,,My wife always has a splitting archetype whenever I want to have sex.
Bill Maher,cocaine,"Space tourism is God's way of telling you you aren't spending enough on lap dances, baccarat and cocaine."
Bill Maher,school,When I was in high school the worst thing you could ever get was VD. Talk about the sniffles! I just want to meet an old-fashioned girl with gonorrhea.
Bill Maher,,In ancient times they sacrificed the virgins. Men were not about to sacrifice the sluts!
Bill Maher,army,"The rebel army in Libya is just like 1,000 guys in Toyota trucks. The world is asking the question; can 1000 anti-government guys in pick-up trucks with small arms, take over a country of millions? To which I say, ask the Teabaggers."
Bill Maher,"people,television,art","People have romantic notions about television. In the highest realms they think it's some sort of art medium, and it's not. Others think it's an entertainment medium, it's not that either. It's an advertising medium. It's a method to deliver advertising like a cigarette is a method to deliver nicotine."
Bill Maher,,Jim Bakker spells his name with 2 k's because 3 would be too obvious.
Bill Maher,"asians,new york",The New York Times - but the whole country gives it that weight. It's like the Asian kid in math class. Everybody in the media cheats off The New York Times.
Bill Maher,"religion,decisions","The plain fact is religion must die for mankind to live. The hour is getting very late to be able to indulge in having key decisions made by religious people - by irrationalists - by those who would steer the ship of state, not by a compass, but by the equivalent of reading the entrails of a chicken."
Bill Maher,,"The Founding Fathers were more deists. If you had to categorize them as anything. There was some sort of moving prime force. But it's an impersonal force. Some people call it Nature. Certainly not this personal god who you have a personal relationship with, who listens to your prayers and answers them, or doesn't. You know, not the silly stuff that most Americans believe because we're such a dumb nation."
Bill Maher,,"I get the Playboy thing a lot. People assume I go out with bimbos. I couldn`t go out with bimbos if I tried! I scare them off! The women that like me are smart. So I go to the Playboy Mansion four or five times a year, but people think I go all the time."
Bill Maher,democracy,"In America, if a Democrat even thinks you’re calling him liberal he grabs an orange vest and a rifle and heads into the woods to kill something."
Bill Maher,"terrorists,hollywood","By now you’ve heard the constant right wing attacks on the elite media and the liberal elite, who may or may not be part of Washington elite, a subset of the East Coast elite, which is overtly influenced by the Hollywood elite. So, basically, unless you’re a shit-kicker from Kansas, you’re with the terrorists."
Bill Maher,"ronald reagan,airports","What is with this campy fixation on all things Ronald Reagan? They talk about him the way gay people talk about Barbra Streisand. I think they just want him on a stamp so they can lick his ass. I think they only named an airport after him so they can say, ""I'm coming into Reagan!"""
Bill Maher,"dreams,pope,hollywood","I want to thank some very special people without whom I would not be here today. George Bush, Sarah Palin and the Pope. When I came to Hollywood in 1983, I had one dream - to sleep with Jodie Foster. That didn't work out, but this is nice, too."
Bill Maher,,"If conservatives get to call universal healthcare ""socialized medicine"", I get to call private, for-profit healthcare ""soulless, vampire bastards making money off human pain""."

Bill Maher,,"Curious people are intersting people, I wonder why that is."
Bill Maher,religion,We are a nation that is unenlightened because of religion. I do believe that. I think religion stops people from thinking. I think it justified crazies.
Bill Maher,,"People say I'm into black women. Robert De Niro is into black women. I'm just into women who are real, and they happen to be black."
Bill Maher,stuff,I think the funniest stuff comes from the heaviest stuff.
Bill Maher,,"If nobody is clear on what you're protesting, it's not a protest. Thousands of people gathered in London this week to voice their disapproval of the G-20. Their basic message being, ""Stop all your globalizing and unite the world!"""
Bill Maher,,"What is it with conservatives? Seriously, I'm not trying to be partisan but it seems like if they're anti-illegal alien, they have illegal aliens working for them. If they're anti-gay, they turn out to be gay. If they're super Christian, they're a witch."
Bill Maher,,"Recently, there's been a trend in America that I find very disturbing... rewarding immoral and illegal behavior...For example, we now give free needles to junkies, which seems to me to be only a step away from giving condoms to rapists."
Bill Maher,danger,I think what's dangerous is the idea that someone can wash away your sins.
Bill Maher,problems,"I don't dislike children, I just don't particularly want to be around with them a lot. Problem is, neither do their parents."
Bill Maher,,"It's so childish, ""greatest country in the world."" It's like saying, ""I have the best wife in the world. Not just the one best suited for me, the best wife in the world. And if you could have my wife, you'd kill your wife."""
Bill Maher,,Don't say a woman is crazy just because she runs away from her wedding.
Bill Maher,gays,"Is it like gay men go into the priesthood because they figure, ""Well, this'll solve my problem. I can't be a homosexual in the priesthood; it'll just go away. Maybe I'll try it with the Republican Party."""
Bill Maher,,"In this country, a smart leader is suspect. That's just the way it is. Even George Bush's father, who was a lot smarter than the son, had to sort of prove that he wasn't that bright."
Bill Maher,tattoos,"Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't make you spiritual. It's right above the crack of your ass, and it translate to ""beef with broccoli"". The last time you did anything spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not spiritual. You're just high."
Bill Maher,,The president is not doing well with African Americans. His popularity rating - his approval rating - with blacks: two percent. Two percent. That is somewhere between Mark Fuhrman and sickle cell anemia.
Bill Maher,,"People on the right say to people like me, ""Oh, you hate America."" And I always say, ""No, I love America. I want it back. I don't want you representing it. I don't want torture representing it."" If I hated it, I'd be okay with being represented by the torturers."
Bill Maher,,"A president can be unpopular for good reasons. You know, I'm not always on the side that the people are right, for God's sake. But, you know, he's not popular when he goes overseas. He couldn't go to Rosa Parks' funeral."
Bill Maher,,"Bush is in command. And when he heard that sectarian militias had killed hundreds of Iraqis, he called for an immediate invasion of Sectaria."
Bill Maher,hate,"I think girls hate each other, no doesn't always mean no, you have to lie to stay married, women's sports are boring and the Olympics are gay."
Bill Maher,cars,"All birds masturbate. Yeah, you thought that was shit on your car."
Bill Maher,sport,Guys you have way too much invested in sport. Guys you are not the tenth man. You're a machine for turning beer into piss that's what you are!
Bill Maher,obama,Obama is huge in the polls these days. His popularity is soaring. Even conservatives are coming around. 30 percent of them now believe Obama deserves a Green Card.
Bill Maher,obama,"There were two Republican responses to the State of the Union. So if you watched the whole night, it was kind of evolution in reverse. You have Obama, then Paul Ryan, and then Michele Bachmann. Then Animal Planet had a squirrel monkey give his take."
Bill Maher,"questions,rage","The younger generation is supposed to rage against the machine, not for it. They're supposed to question authority, not question those who question authority."
Bill Maher,hollywood,"Hollywood isn't your cesspool, America. It's your mirror."
Bill Maher,,"Like it or not, we’re still a primitive tribe ruled by fears, superstition and misinformation."
Bill Maher,,This has been a learning experience for me. I also thought that privacy was something we were granted in the Constitution. I have learned from this when in fact the word privacy does not appear in the Constitution.
Bill Maher,,"A group of Cuban Americans denounced the Castro government as a fascist regime that monitors and scrutinized its citizens' everyday existence. And then they excused themselves to go watch ""Big Brother""."
Bill Maher,"religion,questions,respect","I said I didn't respect religion... and anyone who believes in fairy tales to answer questions that we can't answer. So I don't respect our religions either. But I do believe it is a clash of civilizations, absolutely, between the Islamic world and the Western world. It has been going on for 1,000 years."
Bill Maher,"care,democracy","All across the Middle East in the streets, people are demanding democracy. It's amazing. The only way in America you get people to get worked up like that is to threaten to give them health care."
Bill Maher,religion,"Religion, it stops people from thinking because they think all the answers are in that one book; it impedes progress; it justifies crazy people. Flying planes into a building was a faith-based initiative."
Bill Maher,,"In no way was I intending to say, nor have I ever thought, that the men and women who defend our nation in uniform are anything but courageous and valiant, and I offer my apologies to anyone who took it wrong."
Bill Maher,,"That's right. It turns out we've all been taking relationship advice from the fat middle-aged, bald guy who drives a Ferrari!"
Bill Maher,,Clinton could have done a better job with the hurricane while having sex.
Bill Maher,,"I have a high state of resentment for the conformity in this country. If you`re not married and having children, it`s like your life is empty or you`re a communist meanie."
Bill Maher,society,I'll clue you in on a secret: death is not the worst thing that could happen to you. I know we think that; we are the first society ever to think that. It's not worse than dishonor; it's not worse than losing your freedom; its not worse than losing a sense of personal responsibility.
Bill Maher,,The other guys are selling certainty. Not me. I'm on the corner with doubt.
Bill Maher,stupidity,The true Axis of Evil in America is the genius of our marketing combined with the stupidity of our people.
Bill Maher,,"Jesus is not a candle. A company in South Dakota is selling candles with the scent of Jesus. You light one and your friends says, ""Christ, what's that smell?"""
Bill Maher,,False hope really makes you cynical.
Bill Maher,,"I think pornography stops rape, AIDS ribbons are stupid, and flag burning makes me feel patriotic."
Bill Maher,,"The House okayed the gasoline tax cut, which will increase the deficit, line the pockets of the oil companies, and hurt the environment; Dole said that if there was just some way this could interfere with people's sex lives, it would be perfect legislation."
Bill Maher,,"If you're keeping score at home, they have now applauded executions at the Republican debate, they have cheered letting an uninsured man die, and they booed an active duty U.S. serviceman for being gay. I don’t know how you get to the right with this crowd but Ron Paul’s new campaign ad is just the Rodney King beating to the sound of children laughing."
Bill Maher,,"The jury could get the case as early as next week, but the defense says they just want to introduce one last-minute load of crap."
Bill Maher,"importance,cancer","I think America causes cancer, longevity is less important than fun, and young people should be discouraged from voting."
Bill Maher,,"I have such disdain for anybody who gets joy out of blowing the stuffing out of a little woodland creature, that I don't really care if any of them gets shot."
Bill Maher,,Nobody sees people as people. It's all how they relate to my little group.
Bill Maher,,"Amazon has included me in an opportunity to provide top-shelf television-style programming live on the world's computer screens. To hold forth with the industry's very best actors, directors, musicians, authors - I'm thrilled to be on the cutting edge of this."
Bill Maher,attitude,"Well, that's exactly the wrong attitude. That is not the attitude they had in World War II. Your attitude is that freedom means you can do whatever you want whenever you want it, and that sacrifice is somehow un-American. But the idea that we should also be defensive about our flaws and weaknesses and our vulnerabilities is ridiculous."
Bill Maher,pope,"If you have a few hundred followers and you let some of them molest children, they call you a cult leader. If you have a billion, they call you Pope."
Bill Maher,,"I want to always be an interloper. I never want to feel like I'm a guy who is embraced by the people who are putting me on the air. I want to feel like I broke into the studio and took over and made them mad. If I'm not doing that, I'm not doing my job."
Bill Maher,,This has been a learning experience for me. I also thought that privacy was something we were granted in the Constitution. I have learned from this when in fact the word privacy does not appear in the Constitution.
Bill Maher,,"Did you hear this – Sarah Palin finally heard what happened in Japan and she’s demanding that we invade Tsunami. I mean she said, ""These Tsunamians will not get away with this"". Oh speaking of dumb twats, did you..."
Bill Maher,,"What Democratic congressmen do to their women staffers, Republican congressmen do to the country."
Bill Maher,men,Men are only as loyal as their options.
Bill Maher,,"When you want to make it clear to the rest of the world that you are not an imperialist, the best countries to have with you are Britain and Spain."
Bill Maher,,I do think the patriotic thing to do is to critique my country. How else do you make a country better but by pointing out its flaws?
Bill Maher,,"Bush gave an interview and he said people will vote for him because ""They've seen me weep, they’ve seen me laugh, and they’ve seen me hug."" These are the same qualifications for a Tickle Me Elmo."
Bill Maher,,"We have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, it's not cowardly."
Bill Maher,,"Things aren't right. If a burglar breaks into your home and you shoot him, he can sue you. For what, restraint of trade?"
Bill Maher,hitler,Saddam Hussein is Hitler like Oasis was The Beatles.
Bill Maher,religion,"What I have against religion is that they start you when you are so defenseless. I mean, I was three when they started pumping this bullshit into my head. I believed in Santa Claus and the Fairy Godmother, of course I believed in a virgin birth, and a guy lived in a whale, and a woman came from a rib. But then something happened that made me doubt all of it: I graduated sixth grade!"
Bill Maher,sex,"The cable TV sex channels don't expand our horizons, don't make us better people and don't come in clearly enough."
Bill Maher,9/11,But isn't there something wrong when I'm the only guy in the country that got fired for 9/11?
Bill Maher,"religion,politics,violence","If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence, and sheer ignorance as religion is, youd resign in protest. To do otherwise is to be an enabler - a mafia wife."
Bill Maher,problems,"When we talk about values, I think of rationality in solving problems. That’s something I value. Fairness, kindness, generosity, tolerance. When they talk about values, they’re talking about things like going to church, voting for Bush, being loyal to Jesus, praying. These are not values."
Bill Maher,pope,"Since the Icelandic volcano obviously needs a virgin sacrifice and the Catholic Church obviously needs new leadership the Pope must volunteer to jump in the volcano. Pontiff, don't think of it as endorsing paganism, think of it as supersizing Ash Wednesday."
Bill Maher,,"Please stop assuming that longevity and perfect health is always the correct option. No. Sometimes fun costs ya. It just does, you know? And that's OK, you're willing to make that purchase. Sammy Davis, Jr. was 64 when he died. Give me 64 Sammy-years, I'll be happy."
Bill Maher,"dinosaurs,museums","I was just at the newly opened Creationist Museum in Kentucky.... And they have this exhibit of a giant dinosaur...with a saddle on its back. Because the world is only 5000 years old, so man and the dinosaurs had to coexist, and, of course, we rode them. A theory I thought laughable at the age of eight when I saw it on the Flintstones!"
Bill Maher,,"Suicide is man's way of telling God, ""You can't fire me - I quit!"""
Bill Maher,,"George Bush says, ""Gore's book needs a lot of explaining."" Of course, Bush says that about every book."
Bill Maher,problems,The problem is that the people with the most ridiculous ideas are always the people who are most certain of them.
Bill Maher,religion,I love Jesus. I just don’t like the Christians who don’t believe in what he says.
Bill Maher,,"I think we need to change that old saying, ""I don't need a building to fall on me."" Because two did and we still don't get it. I think we all stick our head in the sand as a deep human impulse."
Bill Maher,government,"Government - they used to teach it in college. It's actually something you should study and learn and know how to do. The Republicans always run on the idea that government isn't very effective. Well, not the way you do it. But it can be effective."
Bill Maher,,"If I thought the Lord was speaking to me I'd check myself into Bellevue, and I think you should too."
Bill Maher,,"We don't like mystery. You like mystery, 'cause it's not a mystery to you; you know when you're gonna get laid."
Bill Maher,"decisions,gays","The thing I don't understand about homosexuals is, how do they decide which one is the one who's supposed to pretend they don't want it?"
Bill Maher,,"The comedy gods are smiling on me tonight, because for the longest time, I have said that president Bush must set a timetable for removing his head from his ass... and, by god, last week they went in and looked for it. They didn't find it, so now we don't know where it is, but at least for once in my life, I get to see the words ""Bush"", ""operation"", and ""successful"" in the same sentence."
Bill Maher,"honesty,politics","Just honest. To me, being 'politically incorrect' means the opposite of being political - which means to spin everything. That's all it's ever meant to me. It's never meant liberal or conservative. It means honest."
Bill Maher,intelligence,"If we stopped calling it profiling and started calling it ""proactive intelligence screening"" or ""high alert detecting"", people would be saying ""Well, it's about time""."
Bill Maher,,"You know, if you're an American and you're born at this time in history especially, you're lucky. We all are. We won the world history Powerball lottery."
Bill Maher,,"Now, I'm no doctor, but I am on TV. And in my professional opinion, George Bush is a paranoid schizophrenic."
Bill Maher,madonna,"A new biography of Madonna came out last week, and apparently the biography lists all the men she's slept with. The book is apparently called the Manhattan Telephone Directory."
Bill Maher,,"And for the record, all marriages are same sex marriages. You get married, and every night, it's the same sex."
Bill Maher,"smoking,madonna","They're talking about banning cigarette smoking now in any place that's used by ten or more people in a week, which, I guess, means that Madonna can't even smoke in bed."
Bill Maher,dating,The whole dating ritual was different when I was a kid. Girls got pinned - not nailed.
Bill Maher,,Cornbread isn't bread. It's cake.
Bill Maher,politics,"Freedom isn't free. It shouldn't be a bragging point that ""Oh, I don't get involved in politics"", as if that makes you somehow cleaner. No, that makes you derelict of duty in a republic. Liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didn't insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable."
Bill Maher,,Kids. They're not easy. But there has to be some penalty for sex.
Bill Maher,"religion,questions,attitude","The only appropriate attitude for man to have about the big questions, is not the arrogant certitude that is the hallmark of religion, but doubt. Doubt is humble and that is what man needs to be, considering that human history is just a litany of getting shit dead wrong."
Bill Maher,drugs,"You can't lie to kids about drugs. They know about drugs. You can't say they're just all bad. They know life is a little more complicated. I have never done heroin. I would never recommend heroin, but it hasn't hurt my record collection."
Bill Maher,"drugs,religion",I think religion is bad and drugs are good.
Bill Maher,"gays,new york,football","In New York now, they have Harvey Milk High School for gay students. They don't have much of a football team, but the half-time show..."
Bill Maher,,"If you think you have it tough, read history books."
Bill Maher,"gays,laws,birthday","Let's make a law that gay people can have birthdays, but straight people get more cake - you know, to send the right message to kids."
Bill Maher,complaints,Women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them.
Bill Maher,,That's what's so great about the Internet. It allows pompous blow-hards to connect with other pompous blow-hards in a vast circle-jerk of pomposity.
Bill Maher,,Can we go back to using Facebook for what it was originally for - looking up exes to see how fat they got?
Bill Maher,,"Saying someone is religious is heard in most of America as a compliment, a reassuring affirmation that someone will be moral, ethical, and after a few glasses of wine, a freak in the bedroom."
Bill Maher,,"Be out of the mainstream. I'm out of the mainstream. I enjoy it, who wants to be in the mainstream?"
Bill Maher,bible,The Bible looks like it started out as a game of mad libs.
Bill Maher,violence,Maybe every other American movie shouldn't be based on a comic book. Other countries will think Americans live in an infantile fantasy land where reality is whatever we say it is and every problem can be solved with violence.
Bill Maher,,Let's face it; God has a big ego problem. Why do we always have to worship him?
Bill Maher,"hate,racism,tea",The tea baggers. The one thing they hate is when you call them racist. The other thing they hate is black people. But they won't say it.
Bill Maher,religion,"Whenever you combine a secretive compound, religion, and weirdos in pioneer outfits, there's gonna be some child fucking going on."
Bill Maher,,I'm staying in a strange hotel. I called room service for a sandwich and they sent up two hookers.

Bill Maher,,"Isn't Bush the worst president ever? I mean, when his term is over, he has to walk back to Texas."

Bill Maher,"society,terrorists","So when I say we had been the cowards, yes, that's what I meant, we as a society. And that's everybody, including myself.

Bill Maher,"art,new york","In New York, Catholic groups have forced an art gallery to shut down an exhibition of a six-foot image of Jesus in chocolate. So, the Archbishop of New York was very upset. He said, “It is appalling to make Jesus out of food! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go bake some communion wafers.”"
Bill Maher,rain,"If churches don't have to pay taxes, they also can't call the fire department when they catch fire. Sorry reverend, that's one of those services that goes along with paying in. I'll use the fire department I pay for. You can pray for rain."
Bill Maher,,"Mr. President, there are some people who are never going to like you. That's why they voted for the old guy and Carrie's mom. You're not going to win them over. Stand up for the 70% of Americans who aren't crazy."
Bill Maher,9/11,It's not a mystery to me what happened with 9/11. These guys are out there. We knew they were out there. It was a failure of will on our part to address the situation 10 years before. There is no big mystery about it.
Bill Maher,terrorists,"I mean, maybe one day we will live in a more optimum world where terrorists come in every color of the rainbow. But the truth is, now they don't. I mean, the people who are trying to get us are young Muslim men, period."

Bill Maher,motivation,If you believe that the world is going to come to an end - and perhaps any day now - does it not drain one's motivation to improve life on earth while we're here?
Bill Maher,jail,"Rush Limbaugh, who has made a career preaching that anybody who does drugs has got to go right to jail - do not pass go, no questions asked, right to jail - gets caught doing thirty oxycontin a day. Thirty oxycontin?! Do you have any idea how high that is?! I don't, and I've been pretty high!"
Bill Maher,white house,Clinton left the White House with all the class of an XFL halftime show.
Bill Maher,,"You can’t be a rational person six days a week and on one day of the week, go to a building, and think you are drinking the blood of a two thousand year old space god. That doesn’t make you a person of faith, that makes you a schizophrenic."
Bill Maher,dogs,"But I’ve often said that if I had - I have two dogs - if I had two retarded children, I’d be a hero. And yet the dogs, which are pretty much the same thing. What? They’re sweet. They’re loving. They’re kind, but they don’t mentally advance at all. Dogs are like retarded children."
Bill Maher,,"To those people who say, ""My father is alive because of animal experimentation"", I say ""Yeah, well, good for you. This dog died so your father could live."" Sorry, but I am just not behind that kind of trade off."
Bill Maher,,"I always compare marriage to communism. They're both institutions that don't conform to human nature, so you're going to end up with lying and hypocrisy."
Bill Maher,,"I know a whole generation has been raised on the notion of multiculturalism; that all civilizations are just different. No! Not always. Sometimes things are better! Rule of law is better than autocracy and theocracy; equality of the sexes, better; protection of minorities, better; free speech, better; free elections, better; free appliances with large purchases, better! Don't get so tolerant that you tolerate intolerance."
Bill Maher,,I don't want to be a pessimist. I'm a realist. One man's realist is another man's pessimist.

Bill Maher,obama,"There's a word the teabaggers have wanted to use since Obama came on the scene, but they can't because it's not the 1950s. They would love to say this word. It begins with an N and ends with -er, and it's not ""nation-builder""."
Bill Maher,,"I kid the Republicans, with love. I feel bad for them. They got nobody for next time. Who are they gonna run? Sara Palin, reading off her hand. Did you see that? You saw this? She wrote ""tax cuts"" on her hand. A Republican so stupid she has to be reminded of the one thing– Tax cuts! This is like if you saw the coyote's paw and it said ""Road Runner""."
Bill Maher,toasters,"They keep pushing the idea, ""The only reliable way to prevent pregnancy is to not have sex at all, because, condoms? Ooh, very unreliable, condoms break all the time."" Okay. I've been using these things for thirty-five years. I've never had one break. Either I'm the luckiest son-of-a-bitch who ever lived - and I'm not - or this is the most reliable invention since the toaster."
Bill Maher,white people,I want to see riots! I want to see the kind of riots where cab drivers are afraid to pick up white people! I want to see this guy!

Bill Maher,,"I'm supposed to be all re-injected with yes-we-can fever after the big health care speech, and it was a great speech - when Black Elvis gets jiggy with his teleprompter, there is none better. But here's the thing: Muhammad Ali also had a way with words, but it helped enormously that he could also punch guys in the face."
Bill Maher,"questions,respect","President Bush never really has to answer a question. Nobody ever says to him, ""With due respect, sir, your answer had absolutely nothing to do with the question I asked."""
Bill Maher,government,"Republicans are always saying we should privatize things like schools, prisons, social security - hey, how about we privatize privacy! Because if the government forbids gay men from tying the knot, what is their alternative? They can`t all marry Liza Minnelli."
Bill Maher,danger,"We're always on a tightrope. We're trying to put together people who don't make sense to be together, talking about issues that are sensitive and controversial. We're mixing dangerous chemicals on a nightly basis."
Bill Maher,,I like groaning. That means that you're not pandering to their already settled prejudices.
Bill Maher,,"On the show, I do a very serious thing. And a lot of people have a hard time reconciling that with what I'm going to do after the show. They can't get it into their heads: ""How can he be talking to Madeleine Albright one minute and then somebody half his age...."" They're just jealous. But I never made any bones about it. I am a player. Always have been."
Bill Maher,television,"I don't want my president to be a TV star. You don't have to be on television every minute of every day - you're the president, not a rerun of ""Law & Order"". TV stars are too worried bout being popular and too concerned about being renewed."
Bill Maher,religion,I would describe my spirituality as exactly the opposite of having a religious affiliation.

Bill Maher,,"If Jesus was a Jew, why did he have a Spanish name?"
Bill Maher,,"Only cowards push a button from thousands of miles away, or tens of thousands of feet up, to kill people who can't possibly fight back."
Bill Maher,religion,"Rational people, anti-religionists, must end their timidity and come out of the closet and assert themselves. And those who consider themselves only moderately religious really need to look in the mirror and realize that the solace and comfort that religion brings you actually comes at a terrible price."
Bill Maher,religion,That's religion. You pray. You bow. You kneel. You fast. You trim the balls of a giant space penis.

Billy Connolly,,I don't understand art-speak. My pictures are big doodles. I'm amazed what people come up with when they look at them. There's one of a figure with two heads that somebody thought must be a comment on the state of matrimony. None of it is a comment on anything.
Billy Connolly,,"Who discovered we could get milk from cows, and what did he think he was doing at the time?"
Billy Connolly,,I have been made redundant before and it is a terrible blow; redundant is a rotten word because it makes you think you are useless.

Billy Connolly,,"There's nothing like it, but it's not as good as you think it's going to be... I was disappointed because there are records of people finding things that have been there for years. I was hoping for a shirt button, or my club's badge - but not a sausage."
Billy Connolly,"men,women,sex","The human race has been set up. Someone, somewhere, is playing a practical joke on us. Apparently, women need to feel loved to have sex. Men need to have sex to feel loved. How do we ever get started?"

Billy Connolly,,"It seems to me that Islam and Christianity and Judaism all have the same god, and he's telling them all different things."
Billy Connolly,"differences,friends,audience",I've always been fascinated by the difference between the jokes you can tell your friends but you can't tell to an audience. There's a fine line you have to tread because you don't know who is out there in the auditorium. A lot of people are too easily offended.

Billy Connolly,"success,driving","Once you become successful, people know where you live, the type of house you live in, the kind of car you drive, the clothes you wear, and so it would be patronising to go and talk like a welder. Welding's a mystery to me now. You can't go back, your life changes every day."
Billy Connolly,success,"As soon as I got successful, the Scottish press started picking on me. It's something they reserve just for me."

Billy Connolly,,"People who point at their wrist while asking for the time... I know where my watch is pal, where the fuck is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is?"

Billy Connolly,,"And we took off-whoosh-into the night. Through the clouds, we hurtled up into the sky. And this man farted. I will never forget it as long as I live.

If Christians did that, I would believe them. ""what? The bastards killed Jesus!"""
Billy Connolly,"comedians,complaints","It's very awkward to be kind of big in your own field. It limits what you're offered. People are swayed by the fact that you're a comedian or a musician or whatever they think you are. When it comes to choosing you, they get a bit shaky about offering you a different type of role.

Bob Hope,,I thought 'Deep Throat' was a movie about a giraffe.

Bob Newhart,emotions,Women are more emotional. They do get flustered. Which is not to say that men are better than they. It's simply the way it is.
Bob Newhart,,"You may not think I'm a sex symbol, but I became a father at the age of 48. Now young people think of me as a mini-folk hero because it's difficult for them to believe a man of my age is sexually active."
Bob Newhart,"intelligence,audience","We presumed a certain intelligence on the audience, that they knew something about Sir Walter Raleigh, or about Abraham Lincoln, or the Wright Brothers."
Bob Newhart,,"Stammering is different than stuttering. Stutterers have trouble with the letters, while stammerers trip over entire parts of a sentence.

My own private theory is that stammerers have so many ideas swirling around their brains at once that they can't get them all out, though I haven't found any scientific evidence to back that up."
Bob Newhart,,"The reason I'm a psychologist is based in part on my telephone routines. Much of my humor comes out of reaction to what other people are saying. A psychologist is a man who listens, who is sympathetic."

Bob Newhart,,"I still feel 30, except when I try to run."
Bob Newhart,brain,"Marriage and fatherhood heighten the disillusion that we all think we are born handy. We confidently believe that we can fix things around the house, as if it's part of the collective brain that was further enhanced by eighth-grade shop class."
Bob Newhart,patients,"My theory is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I tried to capitalized on the values that made the show work. I have to be nice to my guests at the hotel, as I had to do with my patients, even when they're bugging me. And the home-life part seemed to work. I don't want ever to ride the show into the ground. It has been good to me."
Bob Newhart,challenges,Continuing to do stand-up is always a challenge because the audiences and the environments in which you work very often differ.
Bob Newhart,,"I never had an aversion because I was active in the drama club. If I had that aversion I certainly wouldn't put myself in the position of being on stage. Of course, in the drama club you're hiding behind a character."
Bob Newhart,"alcohol,airports","I'm one of those passengers who arrives at the airport five or six hours early so I can throw back a few drinks and muster up the courage to board the plane. Apparently I'm not alone because I've never been in an empty airport bar. I don't care what time you get there. Even at 8:00 a.m. you have to fight your way to the bar. At that hour, everyone drinks Bloody Marys so no one can tell it's booze- at least until they fall off their chair."

Bob Newhart,,"I don't have a show anymore. I don't have a check coming in every week. This is important to me, I got to score a million tonight or it could all be over."

Bob Newhart,market,"Television series are like the stock market. There's room for bears and bulls but no room for pigs. If we'd tried to milk another year out of the series, we'd have wound up with a pig."
Bob Newhart,,"The fact they're not there anymore is not a reflection on the actors. It's just that viewers didn't like it. You went, 'What the hell was that?'"
Bob Newhart,gays,"The problem is that we live in an uptight country. Why don't we just laugh at ourselves? We are funny. Gays are funny. Straights are funny. Women are funny. Men are funny. We are all funny, and we all do funny things. Let's laugh about it."
Bob Newhart,,"There are a lot of questions I keep asking myself about why I do comedy. I guess I laugh to keep from crying. And I guess if you ever get me crying, I might not stop. This is the way I look at tragedy or else I'll cry."
Bob Newhart,,"When you're going for a joke, you're stuck out there if it doesn't work. There's nowhere to go. You've done the drum role and the cymbal clash and you're out on the end of the plank."
Bob Newhart,,"When I started out in 1960, I thought it might possibly last a couple of years. I never expected it to last 42. I take great satisfaction in that longevity."
Bob Newhart,,Well I was much too practical to presume to have a career in comedy.
Bob Newhart,,The only thing I have never done is a Broadway play. I'm not sure I have the discipline necessary to do a Broadway play. I know it holds a fascination for certain actors.

Bob Newhart,,I'm very open to the up-and-comers.
Bob Newhart,,"I'm most proud of the longevity of my marriage, my kids, and my grandchildren. If you don't have that, you really don't have very much."

Bob Newhart,success,I think one reason for a successful marriage is laughter. I think laughter gets you through the rough moments in a marriage.

Bob Newhart,,Don't be silly and don't waste your time.

Bob Newhart,nowdays,I don't know how many sacred cows there are today. I think there's a little confusion between humor and gross passing for humor. That's kind of regrettable.
Bob Newhart,,"Jack Benny was, without a doubt, the bravest comedian I have ever seen work. He wasn't afraid of silence. He would take as long as it took to tell the story."
Bob Newhart,,I wouldn't want that man as my psychologist.
Bob Newhart,family,I think there are still words you can't use in family entertainment that you can use in a sitcom today.
Bob Newhart,comedians,"One of the first things that you learn as a stand-up is, you're the boss. It's your stage, and don't screw with me because I'll make you look bad, which I had to do, because you wind up with drunks and loud people."
Bob Newhart,,Funny is funny is funny.
Bob Newhart,,"I was not influenced by Jack Benny, and people have remarked on my timing and Jack's timing, but I don't think you can teach timing. It's something you hear in your head."

Bob Newhart,,I am a minimalist. I like saying the most with the least.

There was the point was I talk to myself to you, every screw up nature, look at what you've done with your life. But there was always something on the horizon, that was holding, maybe, you know, this will make you different."
Bob Newhart,christmas,"There's a lot of cynicism. Let's really enjoy Christmas, with all that's going on in the world."

That's who it was made for. They loved it. And if they loved it, great. Why the hell does a fifty-year-old guy working at a big newspaper have to tell me I'm a piece of crap?"

Bob Saget,decisions,"What I have now are good problems of trying to decide and what I really want to do is good work next. My phone's ringing a lot more and I've got nine lines so when it doesn't ring, it's very frustrating."
Bob Saget,,"I think Desperate Housewives is a pretty good show, I watch it, I like it and I don't love reality tv that much. I do watch some, I've got three daughters so we'll watch the good stuff, the fun stuff."
Bob Saget,,"It was a job; the video show was a job; you don't tell the Aristocrats joke at 8 o'clock at night on network tv, it would be funny though. But those guys know I like dirty stuff, I like clean stuff too."
Bob Saget,,"Yet there are some people - Steve Allen would dissect comedy forever; he's a really funny guy, but he would love talking about comedy. I'm doing it right now and you all seem bored."
Bob Saget,,"You can cauterize your asshole shut, you understand me? And then when you fart, it has nowhere to go. I'm not fuckin' around, it goes into your body and into your heart and you have a fart attack, is what you have. And you will die from that, and your last breath will be a burp and it will smell like shit."
Bob Saget,,"Because I am a fuckin' genius... according to my gynecologist, who said ""That clitoris is gigantic."""

Bob Saget,,"Jared, don't fuck a goat. You hear me, son? Because a goat - no, listen. No, fuckin' listen. Put it on receive, dude. A goat... why am I attacking you? I have no idea. It's a mode of choice. But a goat will eat a tin can, they'll eat fuckin' junk. They'll chew it up. Have you ever watched 'em? They eat shit. And they will eat your junk right off, Jared. And you will be junkless. And you will have nothing, you'll have like a tit - a tin plate, where your - a tit plate. You'll have a nipple where your dick was, and you will be fucked."

Bob Saget,,"What I've learned about comedy people is that they're defined by the harshest level they've been to, their personal Auschwitz."
Bob Saget,,"Some people say kissing is more intimate than sex... I guess, if you’re kissing someone’s butt hole."
Bob Saget,,"John and I were gay together once... Wait, that's not true. He was gay and I just laid there. Thank you, John, for giving me your heiny last night."
Bob Saget,,"If you laugh at that, you lower the bar, and I will limbo under it because I am a fucked-up guy!"

Bob Saget,new york,"I've had a pilot every single year that didn't sell for the past four years, that'll smack you in the back of the head. I had a really good one last year; I wouldn't have done the play in New York if I had gotten that one."
Bob Saget,,People do what they do to each other and they feed on it.
Bob Saget,,And turkeys are a bird. A very nervous bird. You’d be nervous too if you knew that one day you’d get your head cut off and... filled with stuffing.
Bob Saget,,"Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. I assumed you were a guy, you might have female parts. I don't know per-say. And I don't mean to call it a per-say, but it might be... with sack."
Bob Saget,politics,Concerned we're in a time where politicians can't even fake sincerity. Aren't they supposed to be good at that?
Bob Saget,,"The other day my twelve-year-old says to me, ""I don't feel like I'm with you right now. You're in the car with me, you're checking your e-mail, you're not listening to me, I don't feel like I'm with you."" And I say, ""You know what? That was your mother's gripe, too. And she was right. And you're also correct."" When you cop to something, you get to the next level. In this case, the next level is: I just learned something from my twelve-year-old."
Bob Saget,,"If you go with Marshall McLuhan's theory that the medium is the message, as soon as you're hosting a blooper show, you're done."

Bob Saget,"new york,privileges",I just did a play in New York which has been my best experience that I've had for maybe ever. It was Paul Weitz's play called Privilege and I was in New York for three months.
Bob Saget,,They say the measure of a man is judged by the company he keeps. I'm fucked.
Bob Saget,,"Stop It, stop lighting your butthol on fire, and everybody listen to me. If you light your ass on fire, I hope you have boxers or a filter of somekind, because if your a bareass person. Not a lot of people have done this. Stop It. This is why. You can cauterize your asshole shut, so when you fart it has nowhere to go and you can have a fart attack."
Bob Saget,,Friend of mine just told me he used to be a bad alcoholic. I calmed him down. Told him he was a good alcoholic just a horrible drinker.

Bob Saget,,"Paul Riser tells it in an interesting way; he dissects it and tells the structure, you know, 'you don't mention that part here.' But that's what's interesting about it and the people who are absent are interesting too."
Bob Saget,,"So, fuck that shit. That's... eww. Who came up with that? ""Fuck that shit."" No thanks, I'm good. Do not - Kids, don't fuck that shit. You'll get an infection. You listen to me, I'm a doctor and a pharmacist and a 9-1-1 operator. I know what the fuck I'm doing. Don't fuck that shit. That would be a good public service announcement for Nickelodeon. ""Hi, this is Bob Saget. Don't fuck that shit. Stay in school. And read."""
Bob Saget,,"A lot of the comedians don't even tell the joke. Like only three tell the joke, the rest of them dissect it."
Bob Saget,,I can't go back now. I've done it. I've gone and done it.
Bob Saget,,I love telling stories and acting and entertaining people. I don't want to make fun of people.
Bob Saget,,My favorite Dylan song? I think it's 'Just Like a Woman.' It always makes me cry.
Bob Saget,,"I'm fortunate to know a lot of incredibly talented people, and they all want to be a penguin."
Bob Saget,intelligence,"You can talk about things indirectly, but if you want to talk how people really talk, you have to talk R-rated. I mean I've got three incredibly intelligent daughters, but when you get mad, you get mad and you talk like people talk. When a normal 17-year-old girl storms out of the house or 15-year-old boy is mad at his mom or dad, they're not talking the way people talk on TV. Unless it's cable."
Bob Saget,,Words matter. Especially ones with four letters.
Bobby Slayton,,"You know who doesn't get the death penalty? Crazy people. That’s a defense in America. ""My client’s crazy. He doesn’t know what he did."" Fine, then he doesn't know we’re gonna kill him. If a guy's that retard, you put him the electric chair and tell him it’s a ride."
Bobby Slayton,people,"If you can't laugh at yourself, make fun of other people."
Bobby Slayton,boxing,"A lot of these kids have no fathers, and they want to be gangsters. They don't believe in God and have no faith in anything but their own instincts. Boxing provides a way for them to express themselves in a positive way, and I'm happy to be able to help them."
Bobby Slayton,"drugs,advertising,brain","I don’t get the point of drug commercials. Like the thing with the frying pan and the egg. “This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?” Yeah, do I get bacon with this?"
Bobby Slayton,,"We have blacks and whites, Jews and Arabs, Serbs and Croats, and Filipinos and Vietnamese here. At the end of the day, everyone is each other's brother."
Bobby Slayton,audience,"I had a porn star in the audience the other night, and she really doesn’t like performing sex scenes. She says, “I fake my orgasms. I can’t wait for this to get off me. And all I can think about is getting paid and having dinner later.” I said, “Wow! I’m married to a porn star!”"
Bobby Slayton,,Women don’t have dicks and they don’t want dicks. That amateur psychology crap that women want penises. And they certainly don’t want testicles. Because you know no women in her right mind is going to carry around a bag that she can’t put stuff in.
Bobby Slayton,,I offend everybody.
Bobcat Goldthwait,,"For a day and a half, the National Guard was here, and they didn't go to work. Do you remember why? No bullets. I found it really hard to believe that that was the same crackerjack unit that Dan Quayle once belonged to."
Bobcat Goldthwait,,"If you ever see me at a boat show or at a car show, blow my head off."
Bobcat Goldthwait,,"Don't hoo, hoo, hoo me. There's a fine line between hoo, hoo, hoo and hiel, hiel, hiel."
Bobcat Goldthwait,parents,"Fame is like a big eraser. It's strange, now that I'm famous. In my parents' opinion, all the shitty things - all the wreckage of my past - is erased. Now it's like I was never the kid who got arrested. Now I'm a wonderful son."
Bobcat Goldthwait,,"That movie looks so bad, I can't believe I wasn't in it."
Bobcat Goldthwait,,They can't even put the name in TV Guide.
Bobcat Goldthwait,babies,When I was a baby I had no teeth. I couldn't get a job and I couldn't eat meat.
Bobcat Goldthwait,,I retired from acting the same time they stopped hiring me. But following my own thing of making these small indie movies has been the happiest I've ever been.
Bobcat Goldthwait,,You can't blame the President for everything that's wrong with this country. That's like blaming Ronald McDonald if you get a bad cheeseburger.
Bobcat Goldthwait,"police,help","If you ever see me getting beaten by the police, put down the video camera and come help me!"
Bobcat Goldthwait,,America is one of the finest countries anyone ever stole.
Bobcat Goldthwait,differences,"Well, I’m an uncle now ... don’t know if I’m a good one. My nephew asked me the difference between a hamster and a gerbil and I told him I thought there was more dark meat on a gerbil."
Bobcat Goldthwait,baseball,"I think there are only three things America will be known for 2,000 years from now when they study this civilization: the Constitution, jazz music, and baseball."
Bobcat Goldthwait,,"I'm against gun control. It's not that I like guns, it's just that allowing Americans to have guns will increase the chances that a bunch of rednecks will blow each other's heads off."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"When I first started doing stand-up, I would be so nervous that I would just binge drink really heavily right before my sets, and as you can imagine, that had its drawbacks. But now I'm a professional, so I pace myself throughout the day."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"I jog, actually; I go at night. A lot of women, they don't like to go jogging alone at night. They're afraid they might get accosted. I go naked. That way, if there are any perverts around, they think I'm already being chased."
Bonnie McFarlane,babies,Babies: they're not just for Puerto Ricans anymore.
Bonnie McFarlane,,"Intellectually, I think everyone really knows that women are funny, but it’s a weird thing that people keep trotting out."
Bonnie McFarlane,,Well I grew up in Canada in a really small town. We didn't have running water for a long time and we didn't have TV. Then when we did get TV we only had one channel.
Bonnie McFarlane,,"I’ve always wanted to be a writer. Always been very creative. I always laughed at things that the rest of my family would sort of get angry, like not understand."
Bonnie McFarlane,police,"I don’t think cops should wear mirrored sunglasses; the whole time the guy was chewing me out, all I could think was ""I should cut my bangs."""
Bonnie McFarlane,,"One of my favorite sketches, and a popular comedy formula, is to put someone with a mental handicap in some kind of unlikely situation. For example: The retarded gynecologist, the retarded Jesus, the retarded Osama Bin Laden. It works. It's funny. Inappropriate? I dunno. I feel like I'm a pretty good judge of what crosses the line of good taste being that I am retarded. Socially perhaps, but severly retarded."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"I think it’s creepy if a guy says, ""I would never hit a girl."" Cause that should go without saying. That’s like if you ever heard a guy go, ""I would never crap in a hot tub."""
Bonnie McFarlane,,"When you’re pregnant, people feel like they can come up and give you unsolicited advice. When I was nine months pregnant, this one woman came up and she said, ""I have one word for you: epidural."" And I was like, ""Oh my God, thanks. But we already picked a name."""
Bonnie McFarlane,,I saw the head of NOW - National Organization of Women - saying that women still only make 70 cents on the dollar to every man. I’m not sure I’m going to believe that. Women are notoriously bad at math.
Bonnie McFarlane,,"My neighbor says being gay is biological. And the reason she gives is she says, “I knew I was gay since I was five years old.” Five. I don’t know about you, but when I was five, I’d fuck a guy, fuck a girl, fuck a guy, fuck a girl. I was all over the map. I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. I didn’t figure that out until I was nine."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"I know environmentalists exist, but whenever I see a guy on a bike, I don't think, 'Oh, sweet, there goes an environmentalist.' I'm always like, 'That poor sucker got a DUI.'"
Bonnie McFarlane,"importance,embarrassment",Is being earnest important? I always think it's kind of embarrassing.
Bonnie McFarlane,,"Never hit a baby, even if they start it."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"If you really are superior, you don't go around saying you're superior - unless you're Jewish."
Bonnie McFarlane,racism,"Such a politically correct time. I used to do a lot of racial material, but then people would think I was a racist and I'm not - anymore."
Bonnie McFarlane,husband,I guess the biggest issue my husband and I are going to have is how do we raise the baby… because he’s Jewish and I’m Protestant and the baby’s father is Catholic.
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"As for that word... Retard. I tried to get my sister to start calling her friends retard, you know, to take the word back. Own the power. They could be like, ""Yo, Tardo!"" ""Hey, Retard, what up?"" to one another. But if a non-retarded person said it, they'd get pissed, ""No, thas our word!"" But it's a complicated game of irony and my sister doesn't play that shit. She refuses to use the word retard for fear she might hurt someone's feelings. Me, I'm not so nice."
Bonnie McFarlane,hollywood,"When I first got into this biz called show, I decided I was going to change my name, make it more Hollywood. And you know how you do that? You take your middle name and the first street that you ever lived on. So when I first started, I actually went by Sue Rural Route 2."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"I got a new diaphragm - well, it's new to me."
Bonnie McFarlane,,I could never be a lesbian because I have a really good sense of humor.
Bonnie McFarlane,cocaine,"Cocaine is yucky. I did it once: I was at a party; I was bored. I was like, 'Alright, I'll do a line.' Then I was just bored longer."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"Sometimes when I’m bored, I like to people watch. And I got to a touristy area and I play this game I just made up. I call it ""Lesbian or Midwestern?"""
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"My sister might be dumb, but that doesn't make her all that different from the rest of us. She's just like any other American. Except she's Canadian. And retarded."
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"My sister loves dirty comedy. She'll laugh hysterically at every foul word, every titillating premise, every fart noise and every faggot impression. It will come as no surprise then, when I tell you that her favorite comic is Janeane Garofalo. She thinks she's really cool. Her favorite movie moment of all time is that scene in ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" when Janeane's character, on roller skates, is pulled down the street by a couple of dogs. Regardless of where you are on the whole alternative comedy debate, you gotta admit, that shit was funny."
Bonnie McFarlane,"mexicans,racism","I've been called a racist before, and let me tell you something - that is harsh. That's a really ugly thing to call someone. That's like being called a Mexican."
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"Another time we watched this morose, spiky-haired open miker do his entire set laying down on the stage. I guess it was his way of saying, ""Fuck standup."" From his supine position he mostly did dumb puns. After a couple of minutes my sister turned to me and threw her hands in the air, ""I don't get it!"""
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"Once my sister busted a nut watching a headliner I worked with. He closed his set by miming the insertion of a tampon up his asshole. I don't recall the exact joke. After his set my sister made a beeline for him, running roughshod over the other more delicate comedy groupies. She gushed about his tampon bit and then told him he should get an actual tampon and really stick it up there. And then she laughed like crazy. I thought it was a good note."
Bonnie McFarlane,audience,"I still don't really know what my style is. I like a lot of different kinds of comedy, I like watching it and I like being inventive and original. That's the problem with doing a longer set - you can't do every joke that you have because some stuff contradicts other stuff. Even when you know that the audience knows that you're joking and it's not true, you still can't do a joke about your family dying and then later talk about your Mom. I mean you want to keep some kind of cohesive order going."
Bonnie McFarlane,,There's no such thing as a feminist - just women who pay for their own breast implants.
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"It's interesting, once I have convinced people that, yes, I have a sister with a mental disability, the retard jokes really dry up, so I'm not sure how much retard humor is really going on out there, but I imagine there's a lot because it's a pretty safe group to make fun of. It's not like the Retards of America are gonna rise up and organize a protest. They're not gonna write letters. They only just recently got the Supreme Court to stop executing them."
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"My sister would've liked to have been a comic. She had an act that she would do for me sometimes. But of course, she didn't become a standup comedian because she's kind of a big talker. Doesn't do a whole lot of the things she says she will. Like go to the moon. The truth is if she had done it, she would be so fucking famous right now. Her act was simply a stream of obscenities and giggling. Can you imagine? A retarded chick just standing on stage swearing and giggling?"
Bonnie McFarlane,dogs,I love my hunting dog. I loved my hunting dog - I'm not very good at hunting.
Bonnie McFarlane,,"If you enjoy shaming people, I suggest dentistry as a profession."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"I get called ""sweetheart"" a lot by guys. You know a lot of women take offense at that, but when you've been called ""cunt"" enough times, it kind of takes the sting out of ""sweetheart""."
Bonnie McFarlane,,"Just a tip if you have a big event to go to or an important meeting, if you cry enough your face swells up giving you a temporary ""lift""."
Bonnie McFarlane,politics,I don't know why I try to talk about politics publicly when I have no idea what I'm talking about. I feel like I should be auditioning for 'The View.'
Bonnie McFarlane,"religion,atheism,agnosticism","I grew up in a mixed religious household. And it was volatile. My dad’s atheist, my mom’s agnostic. Just constant fighting. ""There’s no God!"" ""There might be!"""
Bonnie McFarlane,"women,success","You know, women are burdened with all this other crap all the time, like looking good. You need to be really superhuman to be successful as a woman."
Bonnie McFarlane,television,"But it’s like guys are thinking, ""I don't want to fuck her, what is she doing on my television?"""
Bonnie McFarlane,,"I don't want to brag, but I do speak Pig Latin; I mean, I'm not fluent, but I'm sure if I ever went there, I could get by."
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"My sister is also retarded. Across the board. She's a one hundred per cent, honest to goodness, born that way retard. I learned a long time ago that if you're going to tell a story about your retarded sister, you need to mention she's retarded right off the bat or inevitably, at the end of the story, someone will say, ""What... is she, retarded?"" And then you have to go, ""Uh... yeah, she is."" Followed by a lengthy, awkward silence."
Bonnie McFarlane,sisters,"My sister likes comedy. And she likes it a little mean sometimes. She'll point out your fat ass or ask if you're wearing a wig. She knows how to dish it out, too."
Bonnie McFarlane,,When one door closes another door opens. Usually a refrigerator.
Bonnie McFarlane,dating,"I've always dated Jewish men, and I don't know why. What am I saying? I know exactly why that is - it's because I have a really little vagina."
Brad Stine,,"I suffer from two phobias: 1) Phobia-Phobia, the fear that you're unable to get scared, and 2) Xylophataquieopiaphobia, the fear of not pronouncing words correctly."
Brad Stine,,"Because when the Creator of matter, tell you you matter, then you have a purpose and then you have self-esteem."
Brad Stine,,"People don't realize, or maybe they've forgotten, that there was a time in history when standup comedy wasn't something that you had to hide your kids' ears from."
Brad Stine,,"We should have a way of telling people they have bad breath without hurting their feelings. ""Well, I'm bored. Let's go brush our teeth."" Or, ""I've got to make a phone call. Hold this gum in your mouth."""
Brad Stine,coma,"God is a crutch? Yeah, well, not believing in God is a coma."
Brad Stine,"truth,politics","The way to stop political correctness is to not do it. If someone says, ""You offended me"" then you say ""I don’t care!"" If they’re offended by the truth, that’s their issue!"
Brad Stine,"truth,change","If the truth conflicts with my beliefs, I change my beliefs."
Brad Stine,animals,You’re not a bunch of people lock-stepped with the politically correct. Oh no! Don’t shoot the animals! They might get their feelings hurt!
Brad Stine,,"Who is more irrational? A man who believes in a God he doesn't see, or a man who's offended by a God he doesn't believe in?"
Brad Stine,california,"If you can't say something nice... about an overrated, ungrateful European nation that would have been wiped off the face of the earth twice in the twentieth century if it weren't for the United States and which has given nothing to the culture in the past two hundred years but whine and cheese, both of which are made better in California, then don't say anything at all!"
Brad Stine,politics,"The wussification of America is killing us by teaching us to censor ourselves from what we believe. That’s why I want to see political correctness die in my lifetime, but first... I want to watch it suffer."
Brad Stine,,"When you're at a comedy club, if you're not funny, you don't work. People will let you know, whether it's by booing or yelling for you to get out of the club. People are drunk or whatever and they'll let you have it."
Brad Stine,,"Comedy, if it's done well, can reflect the mood of a nation. It can be a mirror to who we are, what we believe in, what we are like."
Brad Stine,religion,"You know what offends me? Offended people. In a country with guaranteed rights to freedom of religion, its citizens are constantly trying to make faith in public spheres illegal, I am offended by that contradiction and want to talk about it as a comic."
Brad Stine,,I hope that nothing ever wussifies me to deny my own personal beliefs. Brainwashed wussies have been taught that standing up for yourself and defending your personal point of view makes you a close-minded hate monger. One must also be respectful of dissenting belief while supporting their own.
Brad Stine,,I always enjoyed Carlin for turning the tables on culture. He is an excellent writer that has endured for decades.
Brad Stine,"differences,government","Conservative concepts believe in little government - take care of yourself, and that makes men who invent things like the constitution! Liberal thought has big government - we’ll take care of you - and that creates boys and they create things like Occupy Wall Street! There’s a difference between the way men and boys behave."
Brad Stine,happiness,"You want to reclaim your country? You got to go back to the first men who started this country, the founding fathers and this is going to be shocking for the liberal professors out there that are indoctrinating our kids but the founding fathers believed in the Judeo-Christian god that believed we have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness! You can pursuit it. If you don’t get it, it’s your fault! You messed up. Go back to work. Work harder."
Brad Stine,,"When did banning anything, ever work? I mean, we banned liquor once in this country, oh, that worked like a charm, didn't it, folks? You couldn't find a drink in the roaring 20's, could ya? See that's the problem with the banning thing! I say why stop there, let's not ban guns, I know, let's ban crime!"
Brad Stine,politics,It’s about something that strikes you as funny but I do it with a Christian world view: why we think the way we do based on God’s plan. I lift up my God and my country and I resist political correctness.
Brad Stine,truth,The truth is supposed to hurt. That's how it lets you know you don't got it.
Brad Stine,women,"Talk about sexist - have you ever, ever, heard someone come up to a woman and say ‘find your masculine side?’ And by the way women, if you find your masculine side - I’m not interested."
Brad Stine,,"They got special terms that they use when they're pregnant. They don't even say ""pregnant"", got special words they use - ""I'm expecting"". Expecting what? ""I'm expecting a child, silly."" Well, then, you probably got a good shot!"
Brad Stine,,"If we all die and there is no God, then it’s just eternal unconsciousness, you’ll never know, but if you’re wrong... you’ll know forever."
Brad Stine,smoking,"Oh, I know: If you’re fat, let’s not blame you, let’s sue McDonalds! Oh, for cryin’ out loud, hey, if you smoke, not your fault, it’s the tobacco company’s fault! Hey, if you shoot somebody, not your fault, let’s blame the gun industry!"

Brett Butler,hate,I hate bigots so much it makes me one.
Brett Butler,,The most dramatic realization was that in surrender I would find more freedom and power than I'd ever known.
Brett Butler,,"The beginning of my sin, if you will, was thinking that it was all a mistake and that I absolutely didn't deserve any of it. I'll tell you, bringing down my own creation that way was as grandiose a way of playing God as you could imagine."
Brett Butler,talent,"I wanted to be a general manager. I wanted to kind of run the show, wanted to get out there and get into the nuts and bolts of finding the talent and trying to coordinate putting the club together and doing the scouting part of it and go through the whole thing."
Brett Butler,accidents,There are no accidents. God's just trying to remain anonymous.
Brett Butler,comedians,There's something very weird and abnormal about my particular quest to do stand-up; it's very isolating and self-important.
Brett Butler,,"'I hate to do this, but the organization is going in a different direction,' but that everything I did was fine."
Brett Butler,,I feel really grateful to have been part of what I considered a good TV show.
Brett Butler,,"I have more love in me than not, I have more hope in me than not, and I have more faith than I used to. I just want to get out of the way of what I've been given, so I can do it right."
Brett Butler,,It means everything. You don't want to go through your four years of high school with a certain team beating you four years in a row. You always want to show them you can come out on top in the end.
Brett Butler,desire,"Instead my life has been like being mashed and mashed through a wine press until finally there will be nothing left but the desire to live by divine will, knowing what I'm really supposed to do and doing it."
Brett Butler,,"I spent the first twenty years of my life waiting for two men I was reasonably certain would never come back - my daddy and Jesus Christ. I don't wait for them anymore. My dad, anyway. And at least with Jesus I didn't spend all that time thinking he was gone because of something I did."
Brett Butler,business,Revivals used to come to town. They would ask who wanted to be saved and I’d march right to the front. It was then I knew I was destined for a career in show business or at least alcoholism.

Brian Regan,,I'm trying to do things I have never done. Like I recently went to 3 different ballets. And I loved trying to learn how to like those a little bit.
Brian Regan,,"I think comedy is a good way to deal with anything. I hear about people in the hospital who are ill, and they use humor to help them through it. I think it's a great remedy for many things."
Brian Regan,,"So when you do get on, the first class people are already sitting there; they're all sprawled out on their big thrones. ""Bring me the head of a pig! And a goblet of something cool and refreshing! Anyone have a fiddle? Amuse me."""

This guy comes up: 'Hey buddy, would you mind getting out of the painters' scaffolding?'"
Brian Regan,,"That’s why I admired that kid who spelled it wrong on purpose so he could sit down. He knew he wasn’t going to win, so why stand there for 3 hours. First round. ""Cat, K-A-T, I'm outta here."" Then as he passed you, ""Ha! I know there's 2 T's."" "

""Well do you have a bathroom scale?"" ""Uh, ya but if I put the box on the scale it's gonna cover up the numbers!"" What, do I take it off really quick? Ah, zero: I'm not fast enough. What's he talking about? So then he gives me his Mister Wizard Formula, ""How about if you stand on the scale and weigh yourself and get off the scale.

Brian Regan,,So my doctor told me to watch what I'm eating - to read food labels. I'm in the store reading the Fig Newtons label: I've always liked Fig Newtons. I'm reading the label to make sure everything's fine: fat content. I looked at the serving size; two cookies. Who eats two cookies? I eat Fig Newtons by the sleeve: two sleeves is a serving size. I open them both and eat them like a tree chipper; Fig Newton shavings coming off the side.

Brian Regan,fishing,"You watch a fishing show. At the end, they roll credits. There's 90 people involved with these two guys fishing! What the hell are they all doing?

Brian Regan,hitler,"Reading is hard. You ever try that? I read good. Goodly. But I hate when you're trying to read something and you come across the expression 'One thing led to another'. What in the hell kind of lazy writing is that? Isn't that your job as the writer to tell me how this led to that? You can just throw that in there? ""Adolf Hitler was rejected as a young man on his application to art school... One thing led to another... And the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the sovereign nation of Japan."" This is some pamphlet!"
Brian Regan,,How could instantly improved vision not be at the top of your TO DO list?

Honey, did we pay that parking ticket?!"""
Brian Regan,neighborhood,"You know, a lot of people’s last names are based on the occupations of their ancestors. That’s true. Just in my neighborhood, right across the street lived the Cooks. Right next door to us lived the Taylors. Counter-corner from us lived the Elephant Dung Shovelers."
Brian Regan,,"They always say that Albert Einstein was a genius. Then how come when anyone ever calls you that, it's an insult? 'You don't know where you parked the car? Good job, Einstein.' I don't think we're honoring that man properly by using his name in vain in parking lots."

Yeah I think we're... Oh! We're getting close! Oh! This is gonna be a bad blasting zone! Remember that last one - we lost Billy?"
Brian Regan,,"The hard part was being the kid that got sent in first to calm Mom down before you dragged in the actual banged up brother. So you'd have to run in, 'Hey, Mom, everything's fine. I just wanted to run in at full speed and say hi. And OK, so, you know Kevin? Of course. Well, you know how his right arm - usually it would bend like that? It's not bending like that right now. And it's no big deal because we already looked at it.

Brian Regan,,"""How many outs Brian?"" ""Grape! I'm gonna get grape, or cherry. They're both... favorites, so either one is good, but if they have both, I'll get grape, because grape is a little more favorite.

Yeah, don’t just splash it on my face. ‘Would you like cream and sugar with that?’ Is it black cream? If not, I’ll take it blackity black, black. Filled with blackness. Devoid of all light.

Brian Regan,,"I have a friend who swears by food combinations - have you heard of this nonsense? She's nuts. She's like, 'You know what? You should eat food combinations, and that way you can eat whatever you want. It's just the combinations of how you put the food together.'

Brian Regan,toasters,"I’m lookin’ at the Pop-Tarts box and I notice they have directions on there. I give up on this species… They have toaster directions, which, I’m not makin’ this up, the toaster directions are longer than one step.

Bruce Bruce,,"Now, I want to explain something to you guys. I don't have an ending joke, because I don't tell jokes. I tell real-life stories and make them funny.

So, basically, when I get through performing on stage, I just walk off."

Bruce Bruce,,"Sometimes I can do a pretty clean show, since I perform at churches all the time. And sometimes I might use a ""damn"" or ""shit"" that comes out. But there's nothing that's vulgar or disrespectful. It's all good and it's all still funny, though. And I don't care what color the crowd is - black, white, Asian, whoever. It don't matter. Funny's funny and I'm gonna get them to laugh."

Carlos Mencia,,I don't have the time to steal other people's material even if I wanted to. The reason why these rumors got started is that I don't really contest them because I don't believe they deserve contesting. I really don't.
Carlos Mencia,,"We dropped two bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and the name of the plane that delivered the weapons was the Enola Gay. Do you know why? Because we wanted them to know that they were about to get boned in the ass."

Carlos Mencia,,"When I go onstage, I don't know what I'm going to say. I don't know what's going to come out of my mouth. It's one of those questions where any and everything is possible.

And here are some batteries, for your creeping-me-out machine. Now get the fark out of my store! I hope I am reincarnated as a turtleneck... Thank you for getting that joke!"
Carlos Mencia,,"Every single man in this room has crapped his pants. There is not a man in here that has not done that. Sometimes we don't even know when it happens. Sometimes we take off our underwear and go, 'Oh my God, where did that come from?' That's where the term 'holy shit' comes from."

Carol Leifer,celebrities,"You know what kills me about Jennifer Lopez? The fact that this woman wakes up one day and she's like, 'You know what? From now on, I'd like people to call me J-Lo,' and then they do it. Only a celebrity can get away with this.

Carol Leifer,,"I had been vegan for about six months when I went to a taping of Ellen's show. She had heard that I was vegan and was inquiring about it.

And after reading a book like Skinny Bitch or seeing videos from inside a dairy farm or a slaughterhouse, it's really hard to turn back. Because we love animals so much, it's the next logical step."

I was very attached to my father and had this naive little-girl notion that he'd always be around. So I'm finding acceptance of my father's death is the hardest thing to accept."
Carol Leifer,"differences,dating","What is a date, really, but a job interview that lasts all night? The only difference between a date and a job interview is that in not many job interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it."
Carol Leifer,,"It was a mixed marriage. I'm human, he was a Klingon."
Carol Leifer,,"They're all sources of material. What I love about what I do, the more you talk about your life, there are so many people who have similar experiences."
Carol Leifer,,"Like a lot of women, I'm bisexual. Once I have sex with you - bye!"
Carol Leifer,,"I think what I would say to my younger self, and probably to younger, just starting-out writers is that a lot of times you're just afraid to put yourself out there, and it's uncomfortable because it's working up the courage to do something, to push yourself to do those things."
Carol Leifer,airports,"Oh my God, Kennedy Airport - what a mess - all over you with those dopey security questions. 'Did you receive any gifts from any unknown persons?' Buddy, the last thing I got from an unknown person was in the 80's."
Carol Leifer,,"Growing up, it was always, ‘If you buy kosher meat, they’re killed humanely.’ But I’ve seen so many horrible videos. What we thought was humane 100 years ago is not humane anymore. The ways animals suffer, I just couldn’t be a part of it anymore."
Carol Leifer,attitude,"She reminds me of Roseanne before she was discovered. Darlene has that same clear point of view and a very dry, take-charge kind of attitude."
Carol Leifer,,I'm not afraid of putting myself out there to someone and then them passing on it. At least you could have gotten a 'yes.' So it's worthwhile to have the cojones to do it.
Carol Leifer,,I've seen too many comics who got their own shows and were undone because they worked for an executive producer who didn't understand their comedy or their sensibility.
Carol Leifer,,"My father was a really funny guy. He lived a good long life. And he was the reason I wanted to be funny and become a comedian and a comedy writer, so to say that he's somewhat of a mythic figure in my life would be an understatement."
Carrot Top,,My way of fitting in was through jokes and making people laugh.
Carrot Top,,"Some people even think I wear a wig. Do they think I went into a salon one day and said, ""Can you please screw this up really bad?"""
Carrot Top,,"I think, over the years, I've kind of evolved."
Carrot Top,,"My real name is Scott Thompson. I could have gone by that name, but when I started doing comedy I thought I needed to go by something that has a little more of a hook."
Carrot Top,,Carrot Top is a nickname that people call me and I thought that it was more marketable.
Carrot Top,future,So I try not to look too far into the future because I think that everything happens and will happen for a reason.
Carrot Top,,"I was the class clown at school, but at home, my family wasn't very funny."

Carrot Top,,I always make fun of KISS because I don't particularly think their music is anything.
Carrot Top,advertising,I always thought marketing in general was an interesting kind of thing. I always liked commercials and billboards.
Carrot Top,,Everyone has the gift of laughter inside of them. All the world is a prop.
Carrot Top,,"When I told my friends I was going to be a comedian, they laughed at me."
Carrot Top,,There's nothing wrong with trying to reach out to new fans.
Carrot Top,,People do give me a hard time about my hair because it's orange and it's big.
Carrot Top,,I didn't really have a plan of attack when I got in college.
Carrot Top,,My way of making people like me was to make 'em laugh.
Carrot Top,,"Like I told Howard, I can't help it that I'm beautiful."
Carrot Top,success,I think it's the fact that I do something different and that I actually have some success with it. That bothers a lot of people... especially comics.
Carrot Top,girlfriends,"It's weird, I never wish anything bad upon anybody, except two or three old girlfriends."
Carrot Top,,"Video games are so popular these days, getting the opportunity to star in one is something special. More people should do it."
Carrot Top,,People always want to put a label on you; they always want to compare you to something.
Carrot Top,"neighborhood,audience","The street in the center of town was Butts road. I stole the sign and told the audience, this must be where the assholes live. I also had a Neighborhood Crime Watch - it takes about 20 seconds to break into a house but it took me an hour to unbolt this sign."
Carrot Top,florida,"On the weekends, I would go down and play these clubs in Key West or West Palm Beach or surrounding areas of Florida and then I'd go back to school for the week."
Carrot Top,"people,success,hate",It's our nature: Human beings like success but they hate successful people.
Carrot Top,advertising,The blessing is that everyone knows who I am because of the commercials.
Cedric the Entertainer,love,"It is a big world that we live in, and people have a choice to love who they love."
Cedric the Entertainer,,They’ve come to kill us! And take our women! And our precious metals!
Cedric the Entertainer,questions,"Never in life do you hear about a large group of black people getting killed altogether. 'Cuz we run. Nigga, we run when we see somebody else runnin'. We don't ask no questions why we runnin', we don't need no run coordinator to get the runnin' all organized. Nigga, if I'm with you, and you start runnin'...dammit, I'ma start runnin'!"
Cedric the Entertainer,,"Well, you know, my name is Ced and I kinda consider myself an entertainer. Hey that ain’t bad yeah, Cedric the Entertainer."
Cedric the Entertainer,jail,"I can’t go to jail, not with his soft skin and these boyish good looks. I’ll be snapped up before the first lights out!"
Cedric the Entertainer,,I've been blessed to have a long career.
Cedric the Entertainer,audience,"We as comics do want an immediate response from the audience. It's really quiet on the set, and there are only the producers, and the director, so a comic is looking for someone to give a reaction, even if it is the camera guy."
Cedric the Entertainer,,"I want to be a little more dramatic nowadays. I definitely want something big and funny, but I look for things that can just have people see me in a different light and let me mature as both an entertainer and an actor and a comedian."
Cedric the Entertainer,,"I love stand up and it keeps me grounded, to say the stuff I have been thinking without anyone changing it."
Cedric the Entertainer,"politics,twitter","Politics move, as fast as Twitter, and for everyone to think that in four years America was going to be perfect is ridiculous."
Cedric the Entertainer,,"If I want my chips? Yeah, I want my chips. Who is this?"
Chelsea Handler,,I'd like to go out for a cocktail... or seven.
Chelsea Handler,,Katie Holmes told In Style magazine that Tom’s turned on by the sight of her in a suit and miniskirt. Tom also likes it when Katie wears the monitoring bracelet on her ankle.
Chelsea Handler,,My mom was kinda like a cat. She slept a lot.
Chelsea Handler,,I tried to put myself up for adoption several times.
Chelsea Handler,,I don't cook... I don't know how to clean... there's may be a good chance I'm an alcoholic.
Chelsea Handler,,"Most men would never tell a girl her Pikachu smells like a crab cake. It's just not done. But they would have no qualms about telling their guy friends. Similarly, if you're a guy and you pull your pants down, and the girl you're with immediately stats text messaging her friends, you have a small penis."
Chelsea Handler,,No one has ever said to me ‘go home and make a baby.’ I have been told several times to go to Planned Parenthood and make the baby go away. Happy Hannukah.
Chelsea Handler,babies,"Having a baby, it's like a five year commitment."
Chelsea Handler,,"People always tell me I need to have a kid, and I say, ""No, I don't."" Because I wouldn't have just one kid; I'd have six. I need a huge family. So I just kind of fill my house with tons of rejects and misfits so it feels like I have a bunch of children."
Chelsea Handler,,"I think the people I talk about are generally so stupid that they don’t even know I’m saying bad things about them. I've run into Paris Hilton and she’s like, ""Oh, I love your show."" And I’m like, ""You can’t love my show if you can hear."""
Chelsea Handler,,"I don’t know what’s going on with Britney. I think by now she’s her own species. We need to catch her, tag her and send her back out into her natural habitat - Starbucks - so we can observe her and learn more about her."
Chelsea Handler,,"You don't run into ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends when you're looking good and want to. Last time I ran into an ex-boyfriend was at three o'clock in the morning at Rite Aid, as I'm ringing up Gas X and corn removers. And I'm like, 'Hey, you. What's up? These are for my grandmother, that old bitch.' He's like, 'Aren't they both dead?' I'm like, 'One of them came back, OK? And she's sick.'"
Chelsea Handler,,"When you hit rock bottom, you've got to go to AA. They make it sound so dirty. Please, I've hit rock bottom dozens of times. I've woken up next to a billy goat. You don't just give up."
Chelsea Handler,respect,"He's really committed... to being an alcoholic, and I respect that."
Chelsea Handler,,For months there have been rumors that J.Lo is finally pregnant with Marc Anthony’s baby. She was afraid it might never happen. I’m afraid it’s going to look like Marc Anthony...

Chelsea Handler,,An L. A. County Superior Court judge issued an order today taking custody of Britney’s two children away from her. K-Fed was surprised when Larry Birkhead swooped in at the last moment and grabbed them for himself.
Chelsea Handler,,"Next to fat babies, midgets are my favorite things to hold. I love them so much, and I want to help them to do adult things like drive cars, Jet-Ski, and lip-synch. I’m in awe of their little limbs, their large craniums, and their medicine-ball asses. I love the little baby steps they take while shifting their weight from side to side, and the fact that when you knock one over accidentally, he flails like a turtle on its back that can’t get up right away."
Chelsea Handler,,"I wish it was that easy to get turned on for me - at this point, I need a bottle of Belevere and a fighterjet."
Chelsea Handler,,Why would you go out and not drink? Just stay home and sit there.
Chelsea Handler,,"First of all, I'm not an actor - I'm an asshole."

Chelsea Handler,,I think they should make Twilight closets and all the cast members can walk out of them.
Chelsea Handler,,"Boy George has been charged with falsely imprisoning a man who'd gone to his apartment to pose for photographs. Going to Boy George's house to get your picture taken is like going to David Copperfield's island for a ""radio opportunity""."
Chelsea Handler,,Kristen Stewart always looks like she's posing for pictures taken in a basement by her creepy uncle.
Chelsea Handler,,That's Al Qaeda's new plan: to destroy America one period at a time.
Chelsea Handler,,Most republicans are against contraception because they don't care about it. You can't get pregnant anally anyway.
Chelsea Handler,,Nicole Richie’s baby shower is going to be this Sunday at 12:30 in the afternoon. It should be a very special event - many of these people are going to be seeing each other for the first time in broad daylight.
Chelsea Handler,,"Paris Hilton is one of the hosts for Nicole Richie’s baby shower, and they’re serving sushi. Awesome, Paris - sushi, the one thing pregnant women are forbidden to eat. Thanks for the mercury."

Chelsea Handler,,"A federal grand jury is investigating allegations that David Copperfield raped, assaulted and threatened a woman he took to his private island in the Bahamas in July. What happened to the good old days when a guy would just saw you in half?"
Chelsea Handler,,"I know they don’t recommend Ibuprofen during pregnancy, but you needed something fast for the hangovers."
Chelsea Handler,,"They come over and they go, 'Why don't you come over on Friday night? We're gonna have a bunch of people over. We're gonna have game night. It's gonna be nutty.' Unless we're playing 'Who's Hiding the Ecstasy?' I'm not gonna make it, OK? 'Cause that's my favorite game."
Chelsea Handler,,That's Al Qaeda's new plan: to destroy America one period at a time.
Chelsea Handler,,We spend so much money on these dresses that are terrible. And what do we get out of it? Nothing - a piece of chicken and a roll in the hay with her hillbilly cousin - no thank you. My family's very close; I can do that at home.
Chelsea Handler,,"The L. A. Times is reporting that Britney Spears' album Blackout will be number one on the Billboard charts. Not to toot my horn, but I predicted this on my show a week ago. No one wanted to believe me - even I didn't want to believe me, but now I know how Nostradamus feels."
Chelsea Handler,,Paris Hilton has launched a new champagne in a can called Rich Prosecco. For the ad campaign Paris posed wearing nothing but gold paint. That’s a unique way to cover up herpes.
Chelsea Handler,,"This kind of mixing of ingredients happens all the time at fast-food places... You know when you order french fries and there's a rogue onion ring at the bottom. You know, at first you're alarmed but you eat it. It all comes from the same place! You just have to go for it."
Chelsea Handler,,It’s true what they say about patience being a virtue; it just happens to be a virtue that I choose not to pursue.
Chelsea Handler,,I was in a tailspin of confusion I hadn't experienced since the first time I heard George W. Bush speak.
Chelsea Handler,girlfriends,One of my girlfriends was getting married. This was becoming an annoying pattern.

Chelsea Handler,,"I look hot and, most of all, skinny. I love the day after throwing up. I felt like a feather."

Chelsea Handler,,I find it very annoying when people want to sit next to each other at a booth.
Chelsea Handler,,The only reason I think I would marry a foreigner would be to have kids with weird accents.
Chelsea Handler,,I don't think anyone should have 20 kids. You need to spread your seed somewhere else. Go shit in your sock once in a while.
Chelsea Handler,,"If diamonds are a girl's best friend, I wonder if blood diamonds are a girl's best friend 5 days out of the month?"
Chelsea Handler,,"I would rather sit next to a transgender person and discuss why every single one I've met smells like a bar in the daytime than listen to people tell my why I want to have children and that I just don't know it yet. I do know, because I'm me and my feelings are the ones in my head. I don't want to have kids, and it's not a device to get attention or have conversations about it. I simply find children incredibly immature and, more often than not, dumb."
Chelsea Handler,,I don't know what it is about accents that makes me want to get undressed and high-five myself.
Chelsea Handler,,You know you're a hot mess when the only person buying you drinks all night is yourself.
Chelsea Handler,,"I watched the American Music Awards last night. Beyonce lost in all three of her categories, but she did win a special award - which was our way of saying we still love you but we need to see other people."
Chelsea Handler,,"In a statement to the Associated Press earlier in the year, Jamie Lynn said she didn't have a boyfriend. She said, ""I'm keeping my options open."" And by options, she meant legs."
Chelsea Handler,,"It looks like Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are ‘taking a break.’ Their engagement is off, and Heidi is going back to Colorado. This is really sad for Heidi and for all the Hills fans and for the entire state of Colorado."
Chelsea Handler,,"If you wait too long in Vegas, you end up with a chicken finger in your underwear."
Chelsea Handler,,"I went one time. It wasn't voluntary; it was pretty much court ordered. But I thought I could give back to the AA community, you know, see all those single hottie men there. I could be like a sponsor. Have them call me at two in the morning, and be like, 'I want to have a drink.' I'll be like, 'I have one! Come over!'"
Chelsea Handler,"dogs,gays","Another thing I take issue with are people who take their dogs on ""play dates,"" or even worse, people who choose to dress their dogs up in outfits better suited for homosexuals participating in a gay pride parade. Dog costumes are right up there with something else I find particularly offensive: sweater vests."
Chelsea Handler,,You don't give something away because it's fat. You take it and you look at it.
Chelsea Handler,,It's good that people don't like you. That's good. It means that you are doing something interesting.
Chelsea Handler,,"I'm not graceful either. I have no rhythm, I'm never on top."
Chelsea Handler,,The only people I owe an apology to are my dead parents. Except my father because he's still alive.
Chelsea Handler,,Can you imagine getting a gun for a secret Santa? That is especially not a good idea if you work in a post office.
Chelsea Handler,,Who's the president on the $100 bill? I don't know. I don't need to know because I don't use cash. I only use travelers checks.
Chelsea Handler,,"Why don't you get me a gift? I'm still single! I don't know if you can register at a liquor store, but I would like to try."
Chelsea Handler,dating,"When I don't know what to do, I just open my mouth. Why won't anyone date me?"
Chelsea Handler,addiction,Mexico's a great place to overcome a drug addiction.
Chelsea Handler,,If you treat your kid like a dick and you're a dick... you're gonna have a family of dicks.
Chelsea Handler,,It’s so weird that I would say something wrong.
Chelsea Handler,,"If you can't trust your coke dealer, who can you trust?"
Chelsea Handler,,There's a McDonalds in Hong Kong & they're offering couples the opportunity to get married. You can have a McWedding.
Chelsea Handler,,Everybody I hire is more fucked up than I am.
Chelsea Handler,,I'll tell you what can make bacon better... nothing.
Chelsea Handler,,He's as gay as a candle in the wind.
Chelsea Handler,,"In these tough economic times, everybody has to cut back. I am down to three tabs of ecstasy a day."
Chelsea Handler,,"Then they have the audacity to go shopping and pick out their own gifts. I want to know who the first person was who said this was okay. After spending all that money on a bachelorette weekend, a shower, and often a flight across the country, they expect you to go to Williams Sonoma or Pottery Barn and do research? Then they send you a thank-you note applauding you for such a thoughtful gift. They're the one who picked it out!"
Chelsea Handler,"aggression,confidence","I've found that many of the people who have a passion for karaoke too often have misplaced confidence, which can become aggressive and border on sadistic. I know my limits, and karaoke is where I draw the line. I wouldn't put anyone through the hell of listening to me sing a song, and I sure as shit wouldn't wait in line to do it."
Chelsea Handler,,"What about your constitutional right to bear arms, you say. I would simply point out that you don’t have to exercise a constitutional right just because you have it. You have the constitutional right to run for president of the United States, but most people have too much sense to insist on exercising it."
Chelsea Handler,,"Drew Carey was the guest on Ellen's breakdown show. You know, the next night, when he was hosting The Price Is Right, he ended his show with ""Don't forget to spay and neuter your pets, and for God's sake don't ever take one away from Ellen!"""
Chelsea Handler,cocaine,Amy Winehouse’s mother wrote an open letter to the News of the World newspaper telling Amy she’s worried about her and to please call her. I doubt this is the best way to communicate with Amy - she should try spelling it out in lines of cocaine.
Chelsea Handler,,"I'm very much about letting other people shine, because it makes us all shine brighter."
Chelsea Handler,,I didn't become a comedian to work this hard.
Chelsea Handler,politics,"I'm into politics, and I love watching the heavier news magazine shows."
Chelsea Handler,dreams,"It's a dream come true to have someone else portray me. Because I've been living this life for a long time, and I'm over myself."
Chelsea Handler,,People ask me why I'm so hard on men. It's because they've gotten a really easy ride. And it's not that I think women should take over the world. But I do think it should be 50/50.
Chelsea Handler,,"My relationship with my father had been on the proverbial fritz since the time I was fifteen and called the police to report him for child molesting. He had never molested me, but I wanted to have a party that weekend and needed him out of the house."
Chelsea Handler,comedians,I'll always be doing stand-up as long as people are still interested in seeing me.

Chelsea Handler,,It became clear when I got in my car that Persians are only really good for two things. Oil and hummus.
Chelsea Handler,,"I had to feign interest in all this nonsense until I could ask when I could come over and sit on his face. I didn't say that out loud, of course. I never say the things I really want to. If I did, I'd have no friends."
Chelsea Handler,respect,"I have more respect for somebody who's like, 'Yeah I like to party, so screw off,' then for Tara , who talks about not partying and ends up passed out underneath a Subway, not a subway station, but the actual sandwich shop - two days later."
Chelsea Handler,asians,They travel in groups. You never see an Asian by their self.
Chelsea Handler,,"When you see the veins popping out of my neck, that's an exclamation point."
Chelsea Handler,,"It's hard to tell these days what gender people are. You don't know if they're gay, if they're straight, or Bruce Jenner."
Chelsea Handler,,"I was tortured, and probably half of it was deserved, but I was bullied - so much so that there were days when I was like, 'I can't go to school today.' I was too scared."
Chelsea Handler,,I think we can all agree that sleeping around is a great way to meet people.

Chelsea Handler,embarrassment,"Rumer Willis was having a great time at the opening of a club when her twin walked in, also known as her dad, Bruce Willis. How embarrassing for her, she’s out with her friends and they’re like, ‘Umm, Rumer, I think your dad put something in my drink.’"
Chelsea Handler,driving,"David Hasselhoff was hospitalized after falling off the wagon again. He probably got used to drinking too much, because for years he never had to worry about driving anywhere - his car drove itself."
Chelsea Handler,,Have you ever been to an AA meeting? No wonder these people are alcoholics - I've never needed a drink more badly in my life.
Chelsea Handler,"alcohol,coffee",I don’t like people who drink decaf coffee it’s like what. Why you drinking it? Like it taste so good? That’s like drinking non alcoholic vodka.
Chelsea Handler,,I would never get married while my father is still alive because I wouldn't want him to walk me down the aisle.
Chelsea Handler,,Anyone who is friends with Bill Clinton shouldn’t be telling their wife about it.
Chelsea Handler,,"He's so pissed off 'cause he probably thought he was, like, scoring the biggest deal of his lifetime, getting adopted by this famous movie star, who was gonna rescue him from his third world Cambodia, only to find out she's gonna take him to every other fucking third world country in the world. He's probably like, 'When the fuck are we getting to Malibu like you promised?'"
Chelsea Handler,,"I thought about becoming a lesbian. Those bitches look like they're having a helluva time, don't they? But then you gotta get into the whole lesbian scene, you know, and go buy hiking boots and a truck. And then, who pays for shit? I guess the guy who's watching, but what if he's not there?"
Chelsea Handler,"laziness,diapers",I would like to wear a diaper on days where I'm feeling lazy but... I don't. I shit my pants.
Chelsea Handler,"homeless,dogs",Then a homeless man with a dog approached us and put his hand out. This happens to be something that I have a real problem with: homeless people with pets who approach you for food when they have a perfectly delicious dog standing right there?

Chelsea Handler,,"I can remember my first one-night stand like it was yesterday. Well, maybe not the first. Or the second... or the fifth. I'll just begin with what I can remember and not concern myself with order."

Chelsea Handler,,There are two kinds of people I don't trust: people who don't drink and people who collect stickers.
Chelsea Handler,babies,Or people who have one baby and go buy a minivan... how big is your baby?
Chelsea Handler,pain,"Have you ever experienced a pain so sharp in your heart that it's all you can do to take a breath? It's a pain you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy; you wouldn't want to pass it on to anyone else for fear he or she might not be able to bear it. It's the pain of being betrayed by a person with whom you've fallen in love. It's not as serious as death, but it feels a whole lot like it, and as I've come to learn, pain is pain any way you slice it."
Chelsea Handler,,"So, my dad's like, 'You're not a lesbian, are you?' I'm like, 'No, I'm not a lesbian. I sleep with guys all the time.' He's like, 'Well, you're not a hooker, are you?' I'm like, 'No, I'm not a hooker. I don't charge people.'"

Chelsea Handler,,I got a vibrator that needed two nine volt batteries. What am I - R2D2? I don't know what to do with that.

When I was a little girl, I was like, ""Oh my god, I'm gonna wait 'til I go to college to lose my virginity."" I had all these big dreams. Then the third grade just ended up being such a nutty year."
Chelsea Handler,,"Getting rewarded for being pregnant when you’re a teenager? Are you serious? I mean, that makes me want to kill somebody."
Chelsea Handler,abortion,"I had an abortion when I was 16. Because that’s what I should have done. Otherwise I would now have a 20-year-old kid. Anyway, those are things that people shouldn’t be dishonest about it."
Chelsea Handler,,"While looking at a website for liposuction, I learned that it was a six-to eight-week recovery period, the clincher being that, during that time, I would under no circumstances be able to use street drugs. Obviously I had to think of a more realistic approach."
Chelsea Handler,dating,"My theory about Taylor Swift is that she's a virgin, that everyone breaks up with her because they date her for two weeks and she's like, 'I'm not gonna do it'."

Chelsea Handler,,"Well, I don't live in the past like you, so I don't remember."
Chelsea Handler,,"Lindsay Lohan fell in love while in rehab. Who wouldn’t? You share meals together, gaze into each other’s eyes, talk about your feelings and share one romantic sunset after another - for roughly $50,000 a month. Pretty pricey, considering a month of eHarmony.com is only $21."
Chelsea Handler,experience,"It’s been my experience that people who make proclamations about themselves are usually the opposite of what they claim to be. If someone is truly a loyal friend, then they wouldn't need to broadcast it; eventually, people will figure it out. I have a lot of good friends and not one of them has ever introduced themselves by saying, ""I'm a very good friend."""
Chelsea Handler,worth,There's a reason you never see anyone's house with a Beware of Cat sign. Because they're not even worth mentioning.
Chelsea Handler,"politics,vacation",He laid into me with the same gusto as a right-wing political pundit on the O'Reilly Factor defending President's Bush right to vacation six days out of the week.
Chelsea Handler,,"The problem with the suspenders my mother bought for him is that he hasn't adjusted the straps since he got them. So instead of attaching somewhere around his midsection, the suspenders clip onto his pants three inches below his nipples. Now picture the suspenders attached to sweatpants.

Chelsea Handler,,"At some point during almost every romantic comedy, the female lead suddenly trips and falls, stumbling helplessly over something ridiculous like a leaf, and then some Matthew McConaughey type either whips around the corner just in the nick of time to save her or is clumsily pulled down along with her. That event predictably leads to the magical moment of their first kiss. Please. I fall all the time. You know who comes and gets me? The bouncer."

Chelsea Handler,dogs,"I don't appreciate people who celebrate their dog's birthdays with ""dog parties,"" and then invite their friends who don't even have dogs. I understand why people like dogs, and I think they definitely bring more to the table than cats or those godforsaken ferrets, but I don't think it's healthy for people to treat their dogs like they are real people."
Chelsea Handler,emotions,"He was all emotion all the time, constantly talking about his feelings and his profound love for her. He was minutes from getting his first period. He wrote poems too. It's my personal belief that if men are writing poems, they're making up for something else like a big hair back, or one ball. Not that one ball is a bad thing. Especially since I don't know any females who are dying to their their hands on a set of balls. The way I see it, the less balls, the better."
Chelsea Handler,alcohol,"I wanted to kick Bruce in the taint. No one is just one thing. Many things contribute to the whole of a person, and just because vodka accounts for 50 percent of my body weight, that doesn't mean I walk around with a vodka drip, forcing every plant, person, or animal to imbibe. I've always had a disliking for animal trainers, and this guy cemented my theory that people who chaperone animals for a living have never had a girl sit on their face."

Chelsea Handler,"hate,sex","I hate that people assume guys are the only ones to want sex. Girls want sex, too, and that shouldn't be a problem."
Chelsea Handler,drugs,"Just because she’s singing about drugs, doesn’t mean she’s doing them. Ricky Martin sings about girls all the time."

Chelsea Handler,,You’re all fucked up and that’s kind of attractive.
Chelsea Handler,,"Everyone is coming from a place of fear and my feeling is stop being so afraid. If something doesn’t work then that’s fine at least then you know it doesn’t work. Don’t worry so much about it not working, you can always fix that."

Chelsea Handler,,"But then, like George Michael in a men's bathroom, I got cocky."

Chelsea Handler,babies,"I don't like people who have babies and act like they did something that the rest of us can't figure out. Anybody can have one, OK? I could have had three if I had gone through with any of my pregnancies."
Chelsea Handler,,"My mother told me that life isn't always about pleasing yourself and that sometimes you have to do things for the sole benefit of another human being. I completely agreed with her, but reminded her that that was what blow jobs were for."

Chelsea Handler,teachers,"According to an article on CNN.com, a new study says people who are bad kissers don’t get laid. Where are you supposed to learn how to kiss?

Chelsea Handler,,"We got to his place and it looked a lot like his personality. Just a bunch of space filler, nothing to really wow you.

Chelsea Handler,,My life and my legs have been an open book.
Chelsea Handler,weed,"Everyone knows if you're going to take weed to school, you put it in your trapper keeper to keep it fresh."

Chelsea Handler,,"There's a good chance I may be an alcoholic. You think guys would be a little more excited about that. All they do is bitch and moan. 'You drink too much. You sleep too much.' It's like, if you were drunk all the time, you'd be tired, too."
Chelsea Handler,"questions,weed","My question is - after you've been arrested three or four times, who calls up their friends and goes, 'Hey! Let's get an eight-ball, let's get a bag of weed, let's get a gun, let's get a six-pack and - fuck it - I'll drive!'"
Chelsea Handler,decisions,"Did you hear the new phenomenon that's going on about... letting the boys decide if they want to get circumcised? It's like, OK, it shouldn't be up to the boy. It should be up to the girl, the one that's going to be fucking him in 15 years - that should be her decision."

Chelsea Handler,fitness,"According to Life & Style, Lance Armstrong was seen canoodling with fitness model Kim Strother, and the night before, he was with Ashley Olsen.

Chelsea Handler,,"Britney Spears' album Blackout is one of the hottest-selling CDs in the country. We’re in a bad place, people: The world is melting, we're at war, and Two and a Half Men is a huge hit."
Chelsea Handler,baseball,"The part that wasn't a jackpot was his baseball mound of red pubic hair that looked like it had literally been attached with a glue gun. I couldn't believe how much there was, and wondered how he had never heard of scissors, or - more appropriate for that kind of growth - hedge trimmers. I didn't understand what porn he was watching to not be aware of the trimming that was happening all across the world among his compatriots. I'm not a finicky person when it comes to pubic hair maintenance and I certainly don't expect men to shave it all off, leaving themselves to look like a hairless cat. That's even creepier then than seeing what Austin had, which could really only be compared to one thing: A clown in a leg lock."
Chelsea Handler,,"Lance Bass has a new autobiography titled Out of Sync. We don’t need to read it, we already know how it ends - Justin is really successful, and Lance is gay."
Chelsea Handler,dogs,"My feeling is, if a dog is that hard up to break free, let it go. It's like a boyfriend who wants to break up. We all know the old adage ""If you set someone free, and he never comes back, then he was never yours."" I understand the main fear with setting dogs loose is they could get hit by a car, but so could an ex boyfriend. That's just a chance you have to take."
Chelsea Handler,,"If your back hurts because of your man purse, guess what else hurts? Your vagina."

Chris Hardwick,"worth,brain","Long ago you may have given up control of your brain and set it on autopilot either because it just felt like too much work. And it is work! But for me, this work was well worth it for the prospect of not waking up sad every day."
Chris Hardwick,emotions,"It’s very easy to attack ourselves. Even comforting in its familiarity, but you must resist this urge at all costs. Dwelling on the past or your perceived flaws will do nothing but keep you under emotional house arrest and hamper your progress. Commit yourself to growth and reward yourself with kindness for choosing to do so!"
Chris Hardwick,"complaints,danger","A lot of people complain in the year 2003 that it's not the world of tomorrow as foreseen in the 1950s. 'Where are the flying cars?' people say.

Chris Hardwick,,"If you’re able to build from your falls you’ll be unstoppable and damn near fearless. You see, every time you fall down and get back up, you add another piece of body armor to yourself. You learn what not to do, how to do better, and how to create comfort through practice."
Chris Hardwick,,"I realized my penis is like a retarded little brother. It means well, but ultimately it's driven by curiosity and the need to be hugged."

Chris Hardwick,,"You can't touch the strippers. Why are you paying to not touch someone? That is weird. How do you win in that situation? That is like walking into a deli, starving, and being like, 'Here's $300 - can I stare at the roast beef? Better yet, I'll sit down in this chair and you can mash it around my mouth and balls.'"
Chris Hardwick,,"Yeah you may have fucked up today, but you can still not fuck up tomorrow."
Chris Hardwick,brain,There are certain parts of a classic nerd’s brain that can destroy that person - obsessing about things to the detriment of everything else in your life. But those are the same tools that you can use to turn everything around.

Chris Hardwick,"school,teachers","All boys' Catholic school is a lot like going to a regular school, except your teacher is a priest - with benefits. No, I'm kidding. I was never touched by any priest in school. Which makes me think, 'Am I not attractive?'"
Chris Hardwick,,"Kids who are the product of old sperm are not right. The fresher the mayo, the better the sandwich. That is a very simple formula."
Chris Hardwick,brain,"Ah, self-confidence. You fickle, fickle slut, you. Sometimes you’re there, other times you’re with some other jerk, nowhere to be found. The idea of self-confidence is irritating the way it’s usually presented, like it’s some tangible ‘thing’ you can just throw onto your brain like a jacket."
Chris Hardwick,,"No human ever became interesting by not failing. The more you fail and recover and improve, the better you are as a person. Ever meet someone who’s always had everything work out for them with zero struggle? They usually have the depth of a puddle. Or they don’t exist."

Chris Hardwick,care,"I do podcasts for the same reasons I do stand-up comedy. I love it, and I don’t care if anybody else gets it."
Chris Hardwick,"television,advertising",All television is an advertisement - that’s why it exists. It wasn’t the art-form first and then the commerce - it was that they could put on entertainment long enough to distract people into looking at products. It’s for focusing people on advertising and separating you from money in some way. Some people forget that. The side product is that we get some great eye candy. TV is the best it has ever been right now. I don’t have a problem with that since it’s what keep us employed.
Chris Hardwick,,"There’s no ironic appreciation of things we love, even of things that are in fact ridiculous, which a hipster might take and own and show the world the humor in it."
Chris Hardwick,,The thing about hipsters is that they take very seriously trying to make themselves look like they don’t take themselves seriously.
Chris Hardwick,,Sober strip clubs are horrible. When you are sober you see the matrix code behind a strip club. You're paying girls to pretend to like you until you run out of money so they can walk away.

Chris Hardwick,,"It changed my whole outlook. I lost a decade to self-pity, and the next thing I knew I was turning 40."

Chris Rock,,"If you said more words to him than ""mommy'll be back"", he might know something!"
Chris Rock,cars,"I used to have horrible cars that would always end up broken down on the highway. When I tried to flag someone down, nobody stopped. But if I pushed my own car, other drivers would get out and push with me. If you want help, help yourself - people like to see that."

Chris Rock,dreams,"Fellas, when you wake up in the morning, you should look yourself in the mirror and say, ""Fuck you! Fuck your hopes, fuck your dreams, fuck your plans … fuck everything you thought this life was going to bring to you. Now let's go out there and try to make this bitch happy."""

Chris Rock,comedians,"The best part is just having a partner. There is no real worst part. I'm not going to say there's a worst part. I mean I'm a comedian - comedians like to work alone. So maybe I'm not the ideal guy to be married to, in that sense."
Chris Rock,,"Relationships, easy to get into, hard to maintain. Why are they so hard to maintain? Because it’s hard to keep up the lie! ‘Cause you can’t get nobody being you. You got to lie to get somebody."
Chris Rock,,I like talking about subjects that aren't funny in the first place and making them funny. So anything down and depressing is something I'll talk about.

Chris Rock,death,"When you die at 72, no matter what you die of, it's natural causes. Even if you get hit by a truck, it's natural causes. 'Cause if you was younger, you'd have got out the way!"
Chris Rock,,"I think pretty soon people gonna be fuckin' for gas. I think people already fuckin' for gas. Some of y'all in here tonight are fuckin' for gas. Like 'Girl, why you with him?' He filled up my tank."
Chris Rock,,"Even if you meet the perfect person, it ain't gonna be at the perfect time. You're married, they're single. That's right. You're Jewish, they're Palestinian. You're a Mexican, they're a raccoon. You're a black woman, he's a black man."

Chris Rock,addiction,"Actually, I think all addiction starts with soda. Every junkie did soda first. But no one counts that. Maybe they should. The soda connection is clear. Why isn't a presidential commission looking into this? Or at least some guys from the National Carbonation Council."
Chris Rock,neighborhood,I live in a neighborhood so bad that you can get shot while getting shot.
Chris Rock,,"People are starving all over the world, what do you mean, ""red meat will kill you""? Don't eat no red meat? No, don't eat no green meat. If you lucky enough to get your hands on a steak, bite the shit out of it!"

Chris Rock,"women,police","Women are like the police, they could have all the evidence in the world but they still want the confession."
Chris Rock,,"All people naturally hate. My kid bites people now. I didn't teach my kid to bite anybody. Kids say mean stuff. Only through love do we get this evil out of them. Only through love and structure and discipline do they not hate. The kids that hate didn't learn anything, that's the problem."
Chris Rock,abortion,"It's beautiful that abortion is legal in America. I love going to abortion rallies to pick up women, 'cause you know they're fucking. You ain't gonna find a bunch of virgins at the abortion rally. You might even see some clear heels!"
Chris Rock,,"A black C student can't do shit with his life. A black C student can't be a manager at Burger King. Meanwhile, a white C student just happens to be the President of the United States."

Shit, I love Tupac, I love Biggie, but school will be open on their birthday."

Chris Rock,,George Bush hates midgets.

There's no strippers in college! There's no clear heels in biology! Shit, man. I didn't know they had a college that only took one-dollar bills. And if they got so many strippers at college, how come I never got a smart lap dance? I never got a girl that sat on my lap and said, If I was you, I would diversify my portfolio. You know, ever since the end of the Cold War, I find NATO obsolete!."
Chris Rock,,"It's hard for a man to turn down sex … if they chase us, we can't run that fast."
Chris Rock,school,School shootings were invented by blacks... and stolen by the white man.

Chris Rock,,You won't be able to take your eyes off the next four presenters: Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz.
Chris Rock,,It's no different. It's not like I ever cursed around my mother or anything. I never had a hard time turning it on and off. It's like you enter another country - sometimes you're in a cursing country and then you're in a kid's country.
Chris Rock,,"I'm happy if everybody else is. I'm a big brother, the oldest. If you're happy and I'm not, I'm cool with that. If I'm happy and you're not, I'm sad."

Chris Rock,,"I've been married for 10 years and, you know, it's hard, you spruce it up and you go places. How do you spruce up anything? Artificially. You go places and do things."

Chris Rock,,"You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, Germany doesn't want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named ""Bush"", ""Dick"", and ""Colin."" Need I say more?"

Chris Rock,,"A bunch of girls say, ""You don't need no man to help you raise no child"" … shut the fuck up with the bullshit! Yeah, you could do it without a man, but that don't mean it's to be done! Shit, you can drive a car with your feet if you want to, that don't make it a good fucking idea!"
Chris Rock,neighborhood,"I just thought everybody lived around abandoned buildings and crack-heads. I lived in the ghetto until I was like 19. I came to Los Angeles, stayed at hotels and stuff. When I got back and I saw what my neighborhood looked like, I started getting scared."
Chris Rock,"white people,attitude","I was raised to believe that you had to do things better than white people in order to succeed. The old black shows were better than the white shows. The Jeffersons was a lot better. Good Times was way funnier. Sanford and Son. Now, though, everyone thinks we're equal, so we submit the same s... that everyone else submits. And then we get mad when they won't air it. You got to go back to the old attitude of it has to be twice as good."
Chris Rock,hollywood,"You want to track Hollywood careers, look in the real estate section. You see a guy buy a house that costs $6 million, and you can literally start counting the days until he starts doing crappy movies."

Chris Rock,nowdays,Guys play characters that won't grow up and something catastrophic happens and they have to grow up to save the day - that's pretty much what today's comedy is about.
Chris Rock,,"I don't write jokes first. I write down topics. I think of what I want to talk about, and then I write the jokes - they don't write me... And even if you don't think it's funny, you won't think it's boring. You might disagree, but you'll listen. And maybe even laugh as you disagree."
Chris Rock,,"It's weird with stand-up comedy. It doesn't really translate worldwide. I want to figure out how do I make it worldwide. Do a special in Africa. Can't beat that. Pull that off, then I will have done something."
Chris Rock,,"I'm a rap comedian the same way Bill Cosby is a jazz comedian, Cosby's laid back. I'm like, bang, bang bang, right into it."

Chris Rock,,"The material comes from whenever you realize that you and someone else have something in common. So any conversation you've had more than once, anything you see happening to you that you see happening to a friend, you go, ""Hmmm, that's a situation I can make funny."""
Chris Rock,,"I ain't shooting nobody, so call me a faggot. When the war's over, I'll be the faggot with two legs."
Chris Rock,racism,"Nothing more racist than a old black man, you know why? 'Cause the old black man went through some real racism. He ain't go through that ""I can't get a cab"" shit. He was the cab! White man just jump on his back: ""Main Street!"""
Chris Rock,,"You know what they say, ""There's no reason to ever hit a woman."" Shit! There's a reason to hit everybody. You just don't do it. Shit, there's a reason to kick an old man down a flight of stairs. You just don't do it. Ain't nobody above an ass-whooping."

Chris Rock,mexicans,Gas is getting so expensive I'm gonna ride a mexican to work.
Chris Rock,comedians,I never wanted to churn it out. Comedians tend to work all the time. They never put it down like musicians who might make an album then take three or four years off to recharge their batteries. Comedians tend to work straight through and they get stale because of that. Even when I didn't have a lot of money I never ever did it unless I had something new to say.
Chris Rock,,"Before I was a comedian, I thought the coolest thing that would happen to me was to be a teenager. Boy, was I wrong."
Chris Rock,,"You know, just right place right time, lucked up. Thank God for animation. I can turn down a lot of movies now."
Chris Rock,pain,"For me, anything goes when I pick up a mike. I'm not trying to hurt people - I try not to get too personal - but I look at myself as a reporter. If you can report on anything that has to do with pop culture, then why can't I make jokes about it? Yes, it hurts. But I figure that laughter sometimes starts from pain. You might wince, but then I know that I'm doing my job. The only thing I can do wrong is not be funny."
Chris Rock,,"Nobody's good. I hate it. I truly hate it. I mean, there's a lot of guys doing stuff I admire, but stand-up-wise I feel very alone. I really miss Bill Hicks. I wish I could have put him on my show. And I really miss Sam Kinison a lot. Richard Pryor's sick... It's like you get here and then, oh wait a minute, there's nobody here any more. I feel like the guy who finally got into Studio 54, three years too late, ""Duh, where are all the famous people?"""
Chris Rock,,I pride myself on being the guy who can do Def Comedy Jam and Charlie Rose. And do well on both.
Chris Rock,,"The only reaction that frightens me is people not laughing. It's extraordinary to me when you get a laugh. That you can go in front of a bunch of people you never met before, you can say some stuff and they all laugh in unison - that's amazing. It's a miracle."
Chris Rock,comedians,"Nobody really wants to be a stand-up, they want to get on TV."

Chris Rock,change,"I think if I were to get as big as I could get, it does change your mind-state. I think like the little man. I think like the underdog. I don't want to change that."
Chris Rock,politics,"I don't think my comedy is that political. It's more social. But whatever. When you make comedy and you do stand-up, you work alone. Movies have to go under so much scrutiny. A stand-up special is a vision, and a movie is a consensus in a lot of ways."
Chris Rock,,"Every comedian has a moment in his life when he realizes he's a little bit different from everyone else. It's like being the only guy in a movie who sees the ghost. The ghost talks to you and you talk to him. Then you turn to your friend and say, ""Hey. Do you see that ghost?"" And he says, ""What ghost?"""
Chris Rock,,I like the tradition of the Oscars. I like that some of the greatest comedians ever have hosted the show.

Chris Rock,dreams,"Once you're married, kiss all your dreams good-bye and ""make the bitch happy."" Good relationship is simply eating and fucking."
Chris Rock,"work,rain","Nobody's about saving anymore. No one cares about a rainy day anymore. Nobody saves up enough for even an umbrella for a rainy day. It's sad. It really is a new form of slavery. We used to work to be able to afford material things. Now we work for these things. They're the boss. That house you can't afford, that car that's out of your price range, that cellphone that drains your bank account - that's your boss."
Chris Rock,dancing,Who's judging American Idol? Paula Abdul? Paula Abdul judging a singing contest is like Christopher Reeve judging a dance contest!

Chris Rock,,You know what GED stands for? Good Enough Diploma.
Chris Rock,,"Everybody's so busy wanting to be down with the gang. ""I'm conservative"", ""I'm liberal"", ""I'm conservative"". Bullshit! Be a fucking person! Lis-ten! Let it swirl around your head. Then form your opinion. No normal, decent person is one thing, okay? I've got some shit I'm conservative about, I've got some shit I'm liberal about. Crime, I'm conservative. Prostitution, I'm liberal!"
Chris Rock,comedians,Comedians tend to find a comfort zone and stay there and do lamer versions of themselves for the rest of their career.
Chris Rock,white people,"All you crazy white people ""I'm American!"", all you did was come out of your mother's pussy on American soil. That's it. That's it! What, you think you're better than somebody from France 'cause you came out of a pussy in Detroit?"
Chris Rock,men,"Most parts in comedy, they're not really written for men. They're written for, like, these boy-men."
Chris Rock,,"My first year on 'SNL', I made $90,000 dollars."
Chris Rock,care,"It's got some heart, but it's got hard jokes. I care more about the hard jokes than the heart."

Chris Rock,"money,decisions","So if you're black or brown, you can make money in America, you can get rich in America … but whatever you decide to do, it better be positive, 'cause if one person is harmed, you will be destroyed.

Chris Rock,,"Whenever I go out with other married couples, I like to bring along a single crackhead. Just to spice things up."
Chris Rock,"girlfriends,hate","Women hate women. You get any two girlfriends in this room, been girlfriends for twenty five years, you put a man in between them … ""fuck that bitch,"" ""fuck that bitch."""
Chris Rock,,"You know the only thing you can do to stop your man from cheating? The only thing you can do … is be there. Where? There! Wherever he's thinking about fucking, that's it. Just be right there. And even then he still might lose your ass. He's like, ""Honey, look! A Sale! Let me go fuck this bitch right now!"""
Chris Rock,women,Do you know? What the fuck do women want? l know what you want: everything.
Chris Rock,,Only a woman can make you feel wrong for doing something right.
Chris Rock,,"You cannot win in a fight against women, cause men have a need to make sense."
Chris Rock,,Movies have takes. But plays are like life - you don't really get takes.
Chris Rock,,"You know, some people say life is short and that you could get hit by a bus at any moment and that you have to live each day like it's your last. Bullshit. Life is long. You're probably not gonna get hit by a bus. And you're gonna have to live with the choices you make for the next fifty years."

Chris Tucker,,"You loan your friend money. You see them again, they don't say nothin' 'bout the money. 'Hi, how ya doin'? How's ya mama doing?' Man, how's my money doin'?"

Chris Tucker,,I love to talk about people I've met being an entertainer. All my encounters in life - I roll it all into an hour and 30 minutes.
Chris Tucker,,I told a joke and people laughed and it was the best feeling. I knew I wanted to do this as a career. I never knew I could get such a high from telling a joke. There’s something so extraordinary about having people listening to you and hanging onto your words - it’s a great feeling.

Chris Tucker,,"Jackie come to me and says, 'We gonna do a fight scene.' I said 'What?' He says 'We got to do a fight scene in the next scene. I have to teach you.' I say 'How you gonna teach me in three seconds?' What we did, we did the fight scene with our arms connected."
Chris Tucker,government,"We can only comment on what we've seen, and what we've seen from the Chilean government is nothing at all."
Chris Tucker,,"You see people waving. You don't see people having problems, with each other at least."
Chris Tucker,,"What!? You tell people that, I won't get no more black movies?"
Chris Tucker,,"I like LA. LA is cool, but it ain't like home. Atlanta is home. All my friends are here, I grew up here. But LA is cool. Its more like a big office. Its work and you work, and you're meetin' people all the time, but its more like acquaintances than friends and stuff.I wanted to cut down on the profanity, because I think I'm funnier without sayin' a lot of cuss words."
Chris Tucker,,You got to control your own destiny. You got to keep writin different stuff. Keep switchin up and never do the same thin too many times.
Chris Tucker,,They came out very prepared and we missed lot of tackles. We have to start on Monday and watch the film. I kept asking what was happening. They just out-competed us.
Chris Tucker,problems,"Making people laugh is giving, and it's healing, too, when people can go up to the movies and forget about their problems. It's a good thing. That's why I want to work."
Chris Tucker,,"I want to keep working, I want to keep doing my humanitarian stuff around the world, shining light on different places that have problems. Keep making movies, make people laugh."
Chris Tucker,,"I think real life reflects your movies. In your life, you pick stuff that influences what movie roles you wanna pick. I think if you've got an interesting life, you wanna do interesting movies about interesting things."
Chris Tucker,,"I love traveling. It not only opens my mind up, but it also allows me to use my fame in another way through humanitarian works and stuff, and being an influence around the world."
Chris Tucker,,"I feel like every time I go out, I want to do a good job. I want people to say that he's just as good at stand-up as he is in some of the movies I've seen him in, so I try to do the best every time I go out there."
Chris Tucker,opportunities,"Georgia was a great place to live, but I wanted to get out because I knew the opportunities for what I was doing - stand-up comedy and eventually acting - were in Los Angeles."
Chris Tucker,,"Comedy comes from a place of hurt. Charlie Chaplin was starving and broke in London, and that's where he got his character 'the tramp' from. It's a bad situation that he transformed into comedic one."
Chris Tucker,,"When you're first starting out, you want to keep making good movies. When you're young and you're black, you do a bad movie and you're through."

Chris Tucker,,"I've been fortunate to work with good directors who understand improvisation and understand the way comedians work. Luke Basan let me do my thing like do what you feel and take the character to another level. Quentin Tarrantino was more of an acting coach. He can teach you beats and then hell say go with it but give this feeling. So I've been fortunate to work with good, seasoned directors."
Chris Tucker,asians,I am now half Asian. I have learned all the ancient teachings of Buddi.
Chris Tucker,,"Wow! Lee, we got a big ass problem."
Chris Tucker,audience,"Everybody goes through a lot of the same things, and I talk about those, and that's the key. You have to connect with your audience, and I might take them on a trip with me, tell them I went here and I went there and they'll go with me, you know, to hear the stories."
Chris Tucker,,My mom raised me to never have anything control me.

Chris Tucker,,I do a lot of traveling around the world.
Chris Tucker,,"Day-to-day life is a lot of work. I work a lot on stand-up stuff, and then day-to-day life and, you know, just living. It's always different. Try to work out, try to stay in shape, and try to have some fun."
Chris Tucker,,"I've got a big closet of scripts, and a big stack of scripts on the side of my desk, because you get a whole bunch. Nothing's going to be perfect, and I realize that; but I am a perfectionist, so you go through a lot of stuff."

Chris Tucker,,"It’s funny because when I was younger my voice would rise when I would talk on the microphone. Now it is sort of like a character for me, a more animated version of myself and my voice is 10 times up from my regular self."
Chris Tucker,weed,"Weed is from tha earth. God put this here for me and you. Take advantage man, take advantage!"
Chris Tucker,,"It's crazy because people expect you to be funny all the time and every day is not a funny day. I go to funerals and people are like 'tell a joke' and 'say one of your lines in a movie.' It's a funeral, man!"
Chris Tucker,,We're certainly going to fight for a reasonable amount of money.

Christian Finnegan,,"If I could go back and talk to the ""me"" who was just starting to do comedy, I would have told myself to relax and not worry about things happening right away. That’s a mistake a lot of people make - they think a year is a long time and it’s really not."
Christian Finnegan,,"What people really want is not to make something funny, but to make something amusing - which, in many ways, is the opposite of funny. To amuse someone is to eliminate discomfort and awkwardness, kind of like a massage for the brain, while to be funny is to point out awkwardness and discomfort. Everyone thinks they want funny, but they really want amusement."
Christian Finnegan,,"Basically, I got into stand-up because I’m too egocentric to be an actor and not disciplined enough to be a writer."
Christian Finnegan,"happiness,embarrassment","I certainly do believe that a lot of comedy comes from awkwardness and embarrassment - pointing out the ways things are uncomfortable. Definitely the stuff that interests me. I don’t necessarily think that comedy comes from a dark place, like you have to be a strung-out heroin addict. But I don’t think it comes from happiness, that’s for sure. It comes from frustration and suppressed rage, and wishing the world were different."
Christian Finnegan,,"Jeez, you'd think the people in this bank had never seen someone playing castanets before."
Christian Finnegan,intelligence,"The thing is - I'm not an idiot. I'm rather intelligent, as proven by the fact that I just used the word 'rather' in a sentence."
Christian Finnegan,,"Do me a favor, guys. Don't drink so much that you become the guy that goes into the bathroom and moans while taking a leak. See, the women in the room, they might not know what we're talking about; every dude knows."
Christian Finnegan,,"Do you guys remember that woman who disappeared a few years ago, Chandra Levy? Do you remember her? I found this fascinating. Apparently, the day she disappeared, she had gone on her computer, and the last website she ever visited was an online map of the park where her body was found. That's true. I just hope that if I ever disappear, people don't look for me based on the last websites I visited."
Christian Finnegan,,You were born on April Fool’s Day because you’re a dick.
Christian Finnegan,,"I knew the minute I met my wife, I looked at her and said, 'Oh my God, that is the woman I'm going to spend the next four to seven years with.'"
Christian Finnegan,,"I'm working on something a little different. It's a technique I call, 'tantric abstinence.' Now, the way this works is I meet a woman, I charm the heck out of her, and then right as she's considering sleeping with me, I say something so awkward that she leaves and I have to start over again with another woman entirely."
Christian Finnegan,,Some of you guys must have real jobs - office jobs. Anybody? By a show of broken spirits.

Christian Finnegan,,Basically Britney Spears' video is like a three an a half minute version of Glitter.
Christian Finnegan,,I think it's really funny watching all the people that have been booted off The Apprentice trying to pretend as if they respect the two guys that are still there. They obviously think these two guys are jackasses.
Christian Finnegan,,"Nothing will rob you of what little testosterone you do have like crawling into a bed with a chihuahua. As a guy you could be wearing a Hello Kitty backpack, carrying dandelions and licking a penis-shaped lollipop and that, my friends, would be one third as gay as waking up in the morning to find you and a chihuahua are spooning."
Christian Finnegan,,"I think I speak for America when I say, ""nothing says NASCAR like Whoopi Goldberg."""
Christian Finnegan,,"After nearly killing herself, Kristy Yamaoka has been whipping through the talk show circuit at a break-neck pace."
Christian Finnegan,,"People might say, ""What's so great about the Arctic Monkeys? I've never even seen them."" Well, you've never seen God either. You're gonna tell me he's not awesome?"
Christian Finnegan,,"This documentary is so sexy, it puts the sex back in quantum phy-sex."
Christian Finnegan,,"Canada, or as i call them, America Light."
Christian Finnegan,,The Smurf village was destroyed weeks ago and Bush has still not made an appearance. George Bush doesn't care about tiny blue people.
Christian Finnegan,,"I hope that if I ever disappear, people don't look for me based on the last websites I visited. Kind of an awkward press conference for my parents. ""Officer, do you have any leads?"" ""Well, based on Mr. Finnegan's computer entries, we think he was abducted by Sorority Sluts."""
Christian Finnegan,motivation,Pimp stands for Positive Intellectual Motivated Person. It has nothing to do with selling sex for money.

Christian Finnegan,,"If you purchased the latest Joss Stone CD, what you're saying is that you're an employee of VH1."
Christian Finnegan,"help,weed","What is the point of a car alarm if it doesn't get people out of their beds to come help you? So if I ever have a car alarm - if I ever have a car - it's just going to be a big speaker on the back of my car. And when anybody tries to break in, it's just gonna go: ""Attention! Free bags of weed! Come get your free bags of weed!"""
Christian Finnegan,politics,"The thing is, I hate political comedy. I personally loathe it."
Christian Finnegan,,"As a general rule, I’ll talk about anything, provided it’s funny. But some topics - disease, famine, Big Daddy Kane - have a slightly higher threshold for how funny an idea must seem for me to try it onstage."
Christian Finnegan,fitness,"I joined a gym recently. I don't have the best history in the world of sticking with my fitness regimens, but I feel like this time's gonna be different. I figure one of two things is gonna happen: either I'll get into shape, or I'll just resign myself to paying an $85 a month fat tax."
Christian Finnegan,,You know what I'm great at? Trivial Pursuit. What good is that gonna do you in life? It has the word 'trivial' in the name. The game is basically telling you that you pursue trivial things. Trivial - as in not important. Trivial - as in maybe you should've gone to grad school.
Christian Finnegan,"dogs,aggression,douchebags","I love dogs because there's no filter mechanism between the dog's brain and its tail. There's no filter there. Like, if the dog is happy, the tail is wagging; if the tail is wagging, the dog is happy. There's no passive aggressive shit like humans, like, ""Oh this douchebag thinks I'm happy to see him""."
Christian Finnegan,,I'm not an alcoholic. I just drink that way.
Christian Finnegan,hollywood,"Jesus is a powerful guy in Hollywood. Not quite as powerful as Vin Diesel, but powerful."

Christian Finnegan,,"I was told by a physician to avoid any line of work where people need to, um, depend on me for anything."
Christian Finnegan,respect,"I really respect peple who try. People who say, ""No, I’m actually going to do the best I can."" That said, you want to do the best you can while remaining who you are."
Christian Finnegan,"intelligence,business","There are two kinds of intelligence in this world. People who are Monopoly smart and people who are Trivial Pursuit smart... If you’re starting your own business, don’t even talk to me. But If you need to know who the lead singer of Kajagoogoo is, I’m your guy. His name is Limahl, by the way."
Christian Finnegan,,There comes a point where the disappointments in your life accrue faster than you can find external forces to blame them on.
Christopher Titus,"brain,marijuana","Well, honey, she's brain dead. Her brain doesn't work anymore.' 'You mean like Uncle Rudy?' 'No, honey, Uncle Rudy's on Thorazine. And Paxil. And marijuana. And merlot.'"
Christopher Titus,,"At the millennium we partied like it was 1999. And then we had a 10 year bathtub tequila hangover, man. Just hugging the metaphorical toilet on a daily basis."
Christopher Titus,terrorists,"Let's define ""terrorist organization."" A terrorist organization is an organization that makes you feel scared all the time and makes you change your behavior. What does CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC do all the time? That's right. Wolf Blitzer? Terrorist. Glenn Beck? Terrorist. Nancy Grace? Terrorist. And her plastic surgeon. The only news organization that is not a terrorist organization is the BBC. Because the BBC can make the worst things sound okay. ""Hello, welcome to the BBC. Satan has re-entered the planet. He is picking up babies with his talons, ripping off their heads, and sucking out their souls. We're in for a thousand years of darkness, all hope is lost and now, the World Cup update."""

Christopher Titus,,"Girls mature faster than boys. Yeah, a chick came up with that."
Christopher Titus,violence,"Screwed-up people settle fights through violence. This can escalate into a war that can kill millions. Normal people settle disputes over cookies, cakes, and pies. Normal people are fat."
Christopher Titus,soulmates,"Everybody has hope for the perfect love. Normal people are raised to believe that there's someone out there who's your soulmate, your best friend, your lover. My dad always told me that when you find that person, ""You gotta nail her""!"
Christopher Titus,hitler,"Death, is good. If it's someone you don't like. Oh, c'mon! Vlad the impaler, I mean Hitler's dead, woohoo! No matter heinous someone is, remember, there's always a chance that deputy from Barstow will find their body in the desert rolled up in charred carpet."
Christopher Titus,soulmates,"There's a one in six billion chance you'll find your soul mate. And that's if they're not dead. At best they're probably living in some Siberian ice cave eating bugs and weaving beads into their back hair. But they're out there. My dad believed that to find your perfect soul mate, first, you had to look through a bunch of other guys' soul mates."
Christopher Titus,,"Normal people, fear the day their parents die. Screwed up people, fear the day their parents kill. My mum killed a guy, at my wedding. So I can pretty much check that off. But, she's my mum. And no matter what she did I just can't walk away from her. She gave me birth. She gave me love. She gave me the ability to make a cigarette fire look like it was started by the hot water heater."
Christopher Titus,,"Lady, if you laugh and you don't make a noise, you're a shaker, and it's freaking me out."
Christopher Titus,"shoes,cancer","Osama's dead. Why is the terror alert ""elevated"" or ""imminent""? Why not ""chill""? Can't I just fly, keep my shoes on and avoid X-ray-fueled testicular cancer?"

Christopher Titus,,France participates. Does anyone want to be France?
Christopher Titus,,"When I was seven, I watched ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" with my mom. When Jack Nicholson was strapped to the table getting electroshock treatment, my mom burst into tears. She said it reminded her of her life, and I was stunned, because I didn't know my mom had been nominated for an Oscar."

Well, he actually had three heart attacks and a heart ""episode."" Cause his last heart attack, he was with an HMO. Yes. And it seems that if they write down ""heart attack,"" they have to admit you. But if they write down ""heart episode,"" they can give you Robitussin and send your ass home."
Christopher Titus,"brain,diapers","If I am ever brain dead, kill Titus. If I cannot control the fluids spewing out of my own orifices, please kill Titus. If I'm not aware enough to pick which diapers I would like to be changed into, for God's sake, kill Titus - unless I'm really funny."
Christopher Titus,"racism,museums","Everybody's a racist. It's the one human trait that makes us all exactly the same. Deep down, we only like people who are exactly like us. And it doesn't matter. White. Black. Red. Yellow. Purple, uh oh, the purple people, are the worst. Man. All prejudiced and birth marky. But, we've got to learn to get past our differences. I learned that at the museum of tolerance. After my dad beat the crap out of a guy over a parking spot."
Christopher Titus,,"My mom had this inate ability. Whatever town my mother moved to, the second she walked into town, she would instantly attract the alpha loser of that town. This guy was not a good guy. This guy was half O.J. Simpson and half O.J. Simpson. Scott Peterson sprinkles on the top, a side of Robert Blake. You know, not a good guy."
Christopher Titus,,"I want to be cremated. Then I want to you to take the ashes, I want you to put them in a douche bottle, find a hooker, and run me through one more time. On my children, I did not write that. I am repeating it."
Christopher Titus,terrorists,"The Times Square Incident wasn't a terrorist attack, it was a Jim Carrey movie. The terrorist locked the keys to the safe house he was going to escape to in the carbomb. And I love that he locked the carbomb. ""Nobody's getting my Ipod."" Then he left the keys to carbomb hanging out of the tailgate of the carbomb, and built the carbomb out of fertilizer that wouldn't explode. I have been doing comedy for 25 years and I have never been that funny."
Christopher Titus,,"Valentines Day is a day we celebrate real love. A love so strong that two hearts become one. Yeah, when you're happy, she's happy. And when you're angry, she's angry. And when you start wallowing in self-pity because your hotrod shop tanks and everybody's against you so you start drinking. And then she moves out and goes and lives with her parents, pfft. Or was that the day after Valentines Day? Doesn't matter. I'll go get another one just like her."
Christopher Titus,,"So what if your custom car shop tanks and you've gotta take a crappy job at an auto parts store, dealing with ignorant, pushy people. I'm okay with that, 'cause I'm an ""ignorant, pushy people"" person."
Christopher Titus,,"Humans are born, small, weak and helpless. That's why we have family. And the elders of the family are the honoured guardians of our country's history. Unfortunately, in America, we, you know, lock those elders away out of view in nursing homes and go about our little lives. It's a great national shame and an irredeemable tragedy. Oh well."
Christopher Titus,,"If you want something bad enough, you've got to make a bold move. Just make sure you clear the bold move with the people whose lives it's going to affect. Like George Washington, had to get all those guys who the British killed to agree to die. Neil Armstrong, had to crank a couple of elbows into Buzz Aldrin's face mask to make sure he got on the moon first. And Christopher Titus, well, he worked his dad for five grand. Ha ha. Who can't support who ? I know, it's complicated."
Christopher Titus,,"When you are a screwed up person, you have a responsibility to keep your normal friends from getting walked on. 'Cos, how bad could you screw that up ? And don't say, ""Well, you could cause someone six months of physical therapy."" 'Cos, hey, lots of times, those exercise take places in pools and nylon tents with little plastic balls. Fun places like that. And, she gets to park up really close for a while. Ha ha, oh, I'm the bad guy."
Christopher Titus,,"How far would you go for someone you love ? I heard this story, about this woman, who actually lifted a car off of her baby. 'Course I would have said, ""Dude! Back up."" But, wasn't my kid. When I was born, if I'd have known all the stuff my dad was going to do for me, I'd have crawled right back in."
Christopher Titus,,"How far would you go for someone you love ? Well, when my grandkids ask me how I pledged my love to their grandma, I'll say, I told her I would die for her, after I found out I didn't have an incurable disease. Then, I ran away while grandma was getting her ass kicked by a pregnant woman that grandpa slept with. You never know when you're making a memory."
Christopher Titus,,"What? No, dude, I did not try to bring down that plane. If I had tried to bring down that plane, that plane would have come down! "
Christopher Titus,,"My mum was crazy. And her mum was crazy. And her mum's mum was crazy. Is it my turn? Am I going to live the rest of my life giggling at raindrops, wearing paper slippers? When I go to dinner with friends should I not use a fork 'cause I just might snap? Hey, you guys look great. How's the baby?"
Christopher Titus,,"Life, is easy. And if someone is ripping your ass, maybe they're just trying to push you. To the peak of your ability. Until, one day, you reach a level that even you didn't think you were capable of. Stick around those people. 'cos, sometimes, when you think someone's screwing you, they're helping you. And then sometimes, they're just screwing you. Little bastard."
Christopher Titus,,"In a crisis, my family puts aside all its petty differences and hatreds... Because a crisis, is a perfect opportunity to create new petty differences and hatreds! My dad's from that era when you lived to 50, your heart exploded and that was that. You know when you cook bacon and you pour the grease into the can? My dad's the can!"
Christopher Titus,,"Fathers and sons are natural enemies. Look at any species. Shark, sees his father in the water, he's not thinking, ""Hey dad, wassup ?"" He's thinking, ""Back off, old man, this surfer carcass is mine."" Of course, when his girlfriend swims up and she's like, ""Way, you know, there's enough surfer for everybody. You and your dad need to frenzy together more. Leave you father a thigh."""
Christopher Titus,,"My dad's all I've ever had. When I was 3 and 4, my mom used to take me to bars. I understand why now - babysitters cost beer, beer and-a-half an hour."
Christopher Titus,,Everyone should think for themselves. I learned that in a book I bought called 'Everyone Should Think For Themselves'.
Christopher Titus,,Does anyone ever shudder with the crap that you pulled off and didn't die?
Christopher Titus,,"Without her I don't exist. Without her, I wouldn't be doing this for a living. Without her, in four states it would still be legal to kill a man with a cappuccino machine. She touched a lot of lives."
Christopher Titus,"husband,alcohol","And me having kids, with my family history? My mom: mentally ill, shot and killed her last husband. My father: six ex-wives, four heart attacks. Both of my parents think alcohol is a food group."
Christopher Titus,,"Osama Bin Laden is dead? Oh my God, that was so easy! And it only took two trillion dollars, two wars and too many good men."
Christopher Titus,,"I had a real job at fourteen years old. At seventeen, I was on my own. At twenty, I cut the liver out of a drifter and gave it to my father! 'Cause my dad's a drinker and I love my dad. And for eighty bucks, you can do anything in Mexico!"
Christopher Titus,,"If you're already so low on the parental totem pole, skill-wise, that you're letting your child scream ""frickin'"" in a public place... just let 'em say ""fuck."" He's already going to prison. Don't make him a bottom-bunk, too."
Christopher Titus,,"I have to warn you about tonight's show. Tonight's show will fix your relationship or destroy it. And either way, you're welcome."
Christopher Titus,,"I asked him one time to tell me how I was conceived. You know why? 'Cause I wanted one good story. I don't have any good stories. I have no romantic stories of my parents that don't end with this phrase: ""So the cops finally cuffed the crazy bitch."""
Christopher Titus,,"Dad finally had a defribillator implanted in his body. You know, ""Clear!"" He had a little one right here. Ironically, the size and shape of a cigarette pack, which used to crack me the fuck up, man. 'Cause he smoked for forty years, and now he's got a permanent little square right here.

Christopher Titus,holidays,"Thanksgiving is a holiday that brought together two different cultures. And things might not always work out like you think they should. But they always work out. I'm thankful that the world's in perfect harmony at all times. Pilgrims had it tough. But now, we live in the strongest, most prosperous country in the world. And the Indians, well, you know."
Christopher Titus,homeless,"In a normal family, surprise means presents, cake and a party. My family, surprise means homelessness, abandonment and destruction of private property. Sometimes we have cake. We're not losers."
Christopher Titus,,"Valentines Day is the day we celebrate real love. A love so strong that two hearts become one. And when she's happy, you're happy. And when she's angry, you can still choose to be happy, 'cos, what's her deal ? You know, I'm happy. Why is she bringing me down, you know ? Oh great, now look, I'm getting all mad. I hope she's happy. Happy Valentines Day."
Christopher Titus,"divorce,elvis presley","My dad got divorced six times. Well, he actually only got divorced five times.

Dad, your last marriage was performed in Reno by an ordained lesbian Elvis impersonator. Who you hit on."
Christopher Titus,husband,"I believe life is about balance. My mom was brilliant, yet manipulative. Beautiful, but had more voices in her head than the Wu-Tang Clan. Loves her kids, killed her last husband. I say ""last husband"" because you don't get another one after that."
Christopher Titus,,"Of course, here's the weird part. After I fought my dad, all of a sudden we're buddies now. Like he's my friend now, we start hanging out. But we're still the same people. So we'd go out on Sunday, you know, and just be hanging out, then he'd, like, pick a guy, and we'd just go beat the crap out of that guy as a team. Memories, huh?"
Christopher Titus,,My dad's full of encouragement and support. It just feels like abandonment and neglect.
Christopher Titus,,A salamander can grow a new tail in three weeks. My dad can score new tail in three minutes.
Christopher Titus,,"Dad is a new person. A person who has learned that forgiveness is better then revenge. Next year, we'll teach him that heart attacks are not like women. You just can't keep having them!"
Christopher Titus,truth,My dad don't like lies. He says it hurts people in the long race. He prefers the truth. That hurts them instantly.
Christopher Titus,,"My father thrives on fear. You know that prayer ""If I should die before I wake""? I had sheets that said that!"
Christopher Titus,holidays,"Thanksgiving is a holiday that brought together two different cultures. The pilgrims came here with the best intentions. They decided to flee an oppressive people and move to a new land. Where they thrived. And became an oppressive people. You get certain people on the same continent, there's going to be a problem. Pilgrims and Indians. Protestants, Catholics. My family, anybody else's family."
Christopher Titus,,"Your father. He loves you. But, he doesn't like you. And why should he ? Huh ? Ever since you were born, he's had less money, less sex, less time, less stuff. You eat his food. You wear his clothes. You don't give him his messages. And look, you're his son. You suck."
Christopher Titus,worth,"Your father loves you. But, he doesn't like you. His job is to tell you you suck and are worthless so that when you get out there on your own you don't end up sucking worthlessly. He makes you a better man so that one day you will have the strength and character to stand up to him. And give him the finger. But just pray on that day he doesn't have the strength and character to break that finger off. Ow. I thought he was sleeping."
Christopher Titus,,"We've lost our way, I thin. We keep waiting for a wizard to fix it. You know, the Democrats and Republicans - they're not going to fix it. That's just Coke and Pepsi - same crap, different can."
Christopher Titus,,"I find that Americans are all in the middle somewhere, except for the extreme nuts, and extreme nuts on both sides are the loudest. And that's why it feels like we are polarized."

Christopher Titus,,"I can't stop some idiot from crashing into a building or blowing up a bus, I can only be your dad and give you a few pure truths. Number one, duct tape will save your life. Number two, Tupac is alive, but I need you to keep that on the DL because of Suge. And number three, don't be afraid of anything - except the television news because they're lying to you every night."

Christopher Titus,,"I finally stopped drinking when I hit seventeen years old. Yes, imagine the fuckup I must have been. Stopped drinking because it isn't really good for your health... and I fell into a bonfire! Yeah, you're done drinking then. You don't need AA. Falling into a bonfire is a one-step program."
Christopher Titus,doctors,"My father never missed a drink in his life. Or a joint. Or a party. Or a chance to get laid. He also never missed a day of work, or a house payment, or a car payment. I never went hungry, although he did a couple of times so I wouldn't. This is a man who survived four heart attacks. The doctors revoked his organ donor card and issued him a ""Hazardous Waste"" decal."
Christopher Titus,arguments,"She had a little quirk! A little glitch. We’d get into an argument, I would present my side of the argument. Her retort would invariably be to... punch me in the face."
Christopher Titus,,"The only thing that ever made me want to be a wife-beater is being called one. ""Your honor, can I have five minutes to make her not a liar, please?"""

Christopher Titus,sisters,"My mom was a manic depressive schizophrenic who, after a year in prison, went home and shot herself. My sister, Kirsten, an amazing poet, who was raised by this woman, and was dating a guy who broke up with her for the fourth time in three weeks. And one day, she came to his house, got a gun, and blew her brains out all over his headboard. I just went through a divorce, five years in court and cost me $2 million dollars. If anyone, by law, should be forced to take antidepressants it's me... But instead, I choose to be an antidepressant. And you can take me with alcohol."
Christopher Titus,,"When you're born, you're pure. Unspoiled and trusting. Some say, it's the only time we're perfect. You're also born covered in blood and placenta. No one gets nostalgic about that."
Christopher Titus,,"Thomas Jefferson said, ""The tree of liberty must be fertilized from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."" Yeah and I heard that and thought, ""I'm out!"""
Christopher Titus,divorce,"My dad also survived five divorces, and the women he married cleaned his ass out every time. I used to think my dad got divorced because he wanted new furniture. At one point in my life, all we had left was a wooden box, a 12"" black-and-white TV, and a four-man rubber raft for a couch. And yet, I was the coolest kid in third grade. ""Mom, can we have a sleepover in Christopher Titus' house? They have a raft in the living room! We can row to breakfast in the morning. I can actually be Captain Crunch!"""
Christopher Titus,,"The towers fell, and the first thing that went through my head was my dad's voice: 'Well, you brought a new life into the world, and the world's over. Nice timing, numbnuts!'"
Christopher Titus,,Anyone look back at their high school career and just shudder at what you got away with and didn't die?
Christopher Titus,,"I have a hot wife, I know that, because every guy that meets her, when she leaves the room, turns to me and goes ""Dude, man, if you die... I'm gonna be all over that!"" ""Thanks, dad."""
Christopher Titus,,"Being a parent is a life sentence. From the day that kid is born until the day you die. And then some. Mum, there is nothing to forgive. You gave me life. And, hey, you're not crazy anymore. Everybody thinks I am. Real funny, mum."
Christopher Titus,,"Blood doesn't make you family. Hell, an only child can bleed. It's the sharing of pain that makes you family. 'Cause, you can't really love a brother or sister until you know that they're as scarred and broken as you are. And, hey, if you grow up with a father like mine and you aren't at least a little scarred and broken, well then, that's not your father. You were spawned by an entirely different guy."
Christopher Titus,alcohol,"Dad thinks vengeance is the coolest thing about the Lord. That, and turning water into alcohol."
Christopher Titus,,"Vengeance, is good. It's what separates us from the animals and the daisies. But, you need something really bad to take vengeance for. Like, your girl friend hogs the chocolate milk. No. But, your girl friend drags you into therapy and lets your family secretly watch while you weep, well, I think even the daisies want to kick a little girl friend ass. And, the worst part about it, is that she apologised. Gave me a back rub and we had the best sex we ever had. What kind of manipulative crap is that?"
Christopher Titus,,"Vengeance, is good. You give it, you get it. It's all part of what makes us human. So thank god for vengeance. Otherwise, the human race might as well just roll over and let another species for a while. I think it will be the cats. Watch 'em. They're cooking up something."
Christopher Titus,,I don't fail. I succeed at finding what doesn't work.
Christopher Titus,,Don't puss out on me now!

Christopher Titus,shoes,"Normal people, fear the day their parents die. Screwed up people, fear that their parents are going to live forever. Showing up at your house at weird hours of the night, smelling all funny, with a bunch of their friends. ""Hey boy, this is Harold, Cecil and Dicky. Dicky lost his wife about a year ago. I hear Erin made cookies. Where can I put my shoes ?"" If that doesn't scare you, you're not human."
Christopher Titus,,"Normal people, who grow up with compassion, never amount to anything. They're the ones who end up gluing those little dots on the highway. Or, putting glue on the dots for the guy who glues dots on the highway. Screwed up people, who weren't coddled or raised with compassion, we get stuff done. Sure, we feel a little alone and abandoned, but, we're... very... happy. Why can't you love me, daddy?"
Christopher Titus,,"All of Dad's relationships ended exactly the same: subpoena, beep of a moving van backing up the driveway, pile of his clothes burning on the front lawn."
Christopher Titus,,"God bless America. But God, please help Canada."
Christopher Titus,,I do not need help destroying my relationship. I was raised by my father. I've completed a thirty-year seminar on the power of destroying relationships.

Christopher Titus,dreams,I have a dream! Because I have lived a nightmare.
Christopher Titus,,You don’t give out trophies for losing. Trophies for sucking. That’s a communist idea. You don’t get a trophy for losing. You get a piece of pizza and you shut up. Trophies for losing? What the hell happened to us?
Christopher Titus,,"Sometimes, to help someone you love, you have to commit a felony. But, you don't want to go to prison for that. ""Hey, dude, what are you in for? Armed robbery? Murder?"" And then, you have to say, ""Love."" And, that's definitely going to get you, you know, picked last for prison kick ball."
Christopher Titus,"society,worth","Nobody's really happy. And as soon as society realises that you can't trust anyone and that hardship is a natural part of existence, the sooner the therapists will realise that they are worthless! Sorry. They have worth deficit disorder!"
Christopher Titus,,"My father, never chooses me for anything. If you needed a kidney and I offered him mine, well, pfft. Well, he'd take it 'cos he was dying. It's not that he doesn't love me, 'cos he does. It's just that special kind of love that feels like neglect."
Christopher Titus,,"When you're born, you're pure. Unspoiled and trusting. I believed everything and everyone. Then, I met my parents!"

Christopher Titus,,"Being a teenager is the worst thirty years of your life. Peer pressure, acne, final exams, seven little tiny hairs on your upper lip. Luckily, the girls never noticed your infantile moustache, 'cos they were hyptonised by the fire engine sized zit on your forehead."
Christopher Titus,,"Being a teenager is the worst thirty years of your life. But it all changes after that. You get a great car, a great job. You got a wife, kids, you got your health. But then your company is sold out from under you, your stocks tank, your wife's sleeping with the gardener and your teenage daughter is pregnant. And you notice that you have a prostate so hard, you can actually take a hammer to it. But hey, not one zit."
Christopher Titus,,"Losing builds character. So, if you're the loser in your family, don't worry. 'Cos twenty years form now, that perfect can do no wrong brother of yours is going to show up at your house, bald, fat, divorced, with six kids who all hate him and he's going to ask you for money. And because of your character, you're going to look him right in the eyes and you're going to say, ""You know what, I'll give you some money. If you mow my lawn and detail my car. Oh yeah, then you can shampoo the tail."" Loser."

Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, ""Poker Face""? This stuttering, growling midget with a speech impediment is music? Really? This vapid, pop cancer, Madonna mini-me? She makes Miley Cyrus look like John Lennon. She makes Jack Lemon look like John Lennon. I'm sorry. And you don't get to claim you're not accepted at a billion hits on YouTube.

Christopher Titus,violence,My random acts of violence weren't random. They were premeditated.
Christopher Titus,shoes,"My mum was crazy. And when you're the child of a mentally ill person you spend your entire life waiting for the other shoe to drop. Living in fear that you also might be mentally ill. And the only way to defeat that fear, is to face it head on. Now, the opposite of fear is not courage. It's faith. You got to have faith that you will never end up like your parents. You also got to have faith that you will kick that crazy Korean kids ass in the day room ping pong show down. That's right, Kim Cho. Bring it on, I got something for you. Okay. Okay. One, nothing. Kim is out of his mind, but he is really good."

Christopher Titus,acceptance,"Normal people, want to be accepted. Screwed up people, want to be accepted. It's one of the few things we have in common. My whole life, all I ever wanted was my dad to pat me on the top of the head and go, ""Who's a good boy ? Who's a good boy?"" But, instead, all he ever did was wipe peanut butter on the end of my nose and laugh while I tried to lick it off."
Christopher Titus,acceptance,"Normal people, want to be accepted. Screwed up people do too. Oh, we made the cover. But any press is good press. Right ? As long as they spell your name right. So now the whole world is gonna read about... Tatus High Performance. Tatus. Great."

Next time a country wants to take us on, 'stead of sending bombs, let's try this: send everyone in the country a color television and a satellite dish. And give 'em the basic package, not HBO - screw those people. And before the war starts, we make them all sit down. ""Okay, we'll go to war with you. You want a piece of us, fine, fine. Before we go, I want you guys to understand us a little better, so you have to sit down and watch ESPN2 for 24 hours.

Christopher Titus,,"I gave my father a heart attack. It was a practical joke. Come on, you push a guy's face in a cake he's got to clean it off.

Christopher Titus,alcohol,"I say a twenty-two year window 'cause you wanna make sure the kid can handle his alcohol. You know, he's a great kid 'till his 21st birthday, gets drunk, punches Grandma and everyone's like ""Ohhhh! Adam! You were this close! We are gonna miss you!"""

Christopher Titus,,"Blood... does not make you family. In fact, blood just links your DNA to the scene of their crime. A real brother is a guy you can pin down and dangle a two ounce loogie that far over his face. So, that at the very last second, you suck it back in. Or you don't. That's what makes family. Phlegm."
Christopher Titus,,"Nobody's really happy. We used to be, before the psychologists made everything a syndrome. Or a dis-order. Before then, you weren't obsessive compulsive. You were, clean.

Christopher Titus,,"Being a parent is a life sentence. You see, that's why normal people should not have children. Because, if you raise a kid with only love and support, I guarantee that kid will be in rehab by the time he is sixteen. Why ? Because you never introduced him to mister back-of-your-hand. You know why I only broke into a liquor store once ? 'Cos my father introduced me to mister back-of-his-hand. And it's wiley side-kick. Mister foot-in-my-ass."

So no matter the volume of fussing you fuss or the wide angry streams of cussing you cuss, your fate is sealed when in mussing you muss with the nastiest of nasties, the Kenge. Well, Ken Titus."
Christopher Titus,soulmates,"There's a one in six billion chance you're gonna find your soul mate. But, maybe, your perfect soul mate is actually three or four half perfect people. How far are you willing to go to actually find that perfect somebody... ies. If you're not willing to make a group of people your soul mate then you'd better plan on being alone. You'll always have television."
Christopher Titus,john lennon,"My mum is in a mental hospital. There's a fine line between genius and insanity. Winston Churchill, Mozart, John Lennon.

Christopher Titus,"dating,jail,california","When you screw up, you got to pay the price. Shoot up a supermarket, you go to jail.

Of course, you know, I'm speaking metaphorically. My dad will push you in front of any bus."

Christopher Titus,,"My father? A hard drinking man from the 70's. We actually have no pictures of my dad where he is not holding a beer. Weddings, Funerals, Water Skiing, Parent-Teacher Conference. When I got sick around him as a kid growing up, he'd always warm me up a shot of 100 proof whiskey. Never got sick... that I can remember."
Christopher Titus,,"A lot of people tell me this, too: ""Don't worry about it. It's God's will. Y'know, you weren't meant to be together. God's will."" God's will? Really, God got involved in this? Really? Twenty years with somebody, twenty years of my life pretty much gone? All the money I made, the career I chose, pretty much torn to pieces? Two little kids' lives shattered? Really, God? Is that how you work? This brutal, disemboweling nightmare… is you? 'Cause if that's the case, then there is no God. And God said unto me: ""Christopher...

Well, it's possible my mom could stand up in front of this many people and talk about all the crap in her life and those people could have sat around and laughed with her, it would've meant nothing and she could have moved on cool.

Christopher Titus,,"Japan is the perfect example of make plans, and watch God laugh."
Christopher Titus,,"Everybody I’ve ever met was destroyed by a member of the opposite sex early on and that damage you took into every relationship after that, everybody.

Every guy here had a woman sleep with his best friend, now your new girlfriend hugs your cousin a little long, boom car bomb."

Christopher Titus,waitresses,Shot down by a twenty-two year old waitress in breakaway panties!
Christopher Titus,,"This country you’re sitting in right now was not built on love, hugs, time-outs and trophies you didn’t earn. This country was built on shame, humiliation and striving to be better. By the way, if you’re in this room right now and you’re successful… you didn’t get there because someone loved you too much or gave you too many hugs or you got a trophy when you lost.

Or, your parents gave you the money."
Christopher Titus,,"So it seems that because of every syndrome and disorder we've invented in the past twenty years, the Los Angeles Times reported that 63% of American families are now considered dysfunctional.

Christopher Titus,,"I am a patriot, and I protest speed limits by exceeding them."
Christopher Titus,,"In a normal family, a surprise means presents, cake and a party. For me ? I had no idea. And my family, doing something nice is seen as an attack.

Christopher Titus,problems,"Normal people terrify me, because they haven’t had enough problems in their life to know how to handle problems when they come up. Something little happens and they snap. But being from a disfunctional family means nothing rattles me. Hey once you’ve driven a drunken father to moms’ parole hearing, what else is there?"
Christopher Titus,husband,"My mom shot and killed her last husband. Yeah, my dad used to say ""Hey, dodged that bullet. Ha ha."""

Christopher Titus,,Clint Eastwood doesn't moisturize! But Clint Eastwood needs to moisturize!

A bunch of people living there, too old to be kids, but never gonna be adults... You can tell that by the ""AEROSMITH ROCKS"" banner in the living room window... Four sociopathic pitbulls roaming the yard at all times... The brown one has one leg, just flops to the fence every couple of hours... You can tell when the family's doubled their net worth 'cause they parked a new gutted Chevelle in the driveway... The mailman's afraid to bring the mail, so he just gives it to the cops, 'cause hell, they're gonna be there anyway... And if you don't recognize this house in your neighborhood, you live in this house in your neighborhood."
Christopher Titus,divorce,"I got divorced from my wife on June 6, 2006. Yeah, 6-6-06, which coincidentally, was when my wife turned into a demon spawned from Satan's anus. But for legal reasons, I have to call her, ""Kate."""

Colin Quinn,acceptance,"Humanity is a crazy contradiction. I accept us for who we are. We're not that great. Every time we take a step forward we go back to the same primitive behavior. We're meant to be this way. It's not our fault, it's just who we are."

Colin Quinn,,"People say ""history was written by the winners."" No, it wasn't. It was written by the bullies."
Colin Quinn,,The thing that drives me crazy is when comics say 'I have low self-esteem.' No you don't. You're standing on stage asking people to pay. You don't play an instrument. You want people to pay to hear what's in your mind. You don't have low self-esteem. You might have other problems.

Colin Quinn,,"I think if you try to tailor your act to anybody, you end up with an act that doesn't work anyway."

Colin Quinn,,"I'm just another guy who thinks he's smarter than he is, in a long line of them."

Colin Quinn,,"I've been to Japan, I've been to China, I've been to Africa, I've been to the Middle East, I've been to Europe a little bit. I've never been to South America."
Colin Quinn,,"If I had to give up everything else and keep just one aspect of the job, I'd have to keep writing because I love it. Yes, I enjoy performing, too. But I couldn't give up writing material."

Craig Ferguson,,He was in awe of the thirst that people had for someone to tell them that everything was going to be all right. He marveled at the gullibility and vulnerability of his fellow humans.

Craig Ferguson,,"Every day I ran to that book like it was a bottle of whiskey and crawled inside because it was a world that I had at least some control over, and slowly, in time, it began to take shape."
Craig Ferguson,alcohol,"Alcohol ruined me financially and morally, broke my heart and the hearts of too many others. Even though it did this to me and it almost killed me and I haven't touched a drop of it in seventeen years, sometimes I wonder if I could get away with drinking some now. I totally subscribe to the notion that alcoholism is a mental illness because thinking like that is clearly insane."
Craig Ferguson,criticism,"Some critics are saying that Palin won't last on Fox because she's an over-emotional woman who gets the facts wrong. But I disagree. It's working great for Glenn Beck, so she'll be fine."
Craig Ferguson,,I think we look back at times past with fondness because we were younger. Life had not yet begun pecking away at our innocence like buzzards on fresh road kill.

Craig Ferguson,,"According to a new study, Hawaii is the happiest place in America to live. And I thought it was just a great place to pretend you were born in."

Craig Ferguson,,"In honor of Earth Day, tonight’s program will be made up of 100 percent recycled jokes."
Craig Ferguson,judgment,"Every year there’s a jury at the Cannes Film Festival. Getting on the jury is very competitive in France. Not because the French love cinema, but because they love to judge."
Craig Ferguson,decisions,"With school out, teens are looking for jobs, things like lifeguards. But L.A. public pools do not have lifeguards. We have life coaches. If they see you struggling in the water, they say, “Are you happy with the decisions you’re making”? Then they give you a pamphlet for a yoga studio."
Craig Ferguson,,"""World War Z"" is out today. The big zombie movie. The trailer looks scary. You see hordes of bodies climbing and rolling over each other. It’s like Black Friday at the mall."
Craig Ferguson,,"Love at first sight is not rare, in fact it is extremely common, it happens to some people a few times a year. The feeling of ""what if"" when meeting the eyes of a stranger can be love unrecognized."
Craig Ferguson,,"There are plans for a new high-speed train between Los Angeles and San Francisco. It will make the trip time 30 minutes. People in L.A. are like, ""Yes!"" And people in San Francisco are like, ""Yeah, sure, great. We look forward to seeing you."""
Craig Ferguson,,"These days, young people watch TV on smartphones and computers. Young people with an actual TV set are harder to find than a picture of Anthony Weiner with his clothes on."
Craig Ferguson,animals,"It’s Earth Day today. Let me tell you something about polar bears. They’re endangered but you have to be careful because a polar bear is one of the few animals that will stalk a human. If you go to where polar bears live, it might stalk you and when you’re on the plane going home, it might be behind you reading."
Craig Ferguson,,My pilot's license. I'm proud of that.
Craig Ferguson,,"Sometimes, in order to follow one’s heart, one must do the wrong thing. Now, I’m not absolving anyone of their actions; you have to be responsible for your actions, sick or well, you have to be, you just have to be. All of us are accountable."
Craig Ferguson,"laws,driving,california","Here in California, we passed a law against texting while driving. But there’s no law preventing you from writing a letter while driving."
Craig Ferguson,,Canada is not the party. Its the apartment above the party.
Craig Ferguson,,"The Universe is very, very big. It also loves a paradox. For example, it has some extremely strict rules. Rule number one: Nothing lasts forever. Not you or your family or your house or your planet or the sun. It is an absolute rule. Therefore when someone says that their love will never die, it means that their love is not real, for everything that is real dies. Rule number two: Everything lasts forever."
Craig Ferguson,,I'm always a bit shy around evil people...
Craig Ferguson,"government,laws,prostitutes",The Afghan government is as corrupt as a prostitute with a law degree.

Craig Ferguson,,You know your heavy metal band's going to suck when you've got a clarinet player.
Craig Ferguson,audience,Here’s a tip for all you aspiring young comics: Don’t beat up the customers. It is very difficult to get laughs from an audience when you’ve actually drawn blood from one of their number. It kills the mood.
Craig Ferguson,,"You know, I think there's a good rule of thumb here: Don't take nutritional advice from other species."
Craig Ferguson,"laws,new york",A New York City judge struck down a proposed law to ban sodas larger than 16 ounces. I think Mayor Bloomberg should spend his time trying to improve stuff like education. New York needs a better education system if kids didn’t figure out they could get around the 16-ounce soda ban by simply purchasing two 12-ounce sodas.
Craig Ferguson,teachers,"I always appreciated my teachers. When I was 16, I gave them the greatest gift I could think of. I dropped out of school."
Craig Ferguson,baseball,There are nine Supreme Court members and nine people on a baseball team. Coincidence? Yes.
Craig Ferguson,,"Today Monopoly added a new game piece: the cat. The new piece was chosen after weeks of online voting. Is that a surprise? Whenever there’s a vote for something on the Internet, the cat always wins."
Craig Ferguson,,"Valentine’s Day is celebrated a little differently here in L.A. Nobody eats chocolate because of the calories, so people give each other tofu-shaped boxes filled with bean curd. Then they fantasize about what their Pilates instructor would be like if he was straight."
Craig Ferguson,,"The royal baby has a name now: George Alexander Louis. George is not the king yet. So for now, we just address him as ""Boy George."""

Craig Ferguson,devil,The devil is not abroad at night in the form of a cat or a wolf or any other animal. He lives eternally in the hearts of men.
Craig Ferguson,acceptance,"Allowances can always be made for your friends to disagree with you. Disagreement, vehement disagreement, is healthy. Debate is impossible without it. Evil does not question itself. Even the incorruptible are corruptible if they cannot accept the possibility of being mistaken."
Craig Ferguson,importance,I realize that I am not a journalist. So anything I say is not important.
Craig Ferguson,,Climate change is a serious problem. We all need to do what we can. Unless that means I’ve got to change stuff. Then I’m not doing it.

Craig Ferguson,,"Jimmy put in a word and told them that if I made it, I wouldn't be able to live with myself without paying them back. That I'd sooner die than owe anyone money for helping me. Apparently Jimmy knew more about me at that point than I knew about myself."
Craig Ferguson,"desire,emotions","High school is tough on anyone, an absolute rule of the Universe being that if high school is not a buttockclenchingly awkward, emotionally difficult, and unpleasant time of your life, then the rest of it will be a crushing disappointment. Academic success is desirable, popularity - the only thing that most students really desire - is not. Those who excel socially in high school are truly damned. The homecoming queen does indeed bear the mark of the beast."
Craig Ferguson,acceptance,People spend thousands of dollars trying to keep their teeth straight. I just hope we can live in a world where we accept gay teeth.
Craig Ferguson,,It's like a sort of internet Ren Fair. Its like Dungeons & Dragons but for cool people who have got friends.

Craig Ferguson,,"Bush's memoir is 512 pages. To be fair, 200 of those pages are just games and puzzles."
Craig Ferguson,,"Former president George W. Bush released his new memoir. By the way, 'memoir' is just a fancy word for 'a bunch of stuff that happened to me.'"
Craig Ferguson,,When you need to borrow money the Mob seems like a better deal I think. 'You don't pay me back I break both yer legs.' Is that all? You won't take my house or wreck my credit rating? Fine where do I sign. Legs? Fine. You don't even have to sign anything.
Craig Ferguson,,"Sometimes they would just pay me to stay home and not do anything else, which sounds fantastic but doesn't do much for your ego. Its probably a little like getting alimony-the money is nice but has a nasty aftertaste."
Craig Ferguson,"laws,acceptance",Even the incorruptible are corruptible if they cannot accept the possibility of being mistaken. Infallibility is a sin in any man. All laws can be broken and are. Often.

Craig Ferguson,,"I do a public access show with puppets. Puppets called actors, TV and movie stars."

Craig Ferguson,,"Aphrodisiacs come in many forms: food, drink, the internet..."

Craig Ferguson,,"It's a great day for Sarah Palin. She was hired as a commentator for Fox News. She signed a multi-year contract, which means she'll probably quit after a year."
Craig Ferguson,,There is a new bill in the Senate that is upsetting a lot of people. This bill would give the President the power to shut off the Internet. Al Gore is strongly opposed to it. Not because he invented the Internet. Because he did. But because he just signed up for Match.com.
Craig Ferguson,,"Did you hear about Mark Sanford, the governor of South Carolina? He mysteriously disappeared last week and nobody knew where he was. Today, Sanford admitted to having an affair in Argentina. I'm like, great, now we're outsourcing mistresses."
Craig Ferguson,,"Sarah Palin is speaking out about the oil spill. She said, I'm not kidding, we should ask the Dutch for help with the spill because the Dutch have the world's best dikes. So let me get this straight. It is OK to cover lesbians in oil but you just can't let them get married."
Craig Ferguson,politics,"My job is to find the politicians and the presidents and the pompous people who are telling other people how to live, powerful, visible creatures and... go at them."

Craig Ferguson,,"It's a great day for America, everybody! It's Monday, woo."
Craig Ferguson,,"You know, where I come from, an antique, to be called an antique, it has to be at least a hundred years old. That's a law: before you can call something an antique, it has to be a hundred years old. In L.A., something that's been around for a couple of weeks is an antique. It's true! People are like, ""Look at this old-fashioned iPod. Look at this! It's the size of a man's hand! Ha ha ha ha. Back then-back then, people thought Mel Gibson was just acting crazy. It was a very different time."""
Craig Ferguson,,"I think people are as individual as snowflakes, they kinda look alike but no two are the exactly the same, and all classification is the root of prejudice."

Craig Ferguson,,The queen banishes Snow White because of her beauty. But the dwarves help Snow White because they're smitten by that very beauty. It teaches kids an important lesson: Nothing matters except for your looks.

Craig Ferguson,,"The 3-D effects in ""Star Wars"" are so realistic, you can actually see George Lucas reaching from the screen and taking the money from your wallet."

Craig Ferguson,,"School did give me one of the greatest gifts of my life, though. I learned how to read, and for that I remain thankful. I would have died otherwise. As soon as I was able, I read, alone. Under the covers with a flashlight or in my corner of the attic - I sought solace in books. It was from books that I started to get an inkling of the kinds of assholes I was dealing with. I found allies too, in books, characters my age who were going through or had triumphed against the same bullshit."
Craig Ferguson,,There's something spiritual in hard work. Spirituality isn't all aromatherapy and scented candles.
Craig Ferguson,,"The nation of Iran is threatening to sue the makers of the movie ""Argo."" They say the movie was an unrealistic portrayal of their country. You can’t do that! That would be like Scotland suing over the movie ""Shrek."""
Craig Ferguson,,"A new study says by 2030 household robots will dominate every phase of our lives. The study says the No. 1 field for robot growth is medicine. That makes sense. Robots already perform well in surgery. That is, until there is a power outage. Then it’s just a coat rack leaning over you as you bleed to death."
Craig Ferguson,,"During the cold war, West Berlin was an ""exclave"" - a tiny outpost of liberalism surrounded by people who want to crush it. It was like Austin, Texas."

Craig Ferguson,,"I think I'll be Scottish in every movie I write. They always try to talk me out of it, but Woody Allen is always a nebbish New Yorker. Why shouldn't I be a goofy Glaswegian?"

Craig Ferguson,"decisions,dreams,emotions","America, for me, is a philosophical and emotional decision... It’s a flag and an idea. It’s a dream."
Craig Ferguson,obama,"The virus in the movie 'Contagion' is based on the bird flu which came out of nowhere back in 2008. Everyone thought it was going to change the way we live and it just faded away. Wait a minute, I'm talking about President Obama."
Craig Ferguson,"husband,hitler","Calling Angelina Jolie a husband stealer is like calling Hitler a vegetarian. It’s true, but it’s hardly the fuckin’ story, is it?"
Craig Ferguson,,"Like many of her sex, Sophie was fiercely competitive with other women, working on the crackpot theory that if she could be better in some way, men would like her more, respect her. Make her happy. She never cottoned on that the men she was attracted to, the men who found her attractive, didn’t like women."
Craig Ferguson,,"Lance Armstrong admitted he used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career. He confessed in front of the most respected judge in the land, Oprah Winfrey."
Craig Ferguson,"laws,desire","It takes a long time to become a lawyer because you need three things - a bachelor’s degree, a law degree, and a desire to worship Satan."

Craig Ferguson,,"This is a great day for people who do what I do, this is a great day for talk-show hosts. Remember when Dick Cheney shot his lawyer in the face? It's like one of those days.

Craig Ferguson,,"Like most sharks, Margaret liked to think of herself as a victim of the cruel sea."

However, there is one thing that the medical profession cannot do and that is save people from being idiots."
Craig Ferguson,,"I can't live by your rules, man!"
Craig Ferguson,rage,Another innocent victim of my pointless rage.
Craig Ferguson,"democracy,9/11","You don't say 'we're suspending the campaign'! You can't say that! We didn't sus-, you can't, it's the democratic process!

Craig Ferguson,,I just do my thing and try each show to be more honest about why I am and who I am. It's quite tricky and actually nerve-racking to do that. It's kind of a happy train wreck.

Craig Ferguson,,"So far rich people have been very quiet about the possibility of getting taxes raised on them, but that doesn’t mean they won’t get mad about it, it just means they don’t know about it. Because it takes a while for bad news to reach a rich person. First their accountant has to tell the butler, who has to tell the servant, who wouldn’t dare interrupt their game of croquet."
Craig Ferguson,,"I would prefer as a viewer to watch the mistakes. I am my own blooper reel, as it happens."
Craig Ferguson,,I don't want to be poor. I don't want to be rich to the extent that all I care about is keeping my job. I don't care enough about keeping my job right now. That's good.

Craig Ferguson,"democracy,dreams,politics","America truly is the best idea for a country that anyone has ever come up with so far. Not only because we value democracy and the rights of the individual, but because we are always our own most effective voice of descent... We must never mistake disagreement between Americans on political or moral issues to be an indication of their level of patriotism. If you don't like what I say or don't agree with where I stand on certain issues, then good. I'm glad we're in America, and don't have to oppress each other over it.

Craig Ferguson,divorce,"Larry King has been married more times than Henry the Eighth. We used to have that rhyme to keep track of them. 'Divorced, beheaded, died. Divorced, beheaded, survived.' With Larry I think it goes, 'Divorced, beheaded, divorced, escaped. Zombie, lesbian, disappeared, inflatable.'"

What if you could go somewhere, kill a hooker and her money could just float. You don't even need to pick it up you just walk through it and your body absorbs it.

And she's like, 'Quit calling me Britney Spears.' And I'm like, 'No one talks to The Rock like that, bitch!' Which is really funny because I don't have a girlfriend. That was just some lady on the bus - she did not smell what I was cooking."

A lot of people get to this level and they're like, ""Now I do four cities in one week"" and they tour nonstop. I'm like, ""No, that sounds miserable. I'll just do two weekends a month."" But whenever I'm in some awful place geographically, it's no longer that awful, because you've got the Internet and television."

Daniel Tosh,,"The floor is lava! That's the lava game, when you pretend that the floor is lava and you climb up on all the furniture. I see some of you don't get that. I don't care, that's okay.

Daniel Tosh,,"Go ahead, dumb people, be offended by a joke that doesn't have a plausible premise."
Daniel Tosh,"laws,immigration","I have no problem with illegal immigration in this country, except for the fact that they don't serve on jury duty. That's horse shit. It should be the other way around - they should serve exclusively on jury duty. Then it finally would be a jury of one's own peers. It's not a stereotype if it's always true; then it becomes law."

Then, I set the car alarm off: 'You hit the jackpot, mofo!'"

Don't stand too close or you'll get yellow stuff all over your bacon"" What? I see some of you holding your stomach and feeling: ""No, you shouldn't."" That's a breakfast joke.

Daniel Tosh,,"Somebody bought me a Snuggie as a joke gift. Haha, the joke's on you, I enjoy it. I toss and turn at night, finally a blanket that's like, 'I'm going to keep you warm.' It's like having a small child with polio keep you in a full nelson - the perfect pressure."
Daniel Tosh,,Big can be beautiful - just not to me. I find you disgusting; freshmen 15 is not a life sentence.
Daniel Tosh,pancakes,"No matter how flat you make your pancakes, it still has two sides."
Daniel Tosh,white people,I assume the only reason we have them is so that white people feel relevant in sports. Because other than that the only thing the winter Olympics show me is which country has more rich white kids. What's it cost to go skiing - $900 a day? I can't believe that's not more popular in the inner cities.

Daniel Tosh,"complaints,patients","A lot of times people complain that their significant other takes too long to get ready to go out at night. I've never had that complaint and I think it's because I never want to go anywhere, so I could care less how long it takes her to get ready. That's just less time I have to spend with her horrible friends pretending I don't want to kill myself. She'll take an hour and a half to get ready, come down and be like, 'Oh my goodness, you were so patient.' And I'll be like, 'For what? You look disgusting.' Now she's crying, whatever, I bought myself an extra two hours to watch the game. It's not like she's going to break up with me; she's 10 years younger, she's one opinion away from being replaced.

Daniel Tosh,,It's not Spring Break until somebody dies!

Daniel Tosh,,A gynecologist is the dentist for the downstairs mouth.
Daniel Tosh,"men,women,hockey,surfing,fishing","Women can do anything men can do… except math, chess, running, jumping, lifting stuff, fixing things, making money, hockey, surfing, driving, making decisions, being tall, taking out the garbage, tipping, fishing, being funny on purpose, reading a map, listening to good bands, writing, running the country, inventing anything important, or being fun to hang out with. Don’t get me wrong, I love women, I just think they should drink from a separate water fountain."
Daniel Tosh,,Kangoroos can't hop backwards.
Daniel Tosh,,"No one dies a virgin, Life screws us all."
Daniel Tosh,,There is nothing so annoying as having two people talking when you're busy interrupting.
Daniel Tosh,,"Real patriotism is realizing America sucks, but everywhere else is a thousand times worse."
Daniel Tosh,,"Don’t blame your failure on haters. If everyone thinks you suck, they’re not haters. They’re right."
Daniel Tosh,,"I never got a birds and the bees speech as a child. The closest thing I ever got - one time, my dad was cooking breakfast; he's like, 'Sex is a lot like this egg. First thing you gotta do is heat up the bed real nice, get it nice and warm, get it ready for her. Then, you gotta take her, crack her over the head and lay her out flat, alright? Come on now - wait 'til she starts sizzlin' really good, then you can flip her on over - there ya go. Don't get too excited or you get yellow stuff all over the bacon.'"
Daniel Tosh,soccer,"If you like soccer, then welcome to America. See, our country already has entertainment so watching people chase a ball for four hours to end 0 - 0 is not enjoyable - unless, of course, the bleachers collapse and half of Europe dies."
Daniel Tosh,,"If you support the second amendment, then let me exercise my support of our first amendment: you’re a fucking idiot. Do you even know what the third amendment is? The right to kick soldiers out of your house when the Revolutionary War is over."
Daniel Tosh,"girlfriends,asians","I hate you, Google. You've caused a lot of problems in my relationship. I share a computer with my girlfriend and she would look up anything. ""I'm going to look up apples today."" She just hits 'A.' It's ""Asian ass porn"" instantly. Google is, like, ""I'll take it from here. I know exactly what you're looking up... Well, every time you hit 'A,' it's 'Asian ass porn.'"" Google! All I ask is that you let her type three letters before you jump to such a bold conclusion. It's bad enough that I'm clearing my history every three hours and changing my passwords. I'm trying to have an honest relationship, and you are fucking my shit up!"
Daniel Tosh,,"How come everybody cheers when chicks flash their T&A, but when I pull out my D&Bs, i'm a registered sex offender."
Daniel Tosh,,"Do you love 'Trading Spaces'? I do. I would never be on that show, though. You want to know why? 'Cause you have to trust your friends to decorate your house. You have not met my friends. They do not have my best interests at heart. 'Cause it's always some over-the-top, eccentric interior designer coming in, going, 'Oh my goodness, I love this place. This is what I'm thinking for your friend's house: circus tent. Big circus tent! Do you think your friend would like a circus tent?' 'Oh yeah, he'd love a circus tent. No, no no no, yeah. Why don't you go dig up the hardwood floors, get down to the dirt, that way the ponies will feel at home.' 'Great. We're under budget.'"
Daniel Tosh,"religion,business","Does everybody have their WWJD bracelets on? 'Cause I was wearing my bracelet recently, and I was in the movie theater, and this guy's cell phone went off - don't you just hate that? Then he picked it up, 'Hey, how's it going? I'm in a movie.' And I'm like, 'Hey! Get off the phone!' And he's like, 'Mind your own business.' And I almost went crazy, but then I looked at my bracelet: what would Jesus do? So I lit him on fire and sent him to Hell."
Daniel Tosh,soul,It’s not that hard to climb a pole. All you need are powerful thighs and an empty soul.
Daniel Tosh,,"I do think we can be a little less PC when it comes to sports, though. Just once I want to hear an announcer go ‘God, black people are fast. Holy cow! All of them. They’re fast. Back to you Bob.’"
Daniel Tosh,,"Am I the only person who blames global warming entirely on the Amish? Are they not a constant reminder of how awful life would be without all this great technology? Every time I want to cut back and conserve on natural resources, I just look at the Amish and I'm like, 'Fuck that.'"
Daniel Tosh,sex,"Anal sex is a lot like spinach: if you're forced to have it as a child, you won't enjoy it as an adult."
Daniel Tosh,,It's not a stereotype if it's always true.
Daniel Tosh,future,"Every year on my birthday I get a small dash on my inner thigh where my balls currently hang. You can't tell me that's not going to be a beautiful work of art when it's finished. My grandkids are playing with my balls, they can't figure it out. They're like, 'What are these things?' I'm like, 'It's your future, read the chart.' They don't stop growing; they're like earlobes. That joke was inspired by a door that wasn't locked when I was 11."
Daniel Tosh,,"I think boxers are the greatest athletes in all sports for the simple fact that they don't cry. That is mind-blowing. Have you ever been punched in the nose? Oh my gosh, it hurts so bad. They have to go back to corner, where some little man yells at them. 'Shut up, I just got punched in the face!'... If I was a boxer, do you know who I would hire as my corner man? My mom."
Daniel Tosh,,"I don’t believe space exists. You’re not gonna put a camera on a roomba, stick it in the desert, and tell me it’s Mars."
Daniel Tosh,,"You know why they say that, that models are too skinny? Because parents are horrible, they can’t tell their sixteen year old daughter she’s not really a princess, well guess what, I can."
Daniel Tosh,"honesty,criticism","Honest criticism is hard to take, particularly from a relative, a friend, an acquaintance, or a stranger."
Daniel Tosh,,"I'd like a game show with millionaires on it, and they have to play with their own money, and they can't win money, they can only lose 'til one them goes complete broke, and the show's called 'Ha Ha, Now You're Poor.'"
Daniel Tosh,embarrassment,"Pepper spray is a woman’s go-to weapon of choice, it even comes in different strengths in case you’re only semi-serious about not getting raped. If you were truly nervous about your safety, you’d carry a gun, not a spice. Bullets travel a lot faster than mist. What predator’s gonna wait while you rummage through your purse to find a tube of Tabasco sauce? You can’t even find your phone in there when it’s ringing and vibrating. Nothing’s more embarrassing than being the girl who always has pepper spray but never has to use it. May as well leave your weapons at home cause the cat knitted on your sweater does the job just fine."
Daniel Tosh,,I feel bad sometimes because I secretly hope New Orleans gets nailed again.
Daniel Tosh,california,"People always say I couldn’t live in California cause they love seasons too much, yeah I do too that’s why I live in a place that skips the shitty ones."

Daniel Tosh,,"I don't think I could stab somebody, 'cause I'm really bad at a Capri Sun."
Daniel Tosh,,"Some say the glass is half empty, some say the glass is half full, I say, are you going to drink that?"
Daniel Tosh,"kids,challenges,violence","""There’s no excuse for domestic violence."" It sounds like a challenge. I mean, does everything have to be so black-and-white in this kindergarten country of ours? What if you come home from a long day at work and your wife has drowned two of your kids - she’s about to dunk the third one. Can you run over and pop her then? ""Unfortunately no, there’s no excuse. You’re going to have to let her drown that third one."""
Daniel Tosh,,Technically it's not premarital sex if you don’t plan on marrying them.
Daniel Tosh,,My favorite thing to steal is a kiss. You can get arrested for it but they can’t force you to give it back.
Daniel Tosh,,"Thank you people that are laughing with your hand away from your mouth. That joke is clearly not for everyone, but I enjoy watching people that don’t laugh make the people that do laugh feel shitty about themselves."
Daniel Tosh,"society,stupidity","Sure I may look adjusted, but I can’t function in normal society because most of you are too stupid."

Daniel Tosh,,Never hit a woman unless you are a bigger woman.
Daniel Tosh,,Scattergories is second base for Christians.
Daniel Tosh,"embarrassment,golf",I didn’t have a priviledged childhood like a lot of you. I grew up on a public golf course and that’s embarrassing. I lived on the right side of the fairway. All these hacks slicing into your yard. You don’t hear “Fore!” while you’re mowing. “Nothing runs like a Deere.” ‘Til a Titleist is lodged in your carburator.
Daniel Tosh,,It’s all fun and games until someone gets a boner.
Daniel Tosh,"television,new york","The worst television is MTV. 'Music Television' - they call it that, they don't even play music. How's that legal? What if everybody did that? 'Hey, thanks for calling New York Pizza.' 'Yeah, give me two large pepperoni pizzas.' 'Oh, we don't sell pizza.' 'What?' 'No, we just have raccoon hats and eye patches. Call a book store if you're hungry.'"
Daniel Tosh,cars,I don’t know what popping-and-locking is but I know to lock my car door whenever people are doing it.

Daniel Tosh,,"I hate the idea of owning a gun, but I love the idea of owning a cannon."
Daniel Tosh,,"Germany’s like Wisconsin, but with, like, a really bad past."
Daniel Tosh,mexicans,"Being a white boxer is like being a republican. No matter how hard you work, you’ll always lose because of the Mexicans."
Daniel Tosh,fishing,"You ever hear this expression? The worst day of fishing is better than the best day at work. Uh, I'll call B.S. I've watched the deadliest catch on Discovery. I've never once been at work, capsized in a 40 degree water, watched all my co-workers die, and be like, ""Hey, at least we're fishin'."""
Daniel Tosh,"airports,business","So when I get a phone call at the airport, I'll admit it, I like to have a little fun. 'Go ahead. Gate 47 is completely clear.' People notice in a hurry. 'Honey, something is going on. That guy has a wire hanging down, maybe we shouldn't be standing right here.' 'Stand down, blue team! Stand down, blue team!' 'Honey, there is a sting going down at the airport. I am not feeling safe. Please, let's move.' 'Stand down, down blue team! Don't - hold on, the subject's approaching. He's in a business suit with a briefcase. I repeat, the briefcase is in his hand.' And I find some random businessman. I run, and I just beat the crap out of him. And everybody starts clapping, 'Thank you for making our airways safe.' And then I go get on my plane, and that guy just has a weird story to tell for the rest of his life."
Daniel Tosh,,"We owe it to our troops to let them sleep in their own beds, wake up in the morning, have a delicious breakfast, and drive to war."
Daniel Tosh,decisions,Posting calorie counts on a menu is like a girl tattooing the number of STDs she has on her vagina. Everyone close enough to read those stats is already committed to that bad decision.
Daniel Tosh,hollywood,"Am I the only person who hopes that David Beckham has sex with Brad Pitt? I don't know who's in charge of casting in Hollywood, but make it happen before one of them is out of their prime. Can you imagine those two men together making love? If there's a man in here that's junk doesn't wiggle just a little bit at the thought of those two men together - this has nothing to do with your homophobic sexual preference. At that level it's art, you monkey. You should be honored that you share the same restroom with those Greek gods."
Daniel Tosh,"food,restaurants","Eating fast food is like murdering hitchhikers. As long as you only do it every once in a while, it will never catch up with you. If the word “nugget” is anywhere on your menu, I won’t eat at your restaurant. For me, mcdonald’s is just an emergency bathroom in over 119 countries. A hamburger shouldn’t cost 99 cents. Eating right is expensive, but what you spend on organic food, you save on new underwear."
Daniel Tosh,"embarrassment,golf",I didn’t have a priviledged childhood like a lot of you. I grew up on a public golf course and that’s embarrassing. I lived on the right side of the fairway.

Daniel Tosh,,"Have you heard about the morning after pill, or what I like to call breakfast in bed. Well have you heard about how some of the girls who have taken have died a few days later? Talk about two birds, looks like I will be going to the game this weekend boys."
Dat Phan,asians,"Us Asians look like we’re twenty until we’re fifty. Once we’re fifty, we look like Yoda."
Dat Phan,"school,asians",I knew comedy was for me when I was the only Asian in high school that failed math. But you know when I failed eight other students around me failed too.
Dat Phan,family,"And I come from a small Vietnamese family. We’re really close too, all ten of us."
Dat Phan,violence,"I watch Japanese animation, right? My mom's like, 'Dat Phan, you cannot watch cartoon - it's too violent!' This is the same woman that goes, like, 'Dat Phan, if you don't take out the trash now, I will kill you!'"
Dat Phan,,"I was doing gigs to stay alive. I worked two or three jobs at a time, there were times when I stayed up for 36 hours straight. I slept in shopping mall parking lots. A stand-up gig paid $35; then I could eat for another few days until the next gig. Literally, I was performing to live."
Dat Phan,"racism,dating","I don't think my mom’s racist, but I think she's old fashioned, you know? And she doesn't know how to, like, talk about it with me. She's like, 'Dat Phan, you like the soup? Eat the soup. Right there. You like the soup? Why you date the white girl?'"
Dat Phan,,"I'm gonna come home with, like, five fake earrings on and be like, 'Mom, today I joined five gangs.' 'Huh! You also five times gay! Get out of house, fruit loop.'"
Dat Phan,,"Telling a comedian ""Make me laugh"" on their time off, is like telling a professional dancer: ""Strip for me, you cheap little whore""."
Dat Phan,,"When you grow up poor, you have to either work really hard to try and get where you want to be, or you'll just stay put."
Dat Phan,dreams,"It's kind of funny how that happened. When I was a child, I had a dream of one day becoming very influential and being in the entertainment world. I really wanted badly for that to happen, and in the last couple of years, my manager told me I was nominated for the group of the Most Influential Vietnamese-American Individuals in the world, along with generals and ambassadors and surgeons. It's an honor. It's mind-boggling. I'm a college dropout; I'm a high school failure, someone who came from a homeless background, but I understand the American pop culture and doing comedy from my heart led me to be in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C."
Dat Phan,,"Vietnam, we take over by doing pedicure! That's how we take over. We take over one foot at a time, damn it - that's the plan of attack right there. We take over from the toe up, that's the plan. We spread over USA like fungus from the toe."
Dat Phan,happiness,"I learned that money's not happiness. The more famous I am and the more money I make, the closer I stay to my family and friends that I've known since junior high school. True happiness to me is the connection with fellow human beings I've known for a long time."
Dat Phan,,You can get to the next level if you're willing to give up everything and give everything you have in your heart to make it.
Dat Phan,,"I did whatever it takes to do stand-up. There is an abundance of material in struggling and poverty and trying to make it. There is so much humor in that, it's unlimited."
Dat Phan,,"I didn't do real well. I bombed. Something inside me told me to keep trying because I had nothing to lose. I gave it another shot, and I still bombed, but I got one laugh. And that laugh gave me encouragement to continue for the next seven years."
Dat Phan,asians,"I try not to represent just Asians. Instead, I try to expose our culture to everyone through humor & performance; Hoping that we will be a part of each other and more so a part of everything in a positive light"
Dat Phan,brain,"It's a constant battle between what your heart tells you, and what your brain tells you."
Dat Phan,,"We want to be seen as more than just martial artists, or bad stereotype token roles in American TV and movies."
Dat Phan,,"My dad only said two things to me around the house, you know, when I was there. Number one: 'Ok, Ok, USA.' And two: 'Good. Good, Dat Phan.' How do you carry a conversation on with that? Like, 'Dad, how are you doing?' 'Ok.' Like, 'Dad, the house is on fire.' 'Ok.'"
Dat Phan,hollywood,"I was living under a desk in West Hollywood. It was a closet that I shared with another comic. I was shocked when they called me to come in to try out for the show. The chances of me getting on a TV show and winning it is like one-in-a-million. I had only been doing comedy for six years at that point, so I was basically considered an open mic-er or maybe a feature act once in awhile."
Dat Phan,happiness,"Money comes and goes. I'm thankful I have money. I'm trying to save up more. I would like more money. But it's not happiness. If you're a millionaire and hate your family, hate your friends and your life, then what is the point? You're just a person with a lot of money and power who is not happy."
Dat Phan,,"My mom was so strict when I was a kid, she wouldn’t even let us watch The Brady Bunch. The Brady Bunch! She was like, ""That’s why you don’t watch The Brady Bunch, that show suck. Six kids, that’s nothing. That’s right, I have ten kids. Why don’t you watch me? No commercial here. No ads. I run the whole operation, Dat Phan, watch me."""
Dat Phan,"laws,hollywood","My poor mom, she's like, 'That's my son, Dat Phan. He crack joke all the time. I tell him go to law school, become a lawyer. But no, he move up to Hollywood - he live out of his car; he eat Top Ramen with all the gay guys.'"
Dave Attell,,Here's a tip: Never get drunk while wearing a hooded sweatshirt. You will eventually think there's someone right behind you.
Dave Attell,hitler,"Capital punishment, that thing scares me, it really does. I was talking to my friend about the electric chair, and he starts freakin' out. He's like 'the electric chair? That's too good for these people. That's too good for them'. Alright, how do we make the electric chair worse? How about this? They have to pedal a car battery to their own head. Is that ok? Is that enough, Mr. Hitler?"
Dave Attell,,Being on the road is kind of lonely.

Dave Attell,,"If that man's straight, then I am sober."
Dave Attell,,"For a long time the people at my shows were sort of the Pantera-tattoo trucker guys, really cool dudes, but I don't know what happened to them. That's the crowd that I like, the ones that don't get so offended just to be offended."
Dave Attell,,"A lot of these kids I think are more content just to be on Facebook and the computer than they are to actually go out. They just really want to get a picture to post to their buddies, and that's about it."
Dave Attell,,"You know what my drink is? Jack Daniel's. Yes, that is a wild man drink. That should come with bail money, you know what I'm saying? Because on Jack, you don't know where you're going to end up, but you know when you get there, you won't be wearing any pants."
Dave Attell,comedians,"I'm a stand-up comic. Anything else I do besides that is a plus, but stand-up comedy is what I do, it's what I've been doing and it's what I'm going to keep doing."
Dave Attell,,"Let's say you're in a situation where crystal meth can help you. Like, I don't know, you have too many teeth."

Dave Attell,,"I like writing a joke, and I like when a joke works, and I like other comics who tell jokes."
Dave Attell,dancing,"I hang out with my dad mostly, my dad was in the military. He's at that age now where his war stories and other stories have blended together, so now you don't know what he's talking about. ""One time, we were surrounded, then we ran out of ammo, then we were fighting hand-to-hand, then we started dancing, and that's how I met your mother."""
Dave Attell,smoking,"I smoke so much. Three packs a day... I went to the bathroom, a camel came out of my ass."
Dave Attell,,"And everything's over when your grandma walks in, get that dick outta the fish tank! Time for supper!"
Dave Attell,alcohol,"Things have been invented because of alcohol. Like the taser, okay? Yeah! The morning after pill, okay? The reach-around. Judge Judy. What has pot given the world? Hackey sack? Yeah! Hilarious ring tones? Oh gah! Ultimate Frisbee Championships? It sucks to be a champion at a sport that can't get you laid. I''s an unneeded skill like, I dunno, being the best banjo player. Or a squirter."
Dave Attell,driving,"I went to see the shuttle go up. There was nobody there; I was the only guy there. Everybody was at NASCAR. Who's your favorite astronaut? If you could only fuck one astronaut, who would it be? Mission specialist Blabadahdah? But NASCAR, now that's something different. 'Cuz goin' to outer space - that's for nerds. But driving quickly in a circle... hmm, who isn't wet?"

I’m talking to a girl: “hi, how ya doin’. Did you know Hitler was ticklish? Much like the sea otter. Where are you going? Come back!”"

Dave Attell,,"You should’ve hung out, man."
Dave Attell,,"Sparklers are the gay cousins of the fireworks family. I think a flashlight is more dangerous than a sparkler.

Dave Attell,tattoos,"Tattoos are cool because they don't belong on your body, but you put it there to say something about yourself. Much like my rolls of fat.

'You didn't know it David, but you're just in time for the Friday Morning Fart Song!' No, sorry, I'm not doing that. Even if it's only fifteen minutes, it's the worst fifteen minutes of your life.

David Steinberg,"success,philosophy",You get to a philosophy after a while that everything is sort of cycling in a way. You know I have a sort of capsulized philosophy that your success is so relative. When you’re a baby success is not wetting your bed. When you’re a teenager success is going all the way. When you’re a young man success is making money. When you are middle aged success is being happy. When you’re an old man success is going all the way. And when you’re really old it’s not wetting your bed.

Dom Irrera,,I was an actor in college and it was much easier than being a waiter. I thought it was fun to get paid. People were not exactly surprised to see me going in the field.
Dom Irrera,kids,"My father never cheated on my mother. He used to cheat on me. He used to pick other kids after school. Take them to the zoo. Take them to play ball. One day he came to me. He says, ""Look I got to level with you. I met another kid."""

Dom Irrera,restaurants,"That's one thing nobody ever bitching about in a restaurant - parsley. You never see some indignant customer: ""Waiter, please! Can we get a little more parsley over here?"""
Dom Irrera,alcohol,"I want to be a bloated alcoholic. That's my goal - it is, I'm serious, because there is no other disease that is more fun than alcoholism. I know it has its downside, but I'll tell you, there's no other party disease like alcohol."
Dom Irrera,,"Well, I am not always joking, sometimes I am serious. But some people always expect you to be funny. If you were like you are on stage, you would be obnoxious. With the jokes and the putdowns, I would need to take a break... juggle something."
Dom Irrera,,"Everyone always says, ""Does it bother you that Italians are always portrayed as Mafia characters?"" No, it doesn't bother me. First of all, not everybody in my family is in the Mafia. I have one uncle who's clean."

Dom Irrera,"doctors,friends",You ever get sick and one of your friends gives you medical advice? And they tell you that they're not a doctor - like you didn't know it?

Don Rickles,,"I don't have regrets. I've never sat here and thought, Gee, if only I'd done The Man Who Came to Dinner on Broadway, I would have been happier."
Don Rickles,,"Famous people are deceptive. Deep down, they're just regular people. Like Larry King. We've been friends for forty years. He's one of the few guys I know who's really famous. One minute he's talking to the president on his cell phone, and then the next minute he's saying to me, Do you think we ought to give the waiter another dollar?"

Don Rickles,age,"Once in a while, when I'm alone, I think about my age. I think, How many more years do I have on this earth? But I can't really conceive of dying. Somehow, in my head, I don't think I'll die. I know that everybody dies, of course. I just think that it'll never come to me. It's crazy, but there it is."
Don Rickles,,"People think being in your seventies means sitting around in a chair with a blanket over your legs, drooling."

Don Rickles,"care,friends,importance,family","I don't care if the average guy on the street really knows what I'm like, as long as he knows I'm not really a mean, vicious guy. My friends and family know what I'm really like. That's what's important."
Don Rickles,,Room service is great if you want to pay $500 for a club sandwich.

Don Rickles,,"I have my own gym. When you do jokes and they sell, you get a gym."
Don Rickles,,"I mean, in my - and I'm not trying to do spilled milk, but in those days it was a little - I think it was much tougher, because you got an image, and you were in a saloon. And it was tough to come out of a saloon and to get in films, and to maintain an image, you know."
Don Rickles,,"I always rib people, but nobody ever gives me a hard time. I don't know why. Maybe they're afraid of what I might say. There's probably a lesson in that somewhere, but I don't know what it is."

You’re always allowed to grow up. If you want."
Donald Glover,asians,Are their Asian girls here?! Minority report!
Donald Glover,"9/11,teachers","We had a teacher, named Mr. Brown, and he was writing something on the board once - he was writing something on the board, and he farted. And you would have thought kids had seen the face of God. Kids weren't even laughing; they were just sitting there screaming, just screaming. Kids had to get carted out; kids were screaming. Kids had to get carted out, and they were going to the nurses' office. Kids are crying in the hallway. 'Oh, this is our 9/11.' And it was. It was their 9/11 'cause they never thought anything like that could ever happen."
Donald Glover,iphone,"I write raps so sometimes I will write them in my iPhone. So I was writing the n-word in my iPhone and my iPhone goes, 'Did you mean niggardly?' And I was like, 'No iPhone. I meant nigger; write it.' But then, two weeks later, I was writing Jigga - which is the shortened form of Jay-Z. And my iPhone goes, 'Did you mean nigger?' And I went, 'Whoa, iPhone. You do not get to say that.'"
Donald Glover,,I'm probably going to get in trouble for this but 'American Dad' is one of my favourite shows. It gets very dark in places but the jokes are there.
Donald Glover,,"I started doing '30 Rock' and started writing 'Mystery Team' at the beginning of that. While I was doing 'Mystery Team,' I started practicing stand-up. While I was doing stand up, I got 'Community.' It's like I planted trees six years ago, and now they have fruit."
Donald Glover,,"I'm very impatient, so I was like, 'I want to be able to do whatever I want now.' But even the biggest stars - you look back and they weren't overnight."

Donald Glover,,"Also, I realized a lot of kids are listening to me. Whether I want to be or not, they're looking up to me."
Donald Glover,,"I feel like… I don’t have a wife, I don’t have a kids, but… I see rappers and I’m like, I know that’s fake. I know how much you make, this is all bullshit. But people are buying into it, and you shouldn’t have that power. I’m legit trying to make honest moves so that all of us can grow. I want to make a show where my sister can work on and become a producer because she can’t get in, no one’s leting her. I want to make things where people can actually grow. A place where people can actually be honest."
Donald Glover,,"Sometimes when jokes fall flat, you feel so alone. You’re like, “Well, I thought this was funny.” Sometimes you can feel really lonely."
Donald Glover,,"I don’t know if this is a nerdy quality or just something left over from my uncle’s alcoholism, but I get obsessed with things very easily, things that don’t matter.

Donald Glover,,"Most people think I'm Danny Glover's son when they meet me. So when they ask, I say 'No, I'm Crispin Glover's son.' Then we stare at each other for a long time."

Donald Glover,,"Dress like a gentleman, but my mouth is never civilized."
Donald Glover,,"I don't talk soft, that's that other dude."
Donald Glover,,"Urkel was retarded, let's be honest. No, he was. If there was a kid named Steve Urkel who went to your school - dressed like Steve Urkel, eating cheese all the time, always asking this girl named Laura to marry him - you'd be like, 'Oh yeah, Steve. His brother hit him in the head with a brick when he was five. Very sad situation at the Urkel house.'"

Donald Glover,,"It's the hand job of cereals 'cause it's like, 'This is pretty good, but you know what I really want.'"
Donald Glover,diapers,"There’s just something about when kids do something, it’s always going to be funny, because kids grow up. Nobody doesn’t grow up, and whatever you do as a kid usually isn’t considered amazing when you’re an adult. A baby changing its own diaper, you’d be like, “That baby is a fucking genius.” But when he’s 27, you’re like, “He shouldn’t be wearing diapers anymore.”"
Donald Glover,new york,"L.A. is such a different place. I miss New York so much. I almost teared up when I came back and wanted a Guinness and realized I could drink it and take a cab home. I remembered that I could be a functional alcoholic in New York, like I used to be!"
Donald Glover,,"If you like strange, specific stuff - that's a nerd. Kanye West is a black nerd. He likes strange, specific stuff. If you go up to Kanye West and say, 'Hey, what are your favorite things?' He'll be like, 'Robots and teddy bears.' That's a nerd."

Donald Glover,,"To all my fans who’s saying Donald Glover about to blow, just give me six months so you can say I told you so."
Donald Glover,,"Black culture is a fight. We want to hold on to what we are, but sometimes the things that we are can be totally negative. You have to think: can't we try something new and not be seen as suspect?"
Donald Glover,,"We weren’t allowed to have any sugary cereals as a kid. The two cereals we were allowed to have were Cheerios and Kix. And Cheerios is, like, cardboard doo-doo. And Kix is kinda like the handjob of cereals… cause it’s like, ""this is pretty good… but you know what I really want…"""

Donald Glover,,I wanna go to rehab and compare penises with famous people.
Donald Glover,,I think it's a comedian's job to make everything funny. Nothing is off-limits.
Donald Glover,,Took the G out your waffle all you have left is your ego.
Donald Glover,,"Writing is a very strenuous thing - it's like banging your head against a wall. At the end of the day, acting is better, just because nobody ever asked me if I wanted a Pellegrino in the writer's room."
Donald Glover,,"An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything."
Donald Glover,"white people,obama","It's kind of redundant - have a black dude wearing an Obama shirt. Everybody's like, 'Yeah, we know. You like Obama; we get it.' It's just like, I would do the same thing. I realize that it's kind of redundant. I don't go up to white people wearing Coldplay shirts. 'You like Coldplay? For how long? Forever?'"

Donald Glover,,Kept looking for something to be in with. Follow someone’s blueprint. But you have to be on your own.
Donald Glover,,"The only reason I'm able to do music is because I'm making money on 'Community.' If I wasn't, I couldn't pay for things."
Donald Glover,,"I don’t want to be niche… I want to be as big as I can be. This album is not a rap album, I want to make pop. I don’t mean pop like Katy Perry, and I love that, I’ll play that shit at my wedding, but… Peter Gabriel’s pop, Hall & Oates was pop… but I want it to be real."
Donald Glover,restaurants,"When you get called the n-word, as a black person you can do anything. It's like getting a gold star in Super Mario Brothers and junk. I hear the music when I hear the n-word. I get right into it; I get really into it. You can do anything. You could be in a fancy restaurant - just start throwing poop at the walls. People be like, 'What are you doing?' 'Someone called him the n-word.'"
Donald Glover,dreams,May your dreams be sweet and your nightmares be spooky-monster-scary and not grandma-died-scary.
Donald Glover,,"Usually, if I think something is really funny, I'm not gonna test it. I'll just test it when I'm onstage."
Donald Glover,,We put stereotypes on ourselves. Everybody does that. But I think it's just a little harder for black kids to just be who they are.
Donald Glover,,"I call 'Community' the best day job in the world, because between takes, I get to write music. I get to write sketches. I get to write movies. It's the best job ever."

Donald Glover,,"They say my public persona don’t have enough appeal, I take a lesson from Kanye and give 'em something real."
Donald Glover,football,"When you think of the former high school football star, you think 6-foot-2, white, meathead as the model for that kind of character. Since I'm not 6-foot-2 or white, I just thought about what I could bring to it. I thought about Smash Williams from 'Friday Night Lights,' like the cocky quarterback, and played around with that."
Donald Glover,obama,"When he was coming up, people were like, 'We have a serious black candidate for president. This is crazy. We have a serious black candidate.' And then when he won, they were like, 'Our first multi-racial president.' And I was like, 'That's not fair.' I mean, let's set the record straight.

Donald Glover,worth,"I was having sex with this girl. And we were towards the end. And she goes, “Fuck me hard with that n-word dick.” And I stop… look at her right in the eye… and I came harder that I ever cum before. It was so awesome, you guys… It was almost worth being black my entire life."
Donald Glover,,"Suicide is kinda dumb to me. If I wanna kill myself I will. It’s not hard to die, I could do it like right now. But why is everybody pretending like everything’s ok, Everything’s not ok. We are more connected than we’ve ever been, But I feel more alone than I’ve ever been."
Donald Glover,,"I had a 'Simpsons' and 'Everybody Hates Chris' spec and I remember thinking I was never going to hear from them again. Even after meeting with Tina, I left thinking I wasn't going to get it."

Donald Glover,worth,"My friends come and ask me ""Is it worth it?"" I say well shit it better be, I did this shit on purpose!"
Donald Glover,"men,women","Why don't women have crazy men stories? I don't really hear them. And then I realized, it's because if you got a crazy boyfriend, you're going to die. Just something about men, the second they realize they're crazy, it's like, 'Time to kill everything I love.'"
Donald Glover,,Made the beat then murdered it. Casey Anthony.
Donald Glover,,This one kid said something that was really bad. He said I wasn't really black cause I had a dad.
Donald Glover,,"I'd much rather have AIDS than a baby... They're not that different at all. They're both expensive, you have them for the rest of your life, they're constant reminders of the mistakes you've made and once you have them, you pretty much can only date other people who have them."

'Them dudes from Assgan, son!'"

Donnell Rawlings,,"The only thing we've found since we've been in Iraq is $700 million. Remember that story? The two sergeants found $700 million in a cave. And I knew they was white boys soon as I heard they gave all that money back... If that was me, I would've reported it, but it would've been a different amount. I'm like, 'Yo yo yo, Captain!

Donnell Rawlings,change,"The worst person is the person that resists change. You could be that angry older guy who can be mad about it or you can embrace it. Anytime you try something different, people are going to be like, ‘That’s not how it used to be.’ It was. Guess what? That’s how it is. You have to adapt to it. You can’t be mad."

We're not going to take a chance on a Gummi Bear.'"

I got to tell you, he was kind of smelly, but he was a good conversationalist."

Doug Benson,,"Everyone wants to look good in photographs, even us trolls who tell jokes."
Doug Benson,brain,"I can hear the wheels grinding in your confrontational brains, 'If he loves movies, then why does he seem to hate every one that comes out?' Because most movies stink like 1929's garbage - a particularly bad year for garbage - that's why! If everything didn't suck, then I wouldn't hate everything. It's that simple."
Doug Benson,laziness,"People say pot smokers are lazy. I disagree. I am a multitasking pot smoker. Just the other day I was walking down the street. Stoned. OK, I won’t count that as two things.

Doug Benson,,"I just jot jokes down as I think of them, and then add them to the act the next time I’m on stage. Jokes are never really “done,” because each time you perform them you can add words or nuances that weren’t there before."
Doug Benson,importance,"I think there is much more storytelling in stand-up now. Less emphasis on the joke. Jokes are still important, but it feels like a more intimate and personal experience these days."
Doug Benson,experience,"Stand-up is a very scary, very solitary profession, but you have to experience it to figure out if it’s right for you."
Doug Benson,,"You can’t always be 100-percent positive that a joke will work, so you’ve just got to try it. Fortunately, if one new joke doesn’t work, I’ve got lots of old ones that do. Just like cops, it’s important to have backup."

Doug Benson,,"Fans of the comic book are upset that the filmmakers chose to depict Spider-Man's web shooter as organic instead of as a device created by his alter ego, Peter Parker. Fucking nerds!"

Doug Stanhope,,"I really like Dane Cook as a person. And I want to fuck him, mentally and physically. I'll stop there before offering anymore bad puns."
Doug Stanhope,,I don't ever want to become Bill Maher where I have to find some strong opinion on something just because it's in the news. That's the guy that comes off like you have to be angry every week about new topics and snotty about something. That's what I'm trying to avoid.
Doug Stanhope,,Get the right to marry - and then don’t.
Doug Stanhope,society,"It’s not fucking ADD I’m thinking. I’m thinking about things that are more interesting than you. I’m trying to build the perfect utopian society in my head and you’re talking to me about what? Fucking bowling, I don’t give a shit. "
Doug Stanhope,,"I’m just funnier when I’m drunk. Not falling-down drunk, just drunk enough to lose the self-doubt."
Doug Stanhope,accidents,"I've never tried to drive my career in any particular direction. I've always been an in-the-moment, live-for-today guy. I've never had a goal, and nearly everything I've done has been an accident. I just play to me, and if I can amuse myself, I consider it a victory."
Doug Stanhope,motivation,"It's simple: you legalise drugs. If all of a sudden fucking Walmart has mushrooms, pot, in a whole aisle, then there's no financial motivation for drugs gangs to be beheading people. Then proper crime and robbery, which should be illegal, we focus on that."
Doug Stanhope,,"You are a shit head, but I can make you feel like you’re not the only shit head."

Doug Stanhope,,"The next time you see a ‘hybrid’ car with a baby seat in it, smash the fucking windows out of that car, fight club style, steal the baby seat, leave a condom where the baby seat was and see if you send a message.

Doug Stanhope,,"You know, the funny thing about child pornography, aside from the lack of credits at the end..."

Doug Stanhope,democracy,"Democracy is the worst kind, I’m sorry but it is. “We get to pick our leaders.” Well, what if I don’t want a leader? Where does that vote go? I do good on my own, I don’t want to be led. Is that freedom?"
Doug Stanhope,"problems,judgment","The problem with this country is that old fucks vote. We got shit to do, old folks don't, the only thing they have to do is judge you and vote."

Doug Stanhope,,"I'm strongly debating quitting. I don't want to create things to be angry about, I'd sooner start doing happy shit."
Doug Stanhope,,You know what. I didn’t ask to be here... Sue my mother. She is the one who had the fucking goal to create life without it’s consent.

Doug Stanhope,business,"The more business gets involved, the less fun it is."
Doug Stanhope,,"With all the horrible, horrible shit that your priest is pumping into your kid's head, his dick should be the least of your worries, honestly. That's just a little mouthwash and a few years of therapy'll get rid of that. That Jesus shit will torture you for a lifetime."

Doug Stanhope,,I'd get demolitions experts to rig mother to implode like a skyscraper.
Doug Stanhope,,"I’ll defend child pornography, how about that? What’s wrong with seeing some child pornography? What if you watch child pornography because you find it hilarious? Then should it not a protected freedom of speech?"
Doug Stanhope,"government,politics,terrorists,motivation","I would have let a lot of people out of prison. I would start scaling back, I'd fire lots whole branches of government. I would bring troops back from every corner of the world. Politics is fucked beyond parties. With flat-form issues, people should be figuring shit out for themselves. I think I'd make a better terrorist than a president. I'm putting all my motivation into the wrong avenue."
Doug Stanhope,aggression,"After every school shooting, parents come on television and say: 'Rap music is the problem. And drugs. And the lack of metal detectors.' No. The problem is that a lot of your kids are aggressive dicks and you won't do shit about it. That's the problem."

Doug Stanhope,society,Coward is the most misused word in our society.
Doug Stanhope,challenges,"The fact is that really no comedian sets out to offend you. Some comics enjoy the challenge of taking a subject that is likely to be found offensive and trying to make it funny‚ but the object is still to make you laugh. Offense is only a calculated risk. It's highly unlikely that a comedian whose only goal was to repulse you would ever make it past an open-mic stage, far less build a long career of touring theatres and television appearances."
Doug Stanhope,audience,How does the audience fall under the illusion that they have some right to not be offended? Certainly you have the right to not be harmed; but offended? Imagine the number of subjects that might offend any single individual and multiply that by the number of people in any given audience. Subtract all those topics from any given comic's set list and what do you get? Mime. That's what you get and possibly what you deserve. I've been booed for wearing the jersey of an offending sports team and then won the audience back with rape jokes. Who can tell?
Doug Stanhope,,If you ever apologize to a heckler again I will rape you.
Doug Stanhope,cancer,"When you give to American Throat Cancer or whatever, it's almost like you're trying to buy karma. But you don't feel good about it because you know most of that is going to mailers and buying pink ribbons. When you fucking actually change a life like that, I've never felt better. That's something that, hopefully, I'll be talking about when I'm up there."
Doug Stanhope,,"Life is like a movie, if you've sat through more than half of it and it’s sucked every second so far, it probably isn't going to get great right at the end and make it all worthwhile. None should blame you for walking out early."
Doug Stanhope,,"I love conspiracy theories. I used to just live on it. You know it's all hype and garbage, but you're still really paranoid afterwards. It's fun entertainment."
Doug Stanhope,"drugs,terrorists","""Drugs support terrorism""? No, your SUV supports terrorism."
Doug Stanhope,society,The whole institution of marriage itself really has no place in a progressive society.
Doug Stanhope,"television,wrestling","Don't learn from other people's mistakes. That's the worst advice you could ever get. Other people are fucking morons. Wrestling's the number one show on cable television. You're gonna learn from their mistakes? They're fucking tools! You might be the first guy who could to do it right and be a hero for all of us. Take a chance and learn to fly there, Orville Wright!"

Doug Stanhope,"smoking,addiction",If second hand smoke is killing that many people and nicotine is so addictive then why is no one addicted to second hand smoke?
Doug Stanhope,friends,"I hate when your friends quit drinking on you, don't you? It's sad. I've lost more friends to AA than Liberace did to the virus. It's sad to see 'em go. You see a thirty day chip on your buddy's key ring, it's like seeing a toe tag on his cold, stiff corpse."
Doug Stanhope,,"I was 23 with a mullet doing lots of jerk-off material.""I can't look at the old tapes now."
Doug Stanhope,abortion,You have options when it comes to abortion now. It's not like 1955 when you just had to kick her down a staircase and hope for the best.
Doug Stanhope,"alcohol,care",Alcohol does not make ugly people attractive. It makes it so you could care less that they're ugly.
Doug Stanhope,,"Charlie Chaplin said something to the effect that humor is an act of defiance, that we must laugh in the face of our helplessness in the forces of nature or go insane. And where is he now? Dead."
Doug Stanhope,acceptance,There’s only so many pictures of yourself you can look at and hate before you have to just accept that you are a goofy looking fuck.
Doug Stanhope,,Your sins are what make you fantastic. It’s what makes you alive. You should wear your sins on your sleeve. You should be trying to top your sins on a daily basis.
Doug Stanhope,"danger,terrorists","It's thirty days since the terrorist act. George Bush has told us to go back to our normal lives and to go back to what we used to do, so I've gone back to thinking that George Bush is a soft-headed tit and a danger to all of us."
Doug Stanhope,"acceptance,motivation",I don't have a gun. But I think they level the playing field. I accept that there's really nothing you can do about it. It's like nuclear weapons; if they exist then eventually other people are going to have them. Maybe just take away people's motivation to use them.
Doug Stanhope,,Why even moon a sorority girl if they can't see the swingy egg bag part of it?
Doug Stanhope,teachers,"They don’t encourage you to be who you wanna be, they encourage you to be what they want you to be, no teacher is gonna tell you you’d be cut out to be a great pornstar or illegal arms merchant."
Doug Stanhope,"laws,change","Fuck that. If it's stupid, change it... If it's a dumb law, don't have it."
Doug Stanhope,audience,My audience scares the shit out of me.
Doug Stanhope,alaska,"Taking a leak on a tree in the great wilderness of Alaska should not be a ""who farted?"" situation."
Doug Stanhope,,America takes credit for giving you freedom that you had anyway. It's like going to a wedding and putting your tag on somebody elses box.
Doug Stanhope,,Sometimes American news is like a tired old whore that only tells you things you wanna hear.
Doug Stanhope,cancer,I don't like life that much. It's not that big a deal for me... I don't want to know I have cancer till it's visible to the naked eye.
Doug Stanhope,,"Excess in moderation: don’t drink a few beers every day after work, wait ‘till the end of the month and drink all the beers at once."
Doug Stanhope,,"Everybody's angry. They've got nothing to be angry at, so they're angry about nothing."
Doug Stanhope,people,"I am a very mediocre intellect, at best, and I am smarter than most people I know - and that terrifies me."
Doug Stanhope,,We live in a world where people will have a GPS and a crucifix on the same dashboard - and you want me to have hope for these fucking monkeys on swing-sets?

Doug Stanhope,,"Nothing makes you feel better inside, male or female, than when someone who shouldn't have fucked you, did."
Doug Stanhope,,If you've ever seen a vagina close up... it looks like an alien's gonna hop out and attach itself to your face and lay eggs in your mouth.
Doug Stanhope,,"Right at the end of the big wall of vibrators, $29.95, big rubber fist. Thirty bucks! Just in time for mothers day."
Doug Stanhope,drugs,"I drank, smoked and did drugs to get where I'm at."
Doug Stanhope,,Steal my stuff off the internet wherever you can and don’t apologize. Buy the CDs and DVDs from my site and feel free to burn ‘em and share ‘em. Then come to the show.
Doug Stanhope,motivation,"Why do you believe it and what's your motivation for believing in it? I don't even believe in the shit I say for a full 24 hours. I would love to have a consistent viewpoint of my own. It would be nice to have that solid, stiff head that said, 'Well, I'm a Democrat and that's because I believe, and my parents believe, that we should have some kind of social safety net.' They don't ever look at the flaws: you get her pregnant, you marry her. That's just what you do. I'd love to have that shallow, unquestioned belief."
Doug Stanhope,hate,Nationalism does nothing but teach you how to hate people you've never met.
Doug Stanhope,music,"Comedy is like music; it builds on itself. Once someone comes up with a theory or a different way of doing things, people start to mimic it on some level. That’s why you go back to the guys you loved in the 80s… and it just seems tired now, because it was all foundation."
Doug Stanhope,,"I drink during every show. I can’t remember the last show I did completely sober. It works for me. I use it as a tool. It’s like steroids are for athletes. I’m looser and more self-confident. If I drank less, I wouldn’t have been on stage this long."
Doug Stanhope,,"I’m always looking for something new to say. That’s the problem with doing it for this long, thinking of what haven’t I beaten to death that I care about? You try to break yourself out of your comfort zone, because comfort is deadly for a comedian. There’s a reason why jokes start with “Don’t you hate it when…?” and not “Do you know what’s really great?”"
Doug Stanhope,,The first thing I think of when I wake up is how close I am to death. But then it gets better during the day.
Doug Stanhope,"gays,society","I couldn't possibly explain why the common person would be against something like that. It's all rooted in sexual hang-ups. The whole institution of marriage itself really has no place in a progressive society. I don't know why anyone would want to get married heterosexually, so why they'd be against homosexual marriage is flummoxing. I only use that word when I'm talking to someone from the British press."
Doug Stanhope,,"I believe that everyone should be treated as an individual. Women should be treated equally in the right to vote, sure. But if I'm paying to see a comedy then I just want to see who's funniest, with everyone treated equally. I'm not going to say, 'Oh, I should see a woman this time because I saw a man last time.' It's hard to have blanket opinions."
Doug Stanhope,,Mutations are exciting. They try to fix 'em when they come out. Did you see the two-headed baby they killed last month when they tried to cut it apart? That was hilarious!
Doug Stanhope,,"If you need a baby that bad, go down to the pound and get one. Not even a baby - go get an old man. There's unwanted people of all ages, pre-made and waiting for you."
Doug Stanhope,,"""Oh look, she smiled at me!"" It's because you shit your pants."
Doug Stanhope,,"That place is so behind the times, you can't even get AIDS there yet."
Doug Stanhope,,"Before you ask for the people to rise up and take what’s theirs, meet the people, because they’re really, really, bafoons."
Doug Stanhope,,Anything that I don’t understand or can’t do is stupid.
Doug Stanhope,,"Unfortunately this is where comedy works, where people are the most miserable."
Doug Stanhope,,"If you get made fun of working at Pier One Imports, you can’t pelt them with poop."
Doug Stanhope,,People talk to you and they try to convince you that they like what they do just because it sucks less than what they used to do… which sucked a lot.
Doug Stanhope,,"So you stick something up your ass, and you hope it might work, and it usually helps."
Doug Stanhope,,Life gave you lemons and you turned it into golden showers. God bless you for that.

Doug Stanhope,"drugs,problems,addiction","They never differentiate between drug users and drug addicts... I've done most drugs there are socially, I never had a problem."
Doug Stanhope,stupidity,All traditions are stupid unless you came up with it yourself.
Doug Stanhope,,"I've had six or eight hookers in my life. I never woke up the next day thinking ""man I'm glad I got a hooker last night."""
Doug Stanhope,,British audiences are more polite and have a wider world view. You don’t have to put a fuck joke in every 90 seconds like you do with Americans.
Doug Stanhope,laws,"Whether the reasoning for these laws is insurance costs, more opportunities for random taxation through traffic stops, curbing lost production or any other justification that could be offered, the bottom line is that it isn't governments place. You own your body. No legislation should infringe on that."
Doug Stanhope,,The Unbookables are supposed to be unbookable. That's what it's all about.
Doug Stanhope,,The Mind is everything. Do drugs. But just don't have drugs.
Doug Stanhope,airports,It was either me or Confucius that said the journey of a thousand miles begins with a vicious ass raping at airport security.
Doug Stanhope,,"I had a girl say this to me. She goes ""you know, if god intended women to suck dick, he'd have made cum taste like chocolate"" I said ""Yeah, but he had to make it taste like bleach so you remember to do the laundry."""
Doug Stanhope,,"The good old days; it was good because they were young but they act like it was the day. No, youth is good. That's gone. You're fucked."
Doug Stanhope,,"Not only are the voices in your head real, but they’re accurate as well."
Doug Stanhope,danger,Pot is to narcotics what herpes is to social diseases; it doesn't count cos it's not really dangerous and it's too easy to get.
Doug Stanhope,"judgment,dancing","Remember the lesson that Susan Boyle taught us all. Before you judge an ugly person, give them two minutes to whistle a tune or tap dance for you. And if they can’t, fuck ‘em. Stupid ugly fuck."
Doug Stanhope,,Have you ever thought about registering as a sex offender just so your friends won’t bring their kids over to your house?
Doug Stanhope,,"Don't fucking work hard you die at the end, didn't anyone ever tell you that?"
Doug Stanhope,,"I used to do boiler room telemarketing for a living, like hardcore fraud stuff that gets busted on 60 Minutes every week."
Doug Stanhope,addiction,"There's no such thing as addiction, there's only things that you enjoy doing more than life."
Doug Stanhope,,Give me tired old whore porn... I can imagine she would at least fuck you well.
Doug Stanhope,,I'm not saying drinking is all that great but you know it's got benefits; you can't smoke somebody pretty.
Doug Stanhope,,"Are there any vice cops in here? You dicks. How do you do that for a living? I don't understand. I first read these stories and I think ""Don't you have real crime to fight somewhere?"" But then you think about it vice cops don't fight real crime; that's not their job. Real cops fight real crime. A vice cop's only job is to fuck up the party."
Doug Stanhope,,"I had no musical or athletic ability, and I wasn't particularly good looking. Comedy was something I could do for attention."
Doug Stanhope,,The Internet has done nothing but good for comedy all around. Comedians no longer have to rely on TV execs and club owners deciding if they are funny or not.
Doug Stanhope,,"There's a fraudulent root element of comedy in that we say things night after night as though they are rolling effortlessly from the brain and off the tongue, when in fact they are crafted over weeks and months and years."
Doug Stanhope,,Everything that is going to kill you is extremely appetizing.
Doug Stanhope,,It's our flaws who make us who we are.
Doug Stanhope,,"I've had some bad shows where I just sucked, but I've had some assholes, too. Some guy stood up Saturday night and said 'This is the same shit you've been peddling the last five times you've been here.' That's your biggest fear: someone who knows every word you've ever said."
Doug Stanhope,,It seemed like a funny thing to do! I thought we could maybe get on the ticket of the Libertarian Party. But people were either amused or horrified at the idea of me representing their party.
Doug Stanhope,,"I need you to love me, I don’t like me, either, if that helps."
Doug Stanhope,,"In 20 years of comedy, I’ve probably had a dozen good points."
Doug Stanhope,,"You got kids, and you want to pre-board an airplane? No. Fuck you. You wait till last. You're the problem. Let the homo pre-board."
Doug Stanhope,,"I don't know. Both my parents are dead. So? Wait, I got pictures of their corpses in my wallet. I had them blown up as murals. Here."
Doug Stanhope,,"Why would you die for someone's sins? Your sins are the only thing interesting about you, you dreary, bleak motherfuckers."
Doug Stanhope,,'Raising awareness' is another form of doing nothing!
Doug Stanhope,,Who better to do drugs than high school kids; what are you going to fuck up that bad when you're seventeen years old?
Doug Stanhope,,When you come out of that pink ugly hole onto this planet you're nothing but a gooey shrieking wrinkled ball of weakness.
Doug Stanhope,religion,"""A national day of prayer""? Does that scare the spine out of anyone? Especially when you consider that it's all those dog-shit religions that start these fucking wars to begin with. Ninety percent of every war that's ever been fought is because of some made-up, mind control, completely fictional religion."
Doug Stanhope,,"You forget, when you’re in the Scandinavian countries, you forget they don’t speak English first and they speak better than I do."
Doug Stanhope,,"The ones that bother me the most are the media saying, ""He's like the next Bill Hicks."" It's supposed to be complimentary, but then all these Bill Hicks fans show up thinking you're going to be like him, and then go, ""You're no Bill Hicks."" And I'm like, ""I never wanted to try to be like him, I don't think I'm anything like him at all, and now you're mad at me for not being him because a journalist didn't have a better reference."""
Doug Stanhope,religion,They shouldn't be able to teach religion until you're 18 years old and you know what? It'd be a whole different world because if they weren't pushing that shit into your head while it was still soft you'd never buy it.
Doug Stanhope,,"They say 'life is precious'. To who? To you, when you're young and you've got a few dollars in your pocket. Tell that to the 90-year-old lying awake at the graveyard shift in the nursing home, groaning with dementia. The only reason he hasn't killed himself is that he hasn't figured out a way he can do it with pudding."
Doug Stanhope,,"I blow a load in a girl’s hair out of respect for the environment and mother nature, and not only do I have to pay for your kids, I gotta fucking drive past the school at 15 miles an hour on my way home to jerk off and watch the Simpsons."
Doug Stanhope,swimming,"A lot of the Olympic games just boil down to genetics. Michael Phelps is genetically built to swim better than other people if he trains the same way. You might as well have a competition for who’s the tallest, and act like it’s anyone’s game!"
Doug Stanhope,,I have a picture I keep in my wallet of my father's corpse... I keep that picture in my wallet to show people who show me baby pictures.
Doug Stanhope,,"Nobody wants to hear ""don't fuck in the front hole"" after a hard day at work."
Doug Stanhope,,Rooting for the Yankees is like going to a casino and rooting for the house.
Doug Stanhope,cars,"I blew a speaker in my car today. Yeah, he was a motivational speaker. It left a bad taste in my mouth but I feel a lot more positive."
Doug Stanhope,"government,democracy","Democracy is the worst kind of government, I’m sorry. Would you still call yourself a Christian if they elected a new Jesus every four years?"
Doug Stanhope,,"My great great grandmother was a cunt in the late eighteen hundreds, long before it was popular to be a cunt."
Doug Stanhope,"kids,problems,violence","""It's the violence in the media that's the problem..."" No, the problem is a lot of your kids are dicks and you won't do shit about it."
Doug Stanhope,fishing,"They say if you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. But if you teach a man to fish... then he has to get a fishing license. But he doesn't have any money, so he has to get a job and enter the social security system. And he has to file taxes, and you're gonna audit the poor son of a bitch because he's not really good at math. You pull the IRS van up to his house and take everything. You take his velvet Elvis and his toothbrush and it all goes up for auction with the burden of proof on him because he forgot to carry the 1. All because he wanted to eat a fish, and he couldn't even cook the fish because you need a permit for an open flame."
Doug Stanhope,,"Man, it just cost me five dollars to beat my own meat... God bless the United States of America."
Doug Stanhope,arguments,"If you're gonna have a pro-drug argument, start the argument where it starts: I have the right to do what ever the hell I want to my own body, if it kills me slowly, happy for me, fuck you."
Doug Stanhope,"abortion,desire","Abortion is green! I think its irrefutable, but people don’t want to hear that. For most people, having children is an instinctual, natural desire and the last thing they want to do is believe that it has any detrimental side, or if they do believe it, they think it’s different for them because they live in a gated community or whatever the reason…"
Doug Stanhope,laws,"You’re born absolutely free except for laws of nature, if you drink you get drunk, that’s a law, if you get old you die, that’s a law too; if you sit on a tack you will bleed from the ass, these are the only laws that you’re born with."
Doug Stanhope,,Find something living rent free in your uterus? Evict that motherfucker!
Doug Stanhope,"drugs,advertising",If you have a good product. You don't need to advertise. You've done drugs? Did you ever see them advertised?
Doug Stanhope,government,"How do you pledge allegiance to a government? That’s all America is: a government. There’s no such thing as ‘we’re Americans.’ That’s just trivial bullshit to get you rooting for the home team. You’re not an American. You’re a guy, you’re a person, you’re an individual."
Doug Stanhope,,I've done coke 'til my nose was bleeding like the fourth week of Lilith Fair.
Doug Stanhope,drugs,There's only two types of people who are against drugs: the people who have never done drugs and the people who really sucked at doing drugs.
Doug Stanhope,,"Tradition and heritage are all dead people's baggage, stop carrying it. Move forward."
Doug Stanhope,gays,"If you are in here and you are gay and you are offended that I'm using the word faggot, I apologize and I'll suck your dick after the show."
Doug Stanhope,,Life's temporary for a reason; it gets boring after a while.
Doug Stanhope,smoking,Watching someone smoke when you can't is like watching porno without being able to jack off.
Doug Stanhope,dancing,"If people would just fuck right away and stop all the song and dance that goes with it, we could have colonies on Mars by now."
Doug Stanhope,,"Sex is a very narrow avenue. You only have so many holes and parts, and eventually, you run out of things to do."
Doug Stanhope,"women,prostitutes","If God had intended women to prostitute themselves, he would have given them a free will and a vagina."
Doug Stanhope,parents,If you get offended by words - by noises we make with our mouths - it means you were raised by bad parents.
Doug Stanhope,cancer,"All illegal narcotics are medicinal. Boredom is a disease worse than cancer. Drugs cure it, with little or no side effects if used as directed. Life's temporary for a reason, it gets boring after awhile."
Doug Stanhope,,"You say you hate children and people always say the same thing; ""it would be different if it was your own child."" Well what if it wasn't?"
Doug Stanhope,,How many kids do you have? Two. Don't have any more. That's the highest acceptable point... from now on take it in the ass.
Doug Stanhope,,You kinda wish a girl would bleed a little bit from the head during that time so you know before you approach her at the bar.
Doug Stanhope,,You've done something alright with your life when the only rule on your job is don't shake your cock at the customer.
Doug Stanhope,,The media tells me what I find attractive in a woman? I think my dick tells me what I find attractive in a woman.
Doug Stanhope,,The kind of beautiful that if your life ever flashed before your eyes you'd have to stop at that part and beat off.
Doug Stanhope,,I understand dildos: not everybody has fifteen inches of dick to swing around to scare the children.
Doug Stanhope,,Raccoons don't need to do poppers in order to come while they're having anonymous same-sex interludes in a highway rest area.
Doug Stanhope,,"I am 42 years old and I have $9000, and I am out of ideas. I've nothing to spend it on. I'm bored shitless. I will die with that $9000."
Doug Stanhope,,The first five times that you bang someone and the last million times are two different worlds.
Doug Stanhope,,If I was a freak of nature... Hell yeah I wanna do freak shows! I don't wanna be applying for jobs at the mall.
Doug Stanhope,,Don't get upset. I'm probably wrong about half the shit I say.
Doug Stanhope,,"Invent new drugs, that's what you should be doing... fight to get new weirder ones... and weirder establishments to do them in."
Doug Stanhope,hate,Don't do shit you hate... there's another way... quit. Go in Monday and steel a bunch of shit and quit... and steel big shit too.
Doug Stanhope,,"You were born free, you got fucked out of half of it and you wave a flag celebrating it."
Doug Stanhope,,How about a national day of get drunk and say fuck it.
Doug Stanhope,,"Before modern medicine, would pussies just generally rot up inside you and fall out of you like spoiled oysters on the sidewalk?"
Doug Stanhope,religion,Religious tolerance. No! Zero tolerance for any type of religion.
Doug Stanhope,,"People who want to kill other people are the last people I want to party with, because I get mouthy when I drink."
Doug Stanhope,,"I've been doing a lot of drugs in the last few weeks and drinking less, and I feel much better."
Doug Stanhope,,Don't eat a mushroom stem and see colors; eat the whole bag and see God one time in your life.
Doug Stanhope,,"Do you ever wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and think, something’s not accurate?"
Doug Stanhope,,"If you ever find the perfect person, run so fast that they see flames shoot out of your ass 'cause all the perfect person does is amplify your flaws a thousand-fold. It makes you feel like that much more of a dick: I used to be a partier; now, I'm an alcoholic. It's all in who's judging."
Doug Stanhope,"government,abortion","I wish the 50 states would break up. Lose the centralised government. More choice. How do you want to live, there’s 50 different ways! You hate black people? We’ve a state for that. You wanna have an abortion? Here’s a state. I think we should just keep breaking up countries now so they become just individuals."
Doug Stanhope,alcohol,"If I have to be a monotheist, y’know pick one, I’m picking vodka, it goes well with everything, all occasions."
Doug Stanhope,,"Fuck you, Guardian, for calling me a liberal."
Doug Stanhope,,Wanting more. Having your cake or eating your cake are fine. Not even wanting cake is where you get fucked.
Doug Stanhope,alcohol,"They should raise the alcohol age to 60, so at least you'd have something to look forward to at this point."
Doug Stanhope,"religion,atheism,agnosticism","You never hear in the news, ""200 killed today when Atheist rebels took heavy shelling from the Agnostic stronghold in the North."""
Doug Stanhope,,You do bits and you fake anger and you write a bit and you have passion for it. Then you do it too many times and you have to work up the anger... and I’ve never had to do that with Dr. Drew Pintsky. Dr. Drew is to medicine what David Blaine is to science.
Doug Stanhope,,Alcoholics Anonymous makes scientology look credible!
Doug Stanhope,shoes,"I hate Sarah Palin in the same way I hate a book by its cover. It's her pandering, Fifties sitcom character persona. It is nothing to do with what she's saying because anything those people are saying is trying to dupe the masses on some level. The fact that a personality like that could be taken as anything other than cartoonish is worrying. Like Bozo the Clown, ""It's time we should all vote, kids!"" and then people saying, 'You know what, that guys really got something.' It's a fucking clown with floppy shoes and you're taking him seriously?"
Doug Stanhope,,Children are like poems. They're beautiful - to their creators - but to others they're just silly and fucking annoying.
Doug Stanhope,,If you really believe death leads to eternal bliss then why are you wearing a seatbelt?
Doug Stanhope,"politics,tea","I don't think the Tea Party and Glenn Beck are responsible for one man's mental illness. Jared Lee Loughner, Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords' alleged assassin, was a psychopath. They didn't even know if the congresswoman was dead or not when they started saying that this was the result of volatile political rhetoric. What the fuck are they talking about? Every logical faction has come out and said that this psycho didn't watch the news, he wasn't a political junkie, he was far beyond that. We have to tone down political rhetoric."
Doug Stanhope,,"I love when you get boner spam for boner pills and the subject is ""Be a better lover"". Oh, the boner was the problem on that? That’s why I’m a bad lover? Do you have a pill that’s gonna make me care if she cums? That would be a medical miracle."
Doug Stanhope,,"Your children can’t do shit, they can’t drink, they cant smoke, they can’t drive, they can’t vote, they can’t work, they can’t fuck for god’s sake! And you wonder why your teenager’s such an asshole... it’s cuz he’s bored out of his tit! You won’t let him do anything else!"
Doug Stanhope,,People hate people just cause they want someone different to hate.
Doug Stanhope,,"I used to have solutions in my act. I'd find a social ill of some kind and I’d rail about it, and then have a solution to that problem. And I’d throw a fist fuck joke in the middle to make it all fit under the umbrella of comedy. And now I just have fuck it let’s just kill a bunch of people."
Doug Stanhope,,How dare anyone in the UK make fun of a democratically-elected leader when you have a fucking Queen?

Doug Stanhope,,Even your religious friends do not want to hear about God during a medical diagnosis.
Doug Stanhope,art,"I really don't like art with a message. If you have a message that really needs to be said, just fucking say it."
Doug Stanhope,,"I had jobs that were as short as an hour and a half. One was putting circulars into newspapers, and I worked at it for 90 minutes before I said “I’m going to the bathroom” and never came back. I never spent a lot of time at a boring job. I’d either quit, or I’d try to make it fun and they would try to fire me. When I worked for a collections agency, I’d fuck with people until it became like a Jerky Boys routine. My bosses would tell me, “You’re still supposed to get the money from them.”"
Doug Stanhope,life,"I am a player in life, not an observer. I look at herpes the way you look at a scraped knee."
Doug Stanhope,,"Humor is something men have to develop when they don’t have other skills to attract women. It’s a form of plumage that we’ve developed naturally as animals. Women don’t have to do that. You never hear a guy say, “Yeah, the first thing I want in a woman is that she’s gotta be funny.” Women aren’t funny as a rule. It’s just far more rare."
Doug Stanhope,wrestling,"The ultimate act of cowardice is the fat-headed wrestling guy sitting behind the frail kid in math class, clipping him on the ear, saying: 'What are you going to do about that, faggot?' That is cowardice. When the bullets start flying past that jock's saucer-shaped ears, that's not cowardice. That's payback."
Doug Stanhope,,"My mother was always the one with the dark, really filthy sense of humor. She was a vulgar woman. She used to tell me to do comedy before I even tried it. She was always up for any gag."
Doug Stanhope,,"I do good things in my life, too. It's just that none of them are funny."
Doug Stanhope,,"I go onstage, it's like I'm leading you into battle. You're not all going to be here at the end."
Doug Stanhope,drugs,"Drugs killed him, but they didn’t ruin his life by any stretch."
Doug Stanhope,,"If you start to smell some of the shit, you start smelling all of the shit."
Doug Stanhope,politics,"I think it's probably much easier to do political comedy from a two-party point of view, in that the majority have some sense of what it means to be one or the other."
Doug Stanhope,comedians,Doing stand-up takes the fun out of being funny.
Doug Stanhope,death,"I have no fear of death, except I hate waiting for it."
Doug Stanhope,,"You watch too much porno, it diminishes your taste for the kind of girls that will actually poon you."
Doug Stanhope,arguments,"Old people always tell you: 'When you've been around as long I have, then you can argue.' As soon as they're ripped off, it's a different story."
Doug Stanhope,,"Don't drink on weekends either... if you are gonna feel like shit tomorrow, drink Sunday through Thursday."
Doug Stanhope,,I sometimes wonder if necrophiliacs are really into dead people or if they just enjoy the quiet.
Doug Stanhope,"help,abortion","You want to help mother Earth? Try sodomy. Sodomy is eco-friendly, and abortion is green."
Doug Stanhope,,"Pussy really is the ultimate motivator of all mankind.  No, don’t clap, this is a flaw in the system!"
Doug Stanhope,,"If old people are so wise, how come they are always getting fucked by telemarketing fraud?"
Doug Stanhope,,"I don't have all the answers. I don't have a big closer, and I may not have a point. But I have a tit-fuck joke."
Doug Stanhope,,"Cunt is a great word, but it is more impressive if you use it on a guy."
Doug Stanhope,sisters,"Maybe it's instinctual to be monogamous; but if you know you are going to fuck her sister, maybe you should not be monogamous right yet."
Doug Stanhope,stupidity,I will call you stupid for not knowing shit that I just found out yesterday.
Doug Stanhope,,"The only legitimate excuse you could have for having a baby in those dire, war torn, famine struck conditions - would be to eat it."
Doug Stanhope,motivation,I'm a really fucking boring guy. I'm really good at doing nothing. I'm really not much of a drug guy anymore - I just don't have the time or need or access or motivation. I got bills. It sucks being an adult.
Doug Stanhope,,Yeah... Just get your shit together and start booking yourself again.
Doug Stanhope,complaints,"Complaining that a comic is drunk is like going to a titty bar and complaining because your lapdancer is a communist... who cares, the tits are out."
Doug Stanhope,,I don't fuck. Who needs it? I'm funnier without it.
Doug Stanhope,,"The key to a good life: excess in moderation. They’ll tell you moderation is the key to life, but that’s bullshit."
Doug Stanhope,,"Some people say, “Ya, I don’t have to drink to have a good time.” Okay ya, but that means you have to have a good time to have a good time."
Doug Stanhope,,The revolution I was starting where I thought I could yell at 200 people in a bar every night and change the world didn't quite happen.
Doug Stanhope,,Paralympics... fascinating because just watching anyone with a major disability trying to do everyday chores is fun to watch.
Doug Stanhope,,The acid I did in my twenties alone: I don't want to see the kind of baby this sperm is waiting to create.
Doug Stanhope,society,When you consider the overpopulation in this world... homosexuality is completely underrated in this society.
Doug Stanhope,,There's a fine line between being a sicko and an adventurous spirit.
Doug Stanhope,,I'm pretty drunk and bored with yelling at the stone walls that are your minds.
Doug Stanhope,asians,"When I say that asian women are beautiful it's not a sexual thing. I'm not being degrading, I find them sexually repulsive."
Doug Stanhope,,"Children are fucking animals, man... you don't believe me, put a three year old alone in a room with a kitten for an hour unattended."
Doug Stanhope,abortion,"'I'm against abortion, except like in cases of rape.' That's like saying, 'yes, a fetus is a human being, unless his dad is an asshole.'"
Doug Stanhope,life,"Life is like animal porn, it's not for everyone."
Doug Stanhope,,Ugly people face as much or more discrimination than any fucking minority group.
Doug Stanhope,immigration,"Fucking immigrants, all started with that Einstein... Once they brought him over from Germany and we didn't have any good genius jobs, it was a trickle-down effect."
Doug Stanhope,laws,"There should be no such thing as a vice law. Every vice is only a bad habit, and the punishment is inherent in the act."
Doug Stanhope,,"Fuck someone uglier than you every now and then, even if they don't deserve it; cos that makes people happy."
Doug Stanhope,,"I'm a bit of a potty mouth. My dad used to wash out my mouth with soap, but that was just to get rid of any traces of his DNA."
Doug Stanhope,,"Three times in ten years of comedy I've pulled my dick out or gone on stage naked, and it was appropriate at the time."
Doug Stanhope,,"I did fuck a midget once. It's true. Cos I had the opportunity after a show. How could you not, just one time, just to see."

Eddie Izzard,,"We have archeology on television, and I quite like it; it’s a sort of detective thing, but it’s really true, you know it’s there… But it’s kind of slow on telly, it has this problem of, “We’ve been here three weeks on live television, and we’ve taken off about a millimeter of top soil so far…” There’s men with brushes and beards… maybe they’ve just got beards, I’m not sure… “We found this and carbon-dated it to last Tuesday, so we’re very excited…”"

We should win that."

The calculator can add up with none of this fucking sliding the shit around and working out where that bit in the middle goes. Smash it over your head."""
Eddie Izzard,,"Makeup's just crazy, anyways. Native Americans used to wear it, and it did all right for them until, uh … well, until you killed them all, I suppose."
Eddie Izzard,women,"It’s a secret, religious, weird, ceremonial rite of passage for girls that women know. Hopscotch, it was bizarre for boys, ‘cause they never played it, and as a boy, I was behind walls, going, “What- what happened? What did they do? What do they do here?” And they had a track laid out with numbers, mystic numbers- 1, 5… 7, 8, you know… A bit of a broken doll there, some girl keeping lookout with a skipping rope…"
Eddie Izzard,,You're going to eat that later? You're going to take it home?

Eddie Izzard,,"And then earlier than that there were the crusades. The crusades were totally fucked. Richard the Lionheart, who had the heart of a lion as well as his own. He ripped it out of the lion, and the lion was left with a bicycle pump and not much to do."
Eddie Izzard,"differences,holocaust","If you commit perjury I don't care. Don't give a shit. I don't think you should because you grade murder. You have murder One. Murder Two. You realize that there can be a difference in the level of murder. So there must be a difference in the level of perjury.

Eddie Izzard,,"I use a Bruce Lee technique: 'The way of no way.' He had the idea that he would learn everything, so that whoever he had to fight, he could improvise anything. The best way of starting a gig is just to not think of anything - to clear your mind, not in an empty Zen state, but more just to go on and see where you go."
Eddie Izzard,,"Queen Victoria, one of our more frumpy Queen’s. They’re all frumpy aren’t they? Because it’s a bad idea when cousin’s marry."
Eddie Izzard,"life,religion",There was no religion in my life growing up. Did God invent us or did we invent God?
Eddie Izzard,,"So then there was the Greek, Socrates, he was great... He invented questioning. Before Socrates, no questioning. Everyone sort of went, ""Yeah, I suppose so."""
Eddie Izzard,,"Socrates was killed… by his own people. He was! Coz he questioned everything… ‘When is a house a house?’ ‘Just chill-out will you?’ ‘If I’m out of the house am I chilling-out? Am I chilling-in if I’m in the house? Ugg, ahhh.’ ‘What is a sword? Is it made of folded metal?' 'If I die on the floor can I get up in these heels?’"

Eddie Izzard,,"What I'm talking about is blasphemy! Blasphe-you! Blasphe-everybody in the room!... hm. 6 person joke, that. There we go."
Eddie Izzard,,"Words like ""kiosk"", that’s a Viking word and it came from when they would rape and pillage… 'cause they would rape and pillage and awful and blood everywhere and limbs hacked and money stolen, and then they’d say: ""If you have enjoyed today’s experience, you can get some souvenirs in the kiosk which is just down on the beach. Thank you, thank you."""
Eddie Izzard,,"You know, Catholicism, we believed in the teachings of Cathol, and everything it stood for..."
Eddie Izzard,,You killed a hundred thousand people? You must get up very early in the morning! I can't even get down the gym!
Eddie Izzard,,"Today's sermon is taken from a magazine that I found... that I found in a hedge. This season's lipstick colours will be in the frosted pink area - and nails to match... and this reminds me rather of our lord Jesus. Because, surely, when Jesus rode into town on a donkey... he must have gotten tarted up a bit."
Eddie Izzard,hitler,"Hitler ended up in a ditch covered in petrol on fire... so, that's fun. And that's funny. Because he was a mass-murdering fuckhead!"

Eddie Izzard,,"Cause if you're a transvestite, you're actually a male tomboy, that's where the sexuality is. Yeah, it's not drag queen, no; gay men have got that covered. This is male tomboy, and people do get that mixed up, they put transvestite there - no no no no! Little bit of a crowbar separation, thank you! And gay men, I think, would agree. It's male lesbian, that's really where it is, ok? Because… it's true! ‘Cause most transvestites fancy girls, fancy women. So that's where it is."
Eddie Izzard,,They’re not women’s clothes. They’re my clothes. I bought them.
Eddie Izzard,,"So … uh … I'd better explain the tits. Um … didn't have those at school. Wanted to, but not in the school curriculum … even though I asked."
Eddie Izzard,,"Father, bless me for I have sinned, I did an original sin… I poked a badger with a spoon."
Eddie Izzard,men,"My sexuality is straight transvestite or male lesbian. It seems we are beyond the idea that I am gay and hiding it. If I had to describe how I feel in my head, I'd say I'm a complete boy plus half a girl. I don't seem to have the sixth sense that women have or their stronger senses of taste and smell. Gay men can also have it but straight men don't."
Eddie Izzard,brain,"My Gran said put a thimble on your finger and it helps you in case you slip with the needle and it goes up, into the brain, and death."
Eddie Izzard,toasters,"The same people who make toasters make showers. For they have a turney button too that lies. For we all know turn turn turn turn for hot. Turn turn turn turn for cold. But the only position we're interested in is the position between there... and there. One nanomillimeter between fantastically hot, and fucking freezing."
Eddie Izzard,toasters,"So then God created the world, and on the first day he created light and air and fish and jam and soup and potatoes and haircuts and arguments and small things and rabbits and people with noses and jam – more jam, perhaps – and soot and flies and tobogganing and showers and toasters and grandmothers and, uh … Belgium. And the second day he created fire and water and eggnog and radiators and lights and Burma and things that go ""urh"" and … and Colonel Gaddafi and Arthur Negus. On the third day he probably got lists and said, ""I can't remember what I've invented now. I've just been ad-libbing so far."""
Eddie Izzard,,He did apologise for the Spanish Inquisition. He said it was far too inquisitive. Supposed to be the Spanish Casual Chat.

Eddie Izzard,football,"I think on the seventh day, God was running around, going, “Oh, my God! What haven’t I…? Rwanda! I better create Rwanda! Sorry, haven’t quite done that… The Tower of Pisa! Oh, it’s leaning… Oh, shi… done! Toilets in French camping sites… there we go. English football hooligans… there we go, whatever that is… Mrs. Thatcher’s heart… there we go… oh, fuck that! I know, I’ll put a stone in, that’ll work! There we go…” The next week, I think, people are coming back, going, “Rwanda doesn't work very well; infrastructure’s fucked.”"

Now, I know what you're gonna say, but stick with me. My story gets better. Second wife, I'm gonna kill her! Cut her head off. Ah, not expecting that, are we? Third wife gonna shoot her. Fourth wife, put her in a bag. Fifth wife, into outer space. Sixth wife, on a rotissamat. Seventh wife, made out of jam..."" and the Pope is saying, ""You crazy bugger! You can't do all this, what are you a Mormon? It's illegal. What have you been reading? The gospel according to St. Bastard?"""
Eddie Izzard,hitler,"Pol Pot killed one point seven million Cambodians, died under house arrest, well done there. Stalin killed many millions, died in his bed, aged seventy-two, well done indeed. And the reason we let them get away with it is they killed their own people. And we're sort of fine with that. Hitler killed people next door. Oh, stupid man. After a couple of years we won't stand for that, will we?"
Eddie Izzard,,"I'm an action transvestite really, so it's running, jumping, climbing trees... putting on make-up when you're up there!"
Eddie Izzard,racism,"It proves that we're all from Africa, you see. Proved through the Y chromosome and through the mitochondrial DNA that we're all African, which is brilliant 'cause it means that racist people can retire."
Eddie Izzard,,"When you're coming out, you have to deal with the whole world saying 'Oh! You're an abominable snowman'."
Eddie Izzard,coffee,"You say, ""Do you want a cup of coffee?"" and she says, ""Yeah, okay."" Then sex is on, yes? Doesn't always work, though. If the President of Barundi says do you want a cup of coffee..."
Eddie Izzard,,"What? … The Carthaginians are attacking? God, I knew they'd do that. What? … They are attacking over the Alps? Damn, I knew they'd do that. What? … They're coming on elephants? … Where'd they get the elephants? There aren't any elephants in Europe. This I got to see … are you sure? … It's not just a typo mistake? Perhaps the Carthaginians are attacking over the Alps and they are in their element? Kind of upbeat, you know. They're coming on fucking elephants, huh."
Eddie Izzard,,Boy bands should be exploded from a great height. They're just pretty people singing music written by others.
Eddie Izzard,immigration,I don't know what it's like in the U.S. but immigrants in the U.K. do the jobs the citizens won't do.
Eddie Izzard,,I don't believe that competitions are important.
Eddie Izzard,,I felt audiences are happier to take comedy people who play darker people because there's a link between the psychosis of comedy and the psychosis of being a twisted character.
Eddie Izzard,,"I mean, sometimes... a comedian becomes an actor, and they just don't deliver, because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny, and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful, and they get that mixed up sometimes, or don't even notice that that's the thing."
Eddie Izzard,religion,I try to just talk about human stories and what I think about religion or teapots or whatever.
Eddie Izzard,,"I try to keep performing as much as possible - I just like to. I used to take huge gaps off between gigs, now I just like to do stand-up gigs as much as I can."
Eddie Izzard,,I wanted to be less well-known in comedy.
Eddie Izzard,,I'd be happy to be taken as a woman - and that's what I was initially trying to do when I started throwing on dresses and stuff. But that wasn't going to happen because everyone kept calling me sir. So I thought I'd change the method and just start wearing what I wanted to wear.
Eddie Izzard,,"I'm quite good at taking in information so I voraciously inhale Wikipedia - which may have some things wrong in it, but I think is generally more information than we had before. Last tour we didn't have Wikipedia. And then Discovery Channel and History Channel. I can take it in and retain what I think are the most important facts."
Eddie Izzard,,"If you get anything creative going, then the work and play thing is the same thing, I feel."
Eddie Izzard,,"In stand-up it really helps to play yourself and talk about your own feelings. You cannot fail to be original if you're just talking about what you think about X, Y and Z. Unless you've got a twin brother who's also a stand-up."
Eddie Izzard,comedians,"My stand-up is quite good now, people say. It's just like a big conversation each time. Every gig is a rehearsal."
Eddie Izzard,,"Well, comedy is a great weapon of attack. It's not a great weapon of support."
Eddie Izzard,,"So in Europe, we had empires. Everyone had them - France and Spain and Britain and Turkey! The Ottoman Empire, full of furniture for some reason. And the Austro-Hungarian Empire, famous for fuck all! Yes, all they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard."

Eddie Izzard,language,"For those of you who don't speak French, by the way, all of that was fucking funny."
Eddie Izzard,,"So I've learnt that the world is 4500 million years old. If you're very religious, then it's not 4500 million years old, it's 6000 years old. One of these is not correct."
Eddie Izzard,,I can go from blokey to girlie in 15 minutes and then I'm out the door. But that's the fastest I can do it. Becoming a woman takes work.

That's just logic. That's just mathematical. And T-sus would always be fucking about. And P-sus does deliveries. C-sus started the Roman Empire. Cae-sus. F-sus, City in Turkey. B-sus was covered in something. Some people applauding there; other people going, ""What?"" ... B-sus was covered in bees."
Eddie Izzard,,"But then the Roman Empire fell like this- ""oh shit"". And we went into what the historians called the Stupid Fucker period. Where everyone was going -""er, I dunno. Is that a Roman road? Can we eat it?"" Then there was the dark Ages. "" I can't even see you! Where are you?"""
Eddie Izzard,toasters,Never put a sock in a toaster.

Ellen DeGeneres,,Do things that make you happy within the confines of the legal system.
Ellen DeGeneres,happiness,The thing everyone should realize is that the key to happiness is being happy for yourself and yourself.
Ellen DeGeneres,patients,"I'd like to be more patient! I just want everything now. I've tried to meditate, but it's really hard for me to stay still. I'd like to try to force myself to do it, because everybody says how wonderful meditation is for you, but I can't shut my mind up. So patience and learning is the key."
Ellen DeGeneres,,I hope I make people feel better. I hope I take people out of their situations a little bit and make them happier. That's really why I do what I do.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Above all things physical, it is more important to be beautiful on the inside - to have a big hear and an open mind and a spectacular spleen."
Ellen DeGeneres,dogs,"My dog of 17 years just died. Oh you're kidding?.. No... as funny as that is, I'm not."
Ellen DeGeneres,,Why is it that when you wipe up dust its called dusting but when you wipe up a spill its not called spilling? Just something to think about.
Ellen DeGeneres,change,"Things will get easier, people's minds will change, and you should be alive to see it."
Ellen DeGeneres,,I gotta work out. I keep saying it all the time. I keep saying I gotta start working out. It's been about two months since I've worked out. And I just don't have the time. Which uh... is odd. Because I have the time to go out to dinner. And uh... and watch tv. And get a bone density test. And uh... try to figure out what my phone number spells in words.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"The good psychic would pick up the phone before it rang. Of course it is possible there was noone on the other line. Once she said ""God Bless you"" I said, ""I didn't sneeze"" She looked deep into my eyes and said, ""You will, eventually."" And damn it if she wasn't right. Two days later I sneezed."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I have the worst memory ever so no matter who comes up to me - they're just, like, 'I can't believe you don't remember me!' I'm like, 'Oh Dad I'm sorry!'"
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Don't give advice. It will come back and bite you in the butt. Don't take anyone's advice. So, my advice to you is to be true to yourself and everything will be fine."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Friends will write me letters. They run out of room on the front of the letter. They write 'over' on the bottom of the letter. Like I'm that much of a moron. Like I need that there. Because if it wasn't there, I'd get to the bottom of the page: 'And so Kathy and I went shopping and we' That's the craziest thing! I don't know why she would just end it that way."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I see those picketers, and I think you know, if I weren't a loving, non-violent, spiritual person, I would really go over there and grab those signs and smash them over their heads and shove them up their asses. But... I'm a loving, spiritual person."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I'm feeling so good. I feel like a million bucks. I'm focused, I'm alert, I'm zippy and top of my game. I've never felt better! I'm sharp as a tack right now. And what's weird is that I didn't get a good nights sleep last night. And they say that's the most important thing. Or is it breakfast they said? That's the most important meal of the day, breakfast... yes. And then it's 'i' before 'e' I know that. Um... diamonds are a girl's best friend. Dog is a man's best friend.. What was I talking about? Oh, that's right, that I feel great and I'm at the top of my game. And it's odd because I didn't get hardly any sleep last night. And, they say that's the most important thing."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"The sixties were when hallucinogenic drugs were really, really big. And I don't think it's a coincidence that we had the type of shows we had then, like The Flying Nun."
Ellen DeGeneres,,You know me. Any excuse to put on a dress.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I get paid very well for an amazing, amazing life. I'm blessed."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I think the hard thing about stand-up - I mean, I think this part is great - but that the traveling is y'know, 'cause - 'cause I'm gone a lot from home and this time I'm out for three-and-a-half weeks without going home, and that's hard, to be gone three-and-a-half weeks 'cause then I have to ask my friends, ""Would you mind going to the house and watering the plants, and turn some lights on and make it look like somebody's home, and make sure that the mobile over the crib isn't tangled or the baby's gonna get bored..."" "

Ellen DeGeneres,holidays,"Nothing says holidays, like a cheese log."
Ellen DeGeneres,happiness,"Life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows.

Ellen DeGeneres,,The only way a no-legged leopard could hurt you is if it fell out of a tree onto your head.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I cannot believe they haven't yet come up with a better screening process than the mammogram. If a man had to put his special parts inside a clamp to test him for anything, I think they would come up with a new plan before the doctor finished saying, ""Put that thing there so I can crush it."
Ellen DeGeneres,animals,"If we're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, there's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"My point is, life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows. The pina and the colada."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I still get scared at night. Every tiny creak, every little noise, I open my eyes real wide and listen with them. Have you noticed that? When it’s dark and you can’t see a thing, you open your eyes really wide and glance back and force, like your eyes become your ears?"
Ellen DeGeneres,decisions,Quick decision makers are often stuck behind annoying people in line at Starbucks.
Ellen DeGeneres,stuff,"When I look back on the stuff I used to wear, I wonder why somebody didn't try to stop me. Just a friendly warning, ""You may regret this,"" would have been fine."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Way back in the day, like in the 1990s, if you wanted to tell everyone you ate waffles for breakfast, you couldn’t just go on the internet and tweet it out. There was only one way to do it. You had to go outside and scream at the top of your lungs, 'I ate waffles for breakfast!' That’s why so many people ended up in institutions. They seemed crazy, but when you think about it, they were just ahead of their time."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Though you feel you're not where you're suppose to be, you shouldn't worry because that next turn that you take, it will lead you to where you wanna go."

Ellen DeGeneres,,Haters are my motivators.
Ellen DeGeneres,help,It always helps to think about other people instead of ourselves.

Ellen DeGeneres,,"You know, it's hard work to write a book. I can't tell you how many times I really get going on an idea, then my quill breaks. Or I spill ink all over my writing tunic."
Ellen DeGeneres,,I've been trying to find women writers for my staff for a while now and I have three women on my staff and three guys so it's pretty equal. I don't know why that is. It's been the same thing for a while. It's hard for female comedians to stand out. That's weird. That's a shame.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Trying to get the talk show, looking back on it, we had to beg a lot of station managers to pick up the show because people thought no one would watch it because I'm openly gay."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Then you have these people in the movie theaters that talk the whole time during the movie. You ever go with somebody like that to a movie but you don't realize until you get there that you're with somebody like that? Brand new movie. First day it's open. You're there together and the entire time they're sitting there: ""Where's she going? Why'd he do that? Is he mad at her?"" ""I don't know, let's watch and find out together shall we?"" You know who you are. You're denying it right now: ""I do not do that. Why is she saying that?. What's she gonna say next?"""
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I was in yoga the other day. I was in full lotus position. My chakras were all aligned. My mind is cleared of all clatter and I'm looking out of my third eye and everything that I'm supposed to be doing. It's amazing what comes up, when you sit in that silence. 'Mama keeps whites bright like the sunlight, Mama's got the magic of Clorox 2.'"
Ellen DeGeneres,,"And now I've got to explain the smell that was in there before I went in there. Does that ever happen to you? It's not your fault.

Ellen DeGeneres,acceptance,Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"They say you just stand over there, he'll say thank you and you walk back off and that's what I thought was gonna happen, but in my head, I had for five or six years known that he was gonna call me over."
Ellen DeGeneres,"success,driving","When I was younger I thought success was something different. I thought, ""When I grow up, I want to be famous. I want to be a star. I want to be in movies. When I grow up I want to see the world, drive nice cars. I want to have groupies."" But my idea of success is different today. For me, the most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity and not to give into peer pressure, to try to be something that you're not. To live your life as an honest and compassionate person. To contribute in some way."
Ellen DeGeneres,women,"You have to have funny faces and words, you can't just have words. It is a powerful thing, and I think that's why it's hard for people to imagine that women can do that, be that powerful."
Ellen DeGeneres,aggression,"Comedy can be, especially in a writer's room, really aggressive, kind of a very male-dominated room, and it would be hard for women. It's not a nurturing place. It's not like a lot of women are going to say, I can't wait to live that lifestyle and be in a writer's room until 2 or 3 a.m."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Here's the analogy. If my body were a car, I'd be thinking about trading it in around now. I would like to upgrade. I would be actually on the lot somewhere and some guy with a loud sports jacket would be sizing me up... kinda looking around going maybe kicking my knees. Looking behind me going: ""That looks a little bashed in back there...Yeah. You mind if I check under the hood?"" ""Well yes I do! Thank you very much."""
Ellen DeGeneres,,"In the 80's we had high, high, waisted pants, that if they came up any higher they'd have to go up another size, if you know what I mean."
Ellen DeGeneres,"friends,comedians,problems","I have a terrible problem with procrastination... a friend told me, ""Well, you should go to therapy. And I thought about it, but then I said, ""Wait a minute. Why should I pay a stranger to listen to me talk when I can get strangers to pay to listen to me talk?"" And that's when I got the idea of touring."

Ellen DeGeneres,,"What goes up must come down, which is why I don't wear tube tops."
Ellen DeGeneres,animals,"People love their animals so much so that they put little clothes on them and necklaces and booties and things like that. And if you love your animal, then you should feed them something that's not dangerous for them. There's a lot of poisonous stuff that they're putting in a lot of that food, those by-products."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I'm glad I'm funny. I'm glad I make people happy, because that's very important. But I'm most proud to be known as a kind person... Because kindness spreads, and the world is a little nicer out there."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"But seriously, I think overall in the scheme of things winning an Emmy is not important. Let's get our priorities straight. I think we all know what's really important in life - winning an Oscar."
Ellen DeGeneres,,I've got a lot to say about television. There's a lot going on in television right now and I feel like a huge part of television.

Ellen DeGeneres,,"I look at anything in nature and how things work-the stars, the pyramids-and I can't imagine that there's not some kind of design to it all. There's got to be something big that we don't understand. I do believe in Jesus. I believe in being good to one another. Life is about spending our time here contributing and not taking away. That's my faith."
Ellen DeGeneres,,Some of the most devastating things that happen to you will teach you the most.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Haiku sounds like I'm saying hi to someone named Ku. Hi, Ku. Hello."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Even before I knew I was gay, I knew I didn't want to have a child. I knew I didn't want to have one. I never want to have to release it from me. Listen, I love babies. I love children. And I melt when I'm around them. I also love my freedom and I love that I can sleep at night."
Ellen DeGeneres,judgment,"I am saddened by how people treat one another and how we are so shut off from one another and how we judge one another, when the truth is, we are all one connected thing. We are all from the same exact molecules."
Ellen DeGeneres,work,"I work really hard at trying to see the big picture and not getting stuck in ego. I believe we're all put on this planet for a purpose, and we all have a different purpose... When you connect with that love and that compassion, that's when everything unfolds."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"So many people prefer to live in drama because it's comfortable. It's like someone staying in a bad marriage or relationship - it's actually easier to stay because they know what to expect every day, versus leaving and not knowing what to expect."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"In the beginning there was nothing. God said, 'Let there be light!' And there was light. There was still nothing, but you could see it a whole lot better."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I ask people why they have deer heads on their walls. They always say because it's such a beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother is attractive, but I have photographs of her."
Ellen DeGeneres,,Who needs sleep? I laugh in the face of sleep!
Ellen DeGeneres,,"The first person I learned I could make happy with laughter was my mother, whom I idolize. It was a powerful thing to realize. I knew I had found my life's work."
Ellen DeGeneres,challenges,It's our challenges and obstacles that give us layers of depth and make us interesting. Are they fun when they happen? No. But they are what make us unique. And that's what I know for sure... I think.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I don't want to take a pill. Go to Africa, go follow some bushman around. He's being chased by a lion. That's stress. You're not going to find a pygmy on Paxil, I'll tell you that right now."
Ellen DeGeneres,embarrassment,Sometimes the greatest things are the most embarrassing.
Ellen DeGeneres,hollywood,"I had a really tough time for a few years. My show was gone. My phone wasn't ringing. There wasn't one job offer. And at that point, I thought I knew for sure that I wouldn't work in Hollywood again."
Ellen DeGeneres,"confidence,change","Actually, there's nothing I know for sure because I know for sure that things change."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"The first time probably people really were aware of me, I unfortunately had the title of Showtime's Funniest Person in America. And that's a really tough title to travel around with when you're not even known."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Right before I decided to come out, I went on a spiritual retreat called 'Changing the Inner Dialogue of Your Subconscious Mind.' I'd never been to anything like it before, and all my friends were taking bets on how long I'd last with no TV, no radio, no phone. But for me that was the beginning of paying attention to all the little things."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"If you want to get rid of stuff, you can always do a good spring-cleaning. Or you can do what I do. Move."
Ellen DeGeneres,,I've moved about 10 times over the past 15 years. I don't move for the sole purpose of getting rid of stuff. I'm not crazy. I also move so that I never have to wash any windows.

Ellen DeGeneres,politics,"I think anybody who wants to be president has to be a politician, but I would like to find somebody who's coming from a loving place instead of a political place."
Ellen DeGeneres,kids,"I just feel like every kid is growing up too fast and they're seeing too much. Everything is about sex, and that's fine for me. I'm not saying I don't like it. But I don't think it should be everywhere, where kids are exposed to everything sexual. Because they have to have some innocence; there's just no innocence left."
Ellen DeGeneres,birthday,"I don't pay attention to the number of birthdays. It's weird when I say I'm 53. It just is crazy that I'm 53. I think I'm very immature. I feel like a kid. That's why my back goes out all the time, because I completely forget I can't do certain things anymore - like doing the plank for 10 minutes."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I do like men and I had, you know, a guy in high school that I wanted to marry desperately. He's the mayor of some small town in Texas. I could be the mayor's wife right now."

Ellen DeGeneres,,I think there's too much mult-tasking going on. I think people need to quiet down and focus and be still more.

Ellen DeGeneres,,Be kind to one another.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I don't understand the sizes anymore. There's a size zero, which I didn't even know that they had. It must stand for: 'Ohhh my God, you're thin.'"

Ellen DeGeneres,"happiness,brain","Now, I'm no scientist, but I know what endorphins are. They're tiny little magical elves that swim through your blood stream and tell funny jokes to each other. When they reach your brain,you hear what they're saying and that boosts your health and happiness. ""Knock Knock... Who's There?.. Little endorphin... Little endorphin who?... Little Endorphin Annie."" And then the endorphins laugh and then you laugh. See? It's Science."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"The problem with labels is that they lead to stereotypes and stereotypes lead to generalizations and generalizations lead to assumptions and assumptions lead back to stereotypes. It’s a vicious cycle, and after you go around and around a bunch of times you end up believing that all vegans only eat cabbage and all gay people love musicals."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"While I was doing stand-up, I thought I knew for sure that success meant getting everyone to like me. So I became whoever I thought people wanted me to be. I'd say yes when I wanted to say no, and I even wore a few dresses."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important."
Ellen DeGeneres,,Take a nap in a fireplace and you'll sleep like a log.
Ellen DeGeneres,acceptance,Accept who you are. Unless you're a serial killer.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I get bored easily, so I need to do a lot. I've started a record label, so I get to nurture new talent and talk about music, which is a passion of mine. I've written another book. And I get to come to work and do the TV show, which is always really fun."
Ellen DeGeneres,"truth,soul","Find out who you are and be that person. That's what your soul was put on this Earth to be. Find that truth, live that truth and everything else will come."

Ellen DeGeneres,,"You're not going to find a Pygmie on Paxal, I'll tell you that."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"And we certainly don't have full conversations on cellphones. You know? Usually the reception is so bad, but it's only bad on your side. The person talking to you has no clue. They're just rambling on and on. You've got your finger jammed in your ear, you're shushing people on the streets. You're ducked behind a dumpster so you can hear about your friend's new hair cut. ""What about the bangs are they shorter?! Are the bangs shorter?! The bangs!"""
Ellen DeGeneres,,"So, I bought a new CD and I was trying to get it open but couldn't with all the layers... I mean plastic and then tape and the tape is like government tape. It says open here... is that sarcasm?, and buy batteries and they are in there with layers and layers of cardboard and then scissors... you need scissors to get into scissors, what if you were buying them for the first time? you wouldn't be able to get them open. Then you try and buy a light bulb and it's this thin thin cardboard... what are they thinking? ""Oh, they'll be fine."""
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Procrastination is not the problem. It is the solution. It is the universe's way of saying stop, slow down, you move too fast. Listen to the music. Whoa whoa, listen to the music. Because music makes the people come together, it makes the bourgeois and the rebel. So come on people now, smile on your brother, everybody try to love one another. Because what the world needs now is love, sweet love. And I know that love is a battlefield, but boogie on reggae woman because you're gonna make it after all. So celebrate good times, come on. I've gotta stop I've gotta come to my senses, I've been out riding fences for so long... oops I did it again... um... What I'm trying to say is, if you leave tonight and you don't remember anything else that I've said, leave here and remember this: Procrastinate now, don't put it off."

But that's their job and they have to read these stories and they're just coming up on the teleprompter they don't know what's coming up. And they have to go through these change of emotions. That.. ""There were no survivors... And next Which candybar helps ya lose weight! Still to come! Is an asteroid headed towards earth... But first where to find the cheesiest pizza in town! Also, a disturbing study finds that studies are disturbing..."""

Ellen DeGeneres,,"I swear if Colgate comes out with one more type of toothepaste. I just want clean teeth that's all I want. I don't want the tartar and I don't want the cavaties. And I want white teeth. How come I have to choose? And then they have the 'Colgate Total' that supposedly has everything in there. I don't believe that for one second. If it's all in the one, how come they make all the others? Who's going: ""I don't mind the tartar so much.""?"
Ellen DeGeneres,,"It's funny how cucumber water can taste so much better than pickle juice, even though they come from the same source."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"We have two dogs, Mabel and Wolf, and three cats at home, Charlie, George and Chairman.

Ellen DeGeneres,,"Most comedy is based on getting a laugh at somebody else's expense. And I find that that's just a form of bullying in a major way. So I want to be an example that you can be funny and be kind, and make people laugh without hurting somebody else's feelings."
Ellen DeGeneres,gays,"I was raised around heterosexuals, as all heterosexuals are, that's where us gay people come from... you heterosexuals."

Ellen DeGeneres,,"Golden eagles have an interesting way of mating, where they connect in the air while flying at eighty miles an hour and then they start dropping and they don't stop dropping until the act is completed. So it's not uncommon that they both fall all the way to the ground, hit the ground and both of them die. That's how committed they are to this. I thought to myself, 'Boy, don't we feel like wimps for stopping to answer the phone.' I don't know about you, but if I'm one of these two birds, you're getting close to the ground... I would seriously consider faking' it."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Have you ever heard somebody sing some lyrics that you've never sung before, and you realize you've never sung the right words in that song? You hear them and all of a sudden you say to yourself, 'Life in the Fast Lane?' That's what they're saying right there? You think, 'why have I been singing 'wipe in the vaseline?' how many people have heard me sing 'wipe in the vaseline?' I am an idiot."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"People always ask me, 'Were you funny as a child?' Well, no, I was an accountant."
Ellen DeGeneres,,I learned compassion from being discriminated against. Everything bad that's ever happened to me has taught me compassion.
Ellen DeGeneres,,People are constantly asking Portia and me if we are going to have children. We thought about it. We love to be around children after they've been fed and bathed. But we ultimately decided that we don't want children of our own. There is far too much glass in our house.
Ellen DeGeneres,golf,There would be nothing to get me to run for president. I don't even understand how anyone would want that job at all. Although I would be able to play golf which I don't seem to have time now.

Ellen DeGeneres,"birthday,christmas","If your Birthday is on Christmas day and you're not Jesus, you should start telling people your birthday is on June 9 or something. Just read up on the traits of a Gemini. Suddenly you're a multitasker who loves the color yellow. Because not only do you get stuck with them combo gift, you get the combo song.

Ellen DeGeneres,driving,"Sometimes when I am driving I get so angry at inconsiderate drivers that I want to scream at them. But then I remember how insignificant that is, and I thank God that I have a car and my health and gas. That was phrased wrong - normally you wouldn't say, thank God I have gas."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Our egos tells us we're the only ones that have any kind of feelings. We're the only ones with a relationship. We're the only ones with family. You know, I think that if you kill a spider, there is a relationship that you're ruining. There's a conversation going on outside with the other spiders. 'Did you hear about Chris?.... Killed yeah... .Sneaker. And now Stephanie has nine hundred babies to raise all alone. Well, she's got her legs full I'll tell you that right now. Chris was so kind, wouldn't hurt a fly. It's just been tough for them lately. They just lost their web last week. Those humans think they're so smart. Let them try shooting silk out of their butt and see what they can make."
Ellen DeGeneres,terrorists,"We're told to go on living our lives as usual, because to do otherwise is to let the terrorists win, and really, what would upset the Taliban more than a gay woman wearing a suit in front of a room full of Jews?"
Ellen DeGeneres,,People love gossip. It's the biggest thing that keeps the entertainment industry going.

Ellen DeGeneres,,"We stock up on popcorn and candy like we're crossing the Sierras, don't we? ""I'll have a couple of soft pretzels, a hot dog, Milk Duds, Snocaps.

Ellen DeGeneres,intelligence,"My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom's not, and I'm not. But I believe in God, and that there's a higher power and an intelligence that's bigger than us and that we can rely on. It's not just us, thinking we are the ones in control of everything. That idea gives me support."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"We all feel like idiots at one time or another. Even if we feel we're cool 98 percent of the time, that 2-percent doofus is poised to take over our bodies without any warning."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I was raised in an atmosphere of 'everything's fine.' But as I got older, I was like, 'Well no, everything's not fine. There is stuff that's sad.' I am a really sensitive person. I think I am too sensitive sometimes."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"My cat, Ethel, is an indoor cat but somehow she's sneakin' out at night. 'Cause the other morning I found a stamp on her paw... I wouldn't have noticed myself, but I just bought this new black light and she passed right under it and I said, 'Hey, what's that on you paw?'"

Ellen DeGeneres,challenges,"Hosting the Emmys is a challenge for me. I guess it's the equivalent of someone who needs to climb a mountain or jump out of a plane. It's that kind of thing, where this could go terribly wrong. And I love the feeling of when it goes right."
Ellen DeGeneres,audience,"I just like observing people - it's something I've done ever since I was a kid, and I got really good at it. That's a big part of why I became a comedian. My audience is filled with every kind of person you can imagine, and I love that."
Ellen DeGeneres,,Designing is my hobby. If I didn't do what I do for a living - at some point when I don't do this for a living - I'll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture.
Ellen DeGeneres,politics,"I know that every time I list something that I am, I am potentially alienating a whole group of people. Publicists and managers will encourage you not to say what political party you belong to, what you eat, what you don't eat, who you sleep with and all that stuff."
Ellen DeGeneres,waitresses,"We went to lunch and were talking about procrastination and the waitress overheard us and she said, ""I have a problem with procrastination, too."" I said ""Really?... Get my sandwich."""
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Life is short. If you doubt me, ask a butterfly. Their average life span is a mere five to fourteen days."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I collect old portraits. They're all just interesting pictures of people, and you just kind of wonder who they were and what they were. There's a guy - I don't know who he is, but he's wearing a suit. He's got his arms folded, and he looks like he sold insurance or something. I'm just wondering why someone painted him."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"No matter how popular you are as a stand-up - you can go out and fill a 10,000-seat arena and be smart and funny - it's delicate to host an awards show and know where your place is and know that it's not about you, that it's about the people who are nominated, and respect that, but at the same time have your moment to show them who you are."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"The only thing that scares me more than space aliens is the idea that there aren't any space aliens. We can't be the best that creation has to offer. I pray we're not all there is. If so, we're in big trouble."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"Stuffed deer heads on walls are bad enough, but it’s worse when you see them wearing dark glasses, having streamers around their necks and a hat on their antlers. Because then you know they were enjoying themselves at a party when they were shot."
Ellen DeGeneres,"differences,life",It makes a big difference in your life when you stay positive.
Ellen DeGeneres,,"You know, it's hard work to write a book. I can't tell you how many times I really get going on an idea, then my quill breaks. Or I spill ink all over my writing tunic.

Ellen DeGeneres,love,"You know that song that asks, ""Why do fools fall in love?""? I think the obvious answer is because they're fools."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"There's lotion for your face, for your hands, for your feet, for your body. Why? What would happen if you put hand lotion on your feet? Would your feet get confused and start clapping? Each kind has something special in it - aloe, shea butter, coconut, cocoa butter, vanilla, lemon extract. That's not lotion. That's one ingredient short of a Bundt cake."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I guess I don't have to point this out, that it's the second time I've hosted the Emmys after a national tragedy. And I just want to say that I'm honored because it's times like this that we really need laughter."
Ellen DeGeneres,"judgment,happiness","The world is full of a lot of fear and a lot of negativity, and a lot of judgment. I just think people need to start shifting into joy and happiness. As corny as it sounds, we need to make a shift."

Ellen DeGeneres,,"You know how you always expect someone to think the same as you and then your like, really shocked when they don't? Like when it's a cold day and you turn to the person next to you and say, 'Its so cold, aren't you cold?' and then they say 'no.' It's kinda like, 'what, are you a communist?'"
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I love clothes, so when I wear clothes, they're usually somebody's. You know, I'm not wearing Kmart."
Ellen DeGeneres,honesty,"Here are the values that I stand for: honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values."
Ellen DeGeneres,acceptance,"Our flaws are what makes us human. If we can accept them as part of who we are, they really don't even have to be an issue."
Ellen DeGeneres,,"I believe everything in life is energy. If we're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, there's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that."

Emo Philips,,The battle of the sexes will never be won as long as we keep sleeping with the enemy.
Emo Philips,,"Well! I feel happy these days. I've started taking a herbal anti-depressant. It's called Saint John's Wort. Apparently it's the best-selling anti-depressant in many places. It's the most popular anti-depressant in Germany... After, I'm guessing, amnesia..."
Emo Philips,,"I was walking down the street, something caught my eye... and dragged it fifteen feet."

Emo Philips,,"Coming up with a funny joke is like falling in love: It can hit you any time, anywhere. Having said that, the more you put yourself out there, the better your odds will be."
Emo Philips,,"I don’t really hang out with people. I like to be by myself. In fact, I’ve been arrested a few times because I like to walk around at two or three in the morning, looking at shop windows. The cops take me to the station and fingerprint me. But I wouldn’t call that hanging out."
Emo Philips,,Writer’s block is a myth. I never see the gardeners suffering from gardening block.
Emo Philips,worth,If you’re worth over $50m you should have to dress like that guy on the Monopoly box. The super-rich shouldn’t get all the benefits of looking like a regular guy.
Emo Philips,,"Nepal is the most fun place in the world. You’ve got monkeys roaming around, cremations and animal sacrifices. And there’s no vehicle that you’re not welcome to ride on top of. The country could have been invented by Beavis and Butt-head. Even the gods have nice breasts."
Emo Philips,,Charlie Chaplin is the greatest artist of the 20th century. He takes me from laughter to tears in seconds. And he was one of the very first funny men. It’s like the original violins were made in Cremona and there’s never been any better since. Sometimes the best come right off the bat.
Emo Philips,,"People come up to me and say, ""Emo, do people really come up to you?"""

Emo Philips,,"I used to think I knew everything, but older you get the more you see other areas. If you could read everything about both sides, you’ll pretty much be in the middle again, which is the state you had when you were totally ignorant.

Emo Philips,bible,"I'm very religious, you know. Now, OK, if by 'religious', you mean that I go to church every Sunday, read the bible faithfully, and I listen to Debbie Boone, umm, I'm not religious in that sense...

Take away fifteen minutes from that, and you begin to get an idea of what eternity is."

Emo Philips,,"I’m totally normal in every respect, but I have this one quirk - I can’t give out a number without laughing. It’s a problem when I’m giving my credit card number over the phone because they always think: ‘He must have just stolen it.’"

Eugene Mirman,,"People used to make fun of alternative comedy because sometimes it would be someone being funny, and sometimes it was a crazy man with a flute making no sense. And it's very easy to be like, ""yeah, that's not really comedy."""
Eugene Mirman,,"It's easy to sit on a mountaintop and tell people what to do and how to be happy. I have chosen to do that. Not because it's easy, but for a different reason, which I would reveal, if your mind was ready to handle it, which it isn't, which is also very convenient for me."
Eugene Mirman,,"I was at peace with it; I'd taken his hatred and insecurity-driven malice and turned it into fame, money, and of course, pussy."
Eugene Mirman,,Is the square root of hate the same thing as love times love?

Eugene Mirman,,"Oh, Hello. I'm Eugene Mirman, and I'm here to introduce my special. It's called ""An Evening of Comedy in a Fake Underground Laboratory""."
Eugene Mirman,,"I believe in diversification of income, because you never know what will happen. I’m a slightly paranoid person who thinks things could be ruined at any time."
Eugene Mirman,airports,"The good thing about being stuck at the airport for an extra hour, is that it gives you a chance to give weary travelers surprise massages."
Eugene Mirman,,I don’t know what it would be like to actually play guitar. I’ve toured with a lot of comedians and it’s never been like it is for a rock band.
Eugene Mirman,,"The only thing wrong with me was that I was a weirdo that hated school. I’m sure now there’d be a disorder for it, but I was just an oddball."
Eugene Mirman,judgment,I laugh at weird times - at good and bad things alike. I laugh simply when things are incongruous. It’s not necessarily a judgment - as it is noticing the oddity of something.
Eugene Mirman,abortion,"I saw this huge billboard that said: 'Abortion Hurts' and then it had a drawing of a butterfly. Who is that for?

Eugene Mirman,,Try not to wake up on fire.
Eugene Mirman,,"There's nothing sexier than a girl who's like, 'I know who FDR is, I know about the New Deal, I'm going to give you a new deal.' and then, over a period of years, she structures her sex acts in such a way that they save the economy."
Eugene Mirman,,"A comedian is simply a different kind of therapist. A comedian is a psychologist and a psychiatrist rolled into one. Except I can't prescribe medicine. You still need a doctorate, which is bullshit. Okay, so I'm not like a psychiatrist. Fine. But I'm still like a psychologist, except I can't diagnose or treat mental illness."

Eugene Mirman,neighborhood,"I was in Vancouver, and I was in what I was told was the poorest neighborhood in North America - which I find very hard to believe because has anyone here ever been to Detroit?"
Eugene Mirman,,"To create a comedy major, I ended up starting a comedy night in the basement of my dorm, and I promoted and produced my final project, which meant I faxed press releases from an old Apple IIC, or whatever it was, to newspapers, not knowing if that would work or if that's how you do things."
Eugene Mirman,,"Boys have penises and girls have vaginas. If they touch at the wrong time, you can make a baby or die."
Eugene Mirman,"neighborhood,restaurants","One of the best things I found out about Detroit is that bears have started returning to the city. When bears are gentrifying your neighborhood and opening Thai restaurants, that's a poor neighborhood."
Eugene Mirman,new york,I was driving back from Delaware to New York. Don't bother.
Eugene Mirman,"music,dancing",It's weird - the cab driver is playing very loud dance music and yet it doesn't really feel like a party.
Eugene Mirman,,"Think of me as an impetuous Hegel, drunk with power, and also, regular drunk."
Eugene Mirman,,Is it okay to go the roof of the tallest building in your town and jerk off into the street?

Eugene Mirman,,"I just loved comedy as a kid and I think at some point, it just occurred to me that you could try it, and I did."
Eugene Mirman,,Are you moving so quick now that it seems like time has stopped?
Eugene Mirman,,"One of the things that’s funniest about the entertainment industry and comedy is that people go ‘Oh, you’re great, but I don’t know what to do with you.’ The great thing about the Internet is that nobody has to figure out what to do with you. You can figure out what to do with you, and you can say, ‘I made this thing, and I’m going to put it out, and now if people want to come see me and buy things from me they can.’"
Eugene Mirman,,"You can do anything you want, as long as it works."

Eugene Mirman,,"A young senator came to me one Tuesday afternoon and said, ‘I want to be the next president of the United States.’ I looked at him, made him get into a sensory deprivation tank and answer a few deceptively simple questions, and after about an hour I said, ‘Okay, kid, let’s do this.’ That person, of course, was John F. Kennedy."
Eugene Mirman,,"High School: Oh, man. This is where boys and girls go from tweens to teens and become complicated and cruel. Girls play sick mind games; boys try to pull each other's penises off and throw them in the bushes. If you can, buy the most expensive jeans in a two-hundred-mile radius of your town and wear them on your first day. If anyone asks how you could afford them say that your father is the president of Ashton Kutcher. When they are like, 'Ashton Kutcher has a president?' answer, 'Yes.' Everyone will be in awe of you and you won't have to go through a lot of pain and cat fights."
Eugene Mirman,,I think that I would be a good father… especially if my baby liked to go out drinking.
Eugene Mirman,,"Let's start anew. Life is goals - Purpose-Attempts - Struggle-Dreams and Accomplishmenties. It sounds confusing (my fault), but it's actually simple."
Eugene Mirman,,"Some PR is about getting information about a great product or thingy out to the people who would enjoy it, while other PR is about creating a web of lies that conceals the fact that your company harnesses the energy produced by rape and uses it to make a chemical that kills forests for fun. Either way, you're going to need it."
Eugene Mirman,,"Prom night can be a special night, if you let it be. I know you think it's for losers and something that popular kids do because they are boring people with porcelain hearts who don't know what it means to be lonely. But you're wrong. Prom is a chance for everyone to try oral sex. Go for it."
Eugene Mirman,attitude,"In America, ""Qualification"" is simply an attitude. I've adopted it. So, yes. I am qualified."

Eugene Mirman,business,"I saw that Linens 'N Things was going out of business. I know. My first thought was, 'Should have been more specific.'"
Eugene Mirman,,"The truth is, for however much my stories come out of things that have happened to me, they're not darkly or as deeply personal as someone like Marc Maron or a lot of comedians, but they are essentially my life and my interpretation of it."
Eugene Mirman,,"Yes, I'm known as America's most genuine comedian."
Eugene Mirman,neighborhood,"There's this billboard in my neighborhood, and it says, 'Don't leave a baby anywhere,' which is true. I imagine the first rule of baby is to not leave it in the street. Don't even leave it with a knife or a sword - even Excalibur."
Eugene Mirman,love,"Marriage is when two people love each other so much that they promise that if they ever, ever stop they'll fill out tons of paperwork."
Eugene Mirman,,"I went to high school in Lexington, Massachusetts, which in hindsight was very nice."
Eugene Mirman,,You are an alchemist who can turn six beers into an awkward three week relationship.

Eugene Mirman,,You know how sometimes when you're drunk you say something you sort of regret... to Ace Frehley?
Eugene Mirman,future,"If this is airing in the future and no one knows who Karl Rove is, he's the reason you all live underground."
Eugene Mirman,audience,"For a short period of time, I was like, ""I have these jokes and if people get them, they get them."" And then eventually, I was like, ""Oh no. It's absolutely my job to convey to people why what I think is funny, is funny. The whole point of standup is to get the audience to understand your weird point of view."
Eugene Mirman,,"Most bullies are the product of a stressful and often abusive home life. Next time a bully threatens or attacks you, just yell, 'Don't abuse me like your parents abuse you!' Then call children's services and tell them you saw this bully crying in the bathroom and you're worried about him. Bam! He just got moved to a foster home."
Eugene Mirman,,"If you really really don’t like someone, like you really don’t like someone, buy them a pony. Cause, ""You know what, fuck you! Take care of this pony!"""
Eugene Mirman,marijuana,Some of the shit marijuana does - we had no idea. Pot doesn't just kill the person who smokes it. It kills everyone within a mile around.

Eugene Mirman,,"I forget, is freedom of speech when it's legal to say what you want or is it when it has no consequences for some reason?"

Good night, San Francisco. Good night, foreign countries with distribution from Comedy Central. I will now leave energetically to match your energy!"
Eugene Mirman,,I remember the first time I had sex. I wore a cape and goggles… because I didn’t know.
Eugene Mirman,abortion,"There was one woman who had a giant sign and on it, it just said, 'America Is Better Than Abortion.' I think she meant that America was too good a place for the horror of abortion. But instead, it sounded like she had weighed both - the American spirit and getting an abortion and decided that American spirit better. I think it is a bad idea to have grammatically ambiguous protest signs."
Eugene Mirman,,"I moved recently and I moved my cable and Internet and phone service which was all provided by Time Warner Cable. And you know, I made a plan with them where they'd come sometime between summer solstice and winter solstice and I would wait."
Eugene Mirman,dating,"You just can't make up random information and say it sarcastically and have it make sense. You can't just be like, 'I went out on a date with a Jewish girl. She was more rude than a wolfcat - an animal I've made up and decided is rude.'"
Eugene Mirman,politics,Imagine the wars we would've avoided if prior generations had a website where they could debate tragedy and politics in terse sentences?
Eugene Mirman,,"Don't get me wrong - I'll put $25 on the ground and then if you pick it up and we have sex in an alley, that's not a crime. That's a coincidence."
Eugene Mirman,,"When years from now people look back on today, they will think the same thing they already do but with more reasons for it."
Eugene Mirman,,You wanna know what a gateway drug is? It opens a gate.
Eugene Mirman,,"I don't have any rules, so don't invite me to game night."

Eugene Mirman,"market,hitler","I was in a fish market, and there was a little boy behind the counter, about nine, and he had a bucket of live fish. And he took one out and he put it in his mouth. All of a sudden, his mom, who I think owned the place, looked at him and said, 'What are you doing?' And to my surprise, he pointed at me and went, 'He dared me to!' His mom turns around and is like, 'Did you dare my son to put a live fish in his mouth?' 'No, first of all, if I dared your son to do something, he'd be dead. I wouldn't do a wimpy dare, like read a short story quickly. I'd have a real dare, like eat a bag of fire! Or build a time machine, jerk off in it and send it to Hitler!' That's a dare."
Felipe Esparza,,You know you're getting older when your haters now want to kill you.
Felipe Esparza,,"The war in Iraq is still going on. The British are helping. Mexico wants to help, but they need a ride over there."
Felipe Esparza,audience,"Every week for me was the same audience, and every week they heckled me. The better I got at comedy, the better the audience was at heckling me. But it helped me with my joke writing."
Felipe Esparza,,You are not a nerd you're just an asshole with glasses on.
Felipe Esparza,,We all have a best friend in here. Every man in here has a best friend. The only reason you hangout with him is because his life sucks more than yours.
Felipe Esparza,"immigration,police",The police pulled me over and asked me if I have anything illegal in my car. I looked at my cousin and I ran.
Felipe Esparza,,"I started drinking when I was like 15, and by the time I was 19 everybody knew I was an alcoholic. So I would start five fights every weekend and lose terribly. First you start off fighting with one person and then he beats you up; and then one guy would be laughing, so you would hit him, too."
Felipe Esparza,,I don't know any skinny people who bully fat people. I just know skinny people who use fat people for rides.

Felipe Esparza,police,I know I'm getting older because yesterday I called the police on my neighbors.
Felipe Esparza,,I didn’t know how to grab your best material and put it together into a comedy set. I would just choose subjects and do it onstage. That’s what I learned. I didn’t know how to put a set together.
Felipe Esparza,,"I gotta lose weight. I got stretch marks on my stomach and I never had a baby. So now when I take off my shirt in front of women, I tell them I was attacked by a mountain lion."
Felipe Esparza,"television,neighborhood","I love my dad. He used to walk around the whole neighborhood and collect old furniture and fix it, like MacGyver with duct tape. One time, he brought a television home. I said, 'Damn, that TV has 500 channels.' When I got older, it didn't have 500 channels - it was a knob from the oven. My favorite channel was 300 degrees."
Felipe Esparza,terrorists,I like to watch French movies with the volume up so my neighbors could think I'm terrorist.
Felipe Esparza,,I used to work at UPS I got fired for unloading packages into my car.

Felipe Esparza,immigration,If the immigration bill doesn't go through it is okay because we'll still go through.
Felipe Esparza,"love,wrestling","I love my dad. He used to be a professional wrestler in Mexico. So it was cool growing up with him, because when he hit us, he didn’t really hit us."
Felipe Esparza,,"You write some material, go up on stage and try it out; go back home and throw it in the trash can. And the next day do it again."
Felipe Esparza,,"I could never have a threesome. This is not a threesome body. This is a turn off the lights body, leave your shirt on body - this is a tell nobody."
Felipe Esparza,halloween,Halloween is the only day I can dress up like a hot Latina woman with a beer belly.
Felipe Esparza,sisters,If you have a fat brother or sister you might be American.
Felipe Esparza,,"My mom cooked the same food every day - tortillas, beans and meat. If it was enchiladas, it was - tortillas, beans and meat. If it was burritos, it was still - tortillas, beans and meat."
Felipe Esparza,beat,I got friends who look like life beat the shit out of them.
Felipe Esparza,cocaine,I envy people who could just have one drink and not go look for cocaine afterwards.
Felipe Esparza,,When my ugly friends say shit just got ugly I want to say damn uglier?
Felipe Esparza,cocaine,"We have chemical weapons in America too, they're called meth and cocaine."
Felipe Esparza,,That security guard can never tell me where to park. What does he know about parking? He can tell me where to stand.
Felipe Esparza,,I got a wedgie coming down from the ceiling in the swing and my leg fell asleep!
Felipe Esparza,,"I’m not a tough guy, but I can beat up everyone at Trader Joe’s, but at Food-for-Less I shut up. They don‘t have aisles, they have alleys."
Felipe Esparza,,I think I'm going to put baby powder all over my legs before this walk just to be safe.
Felipe Esparza,,Went to the beach and I bought ceviche and a boogie board from the same person.
Felipe Esparza,hate,"I hate when comedians use ""Performed For The Troops"" as one of there credits before they go up on stage."
Felipe Esparza,beat,My dad was one of those dads that would make me stop crying by threatening to beat me.
Felipe Esparza,mexicans,"I was born in Sinaloa, Mexico, along with two of my siblings. The rest were born here in the United States. I didn’t know we were illegal until I was in the 8th grade. We would call other kids wetbacks, but we were the real wetbacks!"
Felipe Esparza,,Rich people bring a lawyer. Latinos and blacks bring their mom.
Felipe Esparza,,"I listened to my first comedy album in 6th grade. It was Bill Cosby. My brother and I would play it over and over on a Fisher Price record player. A friend in high school also introduced me to Richard Pryor. I wasn’t writing material back then, but I would say funny stuff. I was good at making fun of people’s moms. If I knew something personal about you, it would be used against you."
Felipe Esparza,,"Yeah, people ask me about my hair, 'Felipe, what kind of shampoo do you use?' I say, 'I don't know. I think it's called 'SAMPLE, don't take.'"
Felipe Esparza,,"Women look at my brother because he's hot, and they get upset. 'He's gay? What a waste!' I say, 'Hey, I'm not gay.' 'What a shame.'"
Felipe Esparza,,I better start doing stand up comedy in Spanish before every comedian in Mexico translates my jokes.

Felipe Esparza,,"I've got three women in my life: my mama, ex baby mama and my new baby mama."
Felipe Esparza,,While everyone else was saying Trick or Treat my dad was telling us to say Triki Tras.

Felipe Esparza,,Thanksgiving is the day you don't know if you're invited for dinner or an intervention either way is going to be an ambush.
Felipe Esparza,,Cougar jokes are now as hackneyed as airplane food.
Felipe Esparza,"husband,marijuana",I used to sell marijuana to my son’s mom’s new husband. And then I would take that money and give it to her as child support.
Felipe Esparza,,I may not be the best dad but I taught my son how to get free samples at the mall.
Felipe Esparza,mexicans,"I also had a stuttering problem. In a Mexican home they don’t give you speech therapy; they don’t even know what speech therapy is. They just get the belt. If there’s a parrot in the house, you better talk better than the parrot."
Flight of the Conchords,,"Jen said she'd never ever see me again. When I saw her again, she said it again."
Flight of the Conchords,,"Other rappers diss me. Say my rhymes are sissy. What, what, what, why, why, why? Be more constructive with your feedback."
Flight of the Conchords,,"Bret, you got it goin' on! ""Got it goin' on!"" Not in a gay way but in a hey-your-lookin'-ok-man!"
Flight of the Conchords,,Sometimes love is as sweet as kalbi.
Flight of the Conchords,,"She's so hot. I wanna tell her she's hot, but she'll think I'm sexist. She's so hot, she's making me sexist... bitch."
Flight of the Conchords,,They're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers. But what's the real cost 'cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper. Why are we paying so much for sneakers when they're made by little slave kids? What are your overheads?
Flight of the Conchords,,"""You need to work on your people skills."" ""Shut up, Bret."""
Flight of the Conchords,rain,"I'm not crying, its just been raining... on my face."
Flight of the Conchords,,It's not till you get out on tour that you realize the impact.
Flight of the Conchords,heaven,2 minutes in heaven is better than 1 minute in heaven.
Flight of the Conchords,,"Everyday I look across the office floor, there you were, your hair down to your legs and your legs down the the floor."
Flight of the Conchords,,These aren't tears of sadness because you're leaving me - I've just been cutting onions. I'm making a lasange... for one.
Flight of the Conchords,,"Do you have one really punky sequinned jump-suit, Bowie, or do you have several ch-ch-changes?"
Flight of the Conchords,,"Love is like a roll of tape. It's real good for making two things one, but just like that roll of tape, love sometimes breaks off before you were done. Another way that love is similar to tape, that I've noticed is sometimes it's hard to see the end. You search on the roll with your fingernail."
Flight of the Conchords,,"My rhymes are so potent that in this small segment I made all of the ladies in the area pregnant. Yes, sometimes my lyrics are sexist but you lovely bitches and hos should know I'm trying to correct this."
Flight of the Conchords,,"Making love… making love for… making love for two… making love for two minutes. When you’re with me, girl, you only need two minutes, because I’m so intense."
Flight of the Conchords,audience,"We really see the live shows as something totally separate from the TV show, even if the audience may not see it that way."
Flight of the Conchords,,"Will somebody get the knife and fork out of my leg, please? Can somebody please remove these cutleries from my knees?"
Flight of the Conchords,,"I'm the Hippopotamus, my lyrics are bottomless!"
Flight of the Conchords,tea,There ain't no party like my nana's tea party.
Flight of the Conchords,,"What man? Which man? Whose the man? When's a man a man? What makes a man a man? Am I a man? yes, technically I am."
Flight of the Conchords,,My friend just told me he thought I was easily offended. I just can't believe he said that.
Flight of the Conchords,,"And if I am crying, it's not cuz of you, it's because I'm thinking about a friend of mine, who you don't know, who is dying, that's right dying."
Flight of the Conchords,,"No one cares, no one sympathsizes, you just stay home and play synthisizers."
Flight of the Conchords,business,"You know when I'm down to my socks it's time for business. That's why they're called business socks. It's business, it's business time."
Flight of the Conchords,,You're so beautiful. You could be a part time model. But you'd probably still have to keep your normal job.
Flight of the Conchords,,"A kiss is not a contract, but its very nice. Just because you've been exploring my mouth doesn't mean you get to take an expedition for the south."
Flight of the Conchords,,"Boogie, boogie, aw yeah, Robo-Boogie."
Flight of the Conchords,,"""Yeah my dad was a Women's Rights Activist."" ""Your dad?"" ""Yup."" ""Not your mum?"" ""No... Dad would have never allowed that."""
Flight of the Conchords,prostitutes,You’re so beautiful like a tree or a high class prostitute.
Flight of the Conchords,,Let's get in a cab. I'll buy you a kebab. Now I can't believe I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. With a kebab.
Flight of the Conchords,,Why can't a heterosexual guy tell a heterosexual guy that he thinks his booty is fly?
Flight of the Conchords,,"Just want to do something special, for all the ladies of the world, and the girls... Carribean... Parisian... Bolivian... Eastern Indochinian... Reptilian... Presbyterian."
Flip Wilson,violence,Violence is a tool of the ignorant.
Flip Wilson,,The cost of living is going up and the chance of living is going down.
Flip Wilson,,"With all the trouble black people have, they try to forget on weekends. You've got to be good to make them laugh."
Flip Wilson,,You can't expect to hit the jackpot if you don't put a few nickels in the machine.
Flip Wilson,,"Most drag impersonations are a drag. But everyone can like Geraldine. The secret of my success with Geraldine is that she's not a put-down of women. She's smart, she's trustful, she's loyal, she's sassy. Most drag impersonations are a drag. But women can like Geraldine, men can like Geraldine, everyone can like Geraldine."
Flip Wilson,"birthday,teachers,shoes","My happiest memory of childhood was my first birthday in reform school. This teacher took an interest in me. In fact, he gave me the first birthday presents I ever got: a box of Cracker Jacks and a can of ABC shoe polish."
Flip Wilson,,"If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments."
Flip Wilson,attitude,Funny is an attitude.
Flip Wilson,,My show is my statement. What I have to say is on the screen. My life is my own. I don't want to talk about my private self. Why should I?
Flip Wilson,,"Things can be funny only when we are in fun. When we're 'dead earnest,' humor is the only thing that is dead."
Flip Wilson,,What you see is what you get.
Flip Wilson,,"When you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not."
Flip Wilson,,Funny is not a color. Being black is only good from the time you get from the curtain to the microphone.
Flip Wilson,,It's later than it's ever been.
Flip Wilson,,Get well cards have become so humorous that if you don't get sick you're missing half the fun.
Flip Wilson,devil,The devil made me do it.
Flip Wilson,,"Don't order one for the road, because the road is already laid out."
Flip Wilson,,Being your own man does not mean taking advantage of anyone else.
Flip Wilson,,"If I had my entire life to live over, I doubt if I’d have the strength."
Flip Wilson,,"It takes 15,000 nuts to hold a car together, but only one to spread it all over the highway."
Flip Wilson,,"My main point is to be funny; if I can slip a message in there, fine."
Flip Wilson,,"That's a good time to sneak, four in the morning, 'cause anyone you run into, they're sneaking too."
Flip Wilson,,"I was number one in the ratings four times last year and twice this season. What could be more damn equal than that? If they get any more equal, I don't want it."
Flip Wilson,,I think Mr. Wilson will have to be the rest of the way alone.
Flip Wilson,opportunities,It would be ridiculous for me to say anything negative regarding blacks having an equal opportunity on TV.
Frank Caliendo,,"When I used to watch vaudevillian impressionists, people like Rich Little or Frank Gorshin, I always felt like the voice was the only point. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to be of the Robin Williams or Jonathan Winters model, where observation and storytelling was important."
Frank Caliendo,,I didn't apply to different schools. I wasn't really sure what I was going to do.
Frank Caliendo,,I made the grandkids laugh. John Madden finally liked me!
Frank Caliendo,,"If it’s just the voice, then you can only do jokes. It’s not really even about the impression so much. It’s about the take and what you do with the person. I try to get a character across with the impression."
Frank Caliendo,,I love John Madden because he makes me feel smart.
Frank Caliendo,,"You know what I would do? I would remake The Wizard of Oz with Robin Williams, and that's it. Just let him do the whole dang thing by himself."
Frank Caliendo,audience,"It's a simple and an effective way of getting everyone on the same page, prepared and paying attention to the gag. People just get into that frame of mind of you doing impressions. It can take a minute or two for an audience to catch on when you aren't doing one."
Frank Caliendo,,"Hey, I work one full hour a day!"
Frank Caliendo,,"Every time Joe Biden says something goofy, I just picture GWBush at home, watching TV saying: “That guy says some dumb stuff.”"
Frank Caliendo,,"Here's a guy that when he puts his contacts in, he can see better."
Frank Caliendo,,"Remember: Super Bowl is the biggest day of the year for pizza delivery - so no matter what happens in the game, Peyton Manning wins."
Frank Caliendo,,I love President Bush. I think it's great we have a president who always looks like he's looking directly into the sun.
Frank Caliendo,,"Yeah I've been booed before, but I'll be booed again."
Frank Caliendo,,Guy on the plane I'm on has a text alert that sounds like a gunshot... And he isn't putting it on vibrate.
Frank Caliendo,,Everything is awesome... Everything is cool when you're a part of a team...
Frank Caliendo,,"Speaking of Quarterback nicknames, you hear they’re calling Jay Cutler 50 cent? Because you only get two quarters out of him."
Frank Caliendo,,"People expect me to do the classics, and it is a lot like playing a favorite song."
Frank Caliendo,,"Without Brett Favre, they wouldn’t have Brett Favre, and that’s what that’s all about."
Frank Caliendo,,"Kim Kardashian is single again. Hey, great. Maybe that will give the NBA players something to do during the lockout."
Frank Caliendo,,"I was always working, so I would get reading done very late at night a lot of times."
Frank Caliendo,,"I chose Journalism by default. I always loved TV, and I had no idea what else to do, so I studied what interested me."
Frank Caliendo,money,"I don't do these things to be mean, I do them to make money."
Frank Caliendo,,Jay Leno's the only guy on earth who could have a bobble head made of him that would bobble less than his actual head.
Frank Caliendo,,I love synonym. That’s my favorite flavor!
Frank Caliendo,television,"I don’t know if you can tell, but I grew up watching a lot of television."
Frank Caliendo,,"Here’s a guy who when he runs, he goes faster."
Franklyn Ajaye,,"You must study their deliveries, their use of their bodies, their timing, and their use of audio and vocal effects."
Franklyn Ajaye,,Don’t try to give a funny opinion; give your opinion in a way that will be funny.
Franklyn Ajaye,confidence,You must not be afraid of small bits of silence. To use it well is the height of confidence and skill for a comedian. It increases the tension in a good way and adds contrast like a curveball complements the fastball of a good pitcher.
Franklyn Ajaye,,"Walking back and forth also helps by creating the illusion that you are thinking of the routines on the spot, giving your performance a more spontaneous feeling."
Franklyn Ajaye,,"When you take a pause before delivering your punch line, you will be using silence as a creative entity in itself."
Franklyn Ajaye,,"Being a professional comedian is doing it right and good, when you don’t feel like it."
Franklyn Ajaye,,A technique I developed quite naturally to help me make smooth transitions was to use a word or phrase from the next routine in the preceding one.
Franklyn Ajaye,,Originality is never embraced as quickly as the commonplace.
Franklyn Ajaye,,"If I'm crisp and economical in my delivery, have smooth transitions, movement and animation, and flights of fancy, that would get me an A."
Franklyn Ajaye,,"Evaluate every performance on: stage presence, concentration, delivery, material and lessons learned."
Franklyn Ajaye,alcohol,"Black people drink lots of beer. However, you won't see us skiing down a mountain for one, or see us diving for Frisbees on concrete for one."
Franklyn Ajaye,,"This whole urban rap thing needs to be pulled back some. The ghetto is being glorified, and there's nothing good about the ghetto except getting out of one."
Franklyn Ajaye,,Taping yourself and making yourself listen to the tape of each performance no matter how bad is really important.  There's always a nugget line or a direction pointed out to you in even the worst show. 
Franklyn Ajaye,,"I think women seem to handle celibacy better. Well, at least when you talk with them, they're very nonchalant about it: 'Oh, no, no, I haven't made love in about three or four months, and I really haven't missed it at all. I've been doing a lot of horseback riding.'"
Franklyn Ajaye,,"If you do stories, or material with a lot of tags, or afterthought lines, you’ll probably have to cut those out. In other words, you’ll have to strip-mine your material and “lean” it up for time constraints."
Franklyn Ajaye,comedians,"I don't like the fact that most black people or black comedians have to present themselves in a flamboyant way. It's good if you can do that, but I don't like to think that's the way all black comedians are. I'm not that type."
Franklyn Ajaye,,"Being black and speaking properly are not mutually exclusive. My father was an African, and he spoke beautifully at home. Nelson Mandela speaks beautifully. Should Mandela put his hat on backwards and say, 'Yo, homey, this is Nelson. Yo, Winnie, yo, this is def'?"
Franklyn Ajaye,"decisions,audience","Obviously the audience has veto power signified by whether they laugh or not, but you-not them-retain the ultimate power to decide what they’re going to get the opportunity to laugh at."
Franklyn Ajaye,audience,An aspiring comedian must be determined to get to his or her true feelings on a subject and convey that to the audience. Figure out what you’re feeling or interested in because the goal is to get the audience interested in what you’re interested in. Good stand up comedy is drawing people into your head.
Franklyn Ajaye,television,"I wasn’t able to showcase myself to my satisfaction on television until I did one very important thing: I started treating television as though it were just another night at a club. I stopped ruminating continuously over my television set and thinking about its potential significance. This started with my last few shots with Johnny Carson when I realized why my spots hadn’t seemed as funny to me as my club sets. I realized that the extra thought and preparation actually worked against me. Once I adopted this new attitude, I started doing television spots that I was happy with. But let me stress that this was just my approach."
Franklyn Ajaye,desire,"Bombing teaches you how badly you want to become a comedian. Because unless it’s a burning desire, you’ll quit when the consistent bombing becomes too much to take."
Franklyn Ajaye,,I don't think that comedians have a tradition of trashing the next generation.
Franklyn Ajaye,audience,It’s better to play to the host as though in a real conversation and let the audience listen in- which they are.
Franklyn Ajaye,,"Black cats don’t worry about going bald. We know we don’t have a lot of options, so we adapt to it pretty fast. Black cat will look in the mirror and say, “I’m bald… can’t be pulling no hair from over here and combing it over there… so I just shave this shit off.” White dudes they fight baldness to the death. I know a white guy with one hair, got it swirled all over his head."
Franklyn Ajaye,desire,"I have no desire to be hip to the latest black slang and do the stereotypical black thing. I was a Richard Pryor fan, and I have used profanity in my act. But when it becomes a whole thing that defines blacks, we're limiting ourselves. The enemy is us."
Franklyn Ajaye,audience,"You can’t wait forever for an audience to get the joke, but you should give them at least two seconds to join in before you go on to the next one."
Franklyn Ajaye,"experience,audience","Ideally, you want to be in a fifty-fifty power-sharing arrangement with the audience – both of you are there for a mutually enjoyable experience."
Franklyn Ajaye,,"Note the “quality” – not just the quantity – of the laugh that you’re getting. This is just as important – if not more – than just getting laughs. Cheap laughs are just that. Your jokes’ll be treated just like Chinese food. In an hour, people’ll be hungry for another comedian."
Franklyn Ajaye,audience,"In addition to listening to the audience’s laugh, you want to listen to their silence. Is it bored or interested silence? The silence is quieter and filled with energy when they’re interested. You can hear a pin drop. When they’re bored, you can always hear it."
Franklyn Ajaye,golf,Very few blacks will take up golf until the requirement for plaid pants is dropped.
Franklyn Ajaye,audience,I advise treating the studio audience like a nightclub audience because that’s the reason you’re doing television – to get them to come see you in a nightclub.
Franklyn Ajaye,worth,"Moving to Australia was not a career move, but a quality of life issue. It has no guns, no God, and no gangster rap. As an Ethiopian cab driver said to me the other day when I was returning from a gig in Sydney, ""Australia is a peaceful, democratic place."" I like the relatively stress free lifestyle. It's worth the drop in income."
Franklyn Ajaye,audience,"When I've mentioned things that I thought only happened to me, or thoughts that I felt had only had crossed my mind, the audience response indicated that they seemed to have happened to, or been thought of by many people."
Franklyn Ajaye,audience,Doing panel well is actually more important than doing a good stand-up spot because it’s when the audience observes you in a more “conversational” mode and decides if they like your personality – which is one of the real keys to popularity.
Franklyn Ajaye,,"When I saw the sign on the freeway that said, ""Los Angeles 445 miles,"" I said to myself, ""I've got to get out of this lane."""
Franklyn Ajaye,,"On a good night, I'm just into the flow and seeing the pictures and words in my mind clearly before I say them.  On a bad night, which to be honest are nowhere near as bad as when I was starting out, I just concentrate on performing the routines correctly. I focus on my delivery."
Franklyn Ajaye,audience,"Be prepared to cut your little extra lines that come after a big punchline and move on to the next joke or routine to give your set more punch and crispness. You can keep them in your set, but if the audience applauds your big line, don’t do your tag when it dies down, just move on."
Freddie Prinze,,I don't think I'm a part of my mind that's always working - keeping a record of things that might be funny.
Freddie Prinze,,"This family was raised Catholic and I think there are still some members of the family who are practising Catholics, while others are recovering Catholics! That, to me, is a real part of America and we wanted to represent that."
Freddie Prinze,decisions,I must end it. There is no hope. I will be at peace. No one had anything to do with it. My decision totally.
Freddie Prinze,sisters,"I never saw Lenny Bruce, but I know all about him. I heard every tape. I’ve talked with his mother. His daughter is like a sister to me. Can you imagine missing someone you never knew?"
Freddie Prinze,new york,"I grew up in New York in a neighbourhood called Washington Heights. It's not really a ghetto, it's a ghetto suburb. Slums with trees. Even the birds are junkies. The birds don't know how to fly, they just fall out of trees and bother people. ""Tweet, tweet sucker. Give me a quarter."""
Freddie Prinze,driving,"L.A. I love it. Everybody’s a superstar. A guy will tell you, ""Yeah, I’m a producer."" And he’s driving a cab."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"As far as guys who perform onstage, I love Chris Rock. I'm kind of jaded on everyone else."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"""You've gotten fat!"" ""Well you're fat too!"" ""I know I'm fat! I was fat in high school! I kept my figure, why couldn't you?"""
Gabriel Iglesias,alcohol,Some people can handle alcohol. You know who you are. Some people can't handle alcohol. The police know who you are.
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Comedians do movies and TV so that when they tour, they sell out. That's the goal: To get popular enough so the place is packed."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"You gotta live life before you can talk about it. Sometimes when things don't work out in life, they work out on stage."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"What’s the “I” stand for, “I need a bigger bed”?"
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I don't have to worry about writing jokes. I just tell stories about things that have happened to me. As long as I'm alive and I'm living and I'm experiencing different things every day, the show will always change."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I just know you can not be on top forever. There's always going to be the next guy, and if I'm going to go down, I'd like to know I helped the next guy take my spot. You can't prevent the inevitable, but you can join the ship."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I know what it's like to have a family and not have insurance and really need it. As a comic, insurance was one of those sacrifices I made early on until I could afford it."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Just as I was about to get into my donuts, the cop gets to the window and says the same thing that they all say, right, ""Do you know why I stopped you?"" It was too easy. I looked at him and I said, ""'Cause you can smell it."""
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Life is measured by how you lived it, not by the years."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I usually travel with a posse. I roll deep. I travel like a rapper, but without the artillery. We don't carry guns, we carry cookies."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I'm always very happy to talk to people. I relate to people, and the guy on stage is very much the guy that's off stage. People know when it's fake."
Gabriel Iglesias,,I got off the plane - I was walking and cooking at the same time.

Gabriel Iglesias,,"The Ford Flex is a really, really cool car. You get inside and you have so much headroom and it's really comfortable to drive and it's real techy inside. You look at the screen and it's blue and you've got all kinds of controls. Everything is digital."
Gabriel Iglesias,problems,"I'm all about showing people that I'm a little messed up, I have a lot of the same problems you have. By exposing myself and putting myself out there, people can relate to me and my act won't grow stale. I mean, nobody wants to hear a comedian say, 'Life is great.'"
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Believe it or not, I've got a really bad metabolism. One burger and I'm done. I'm not a guy that puts away 10 burgers."
Gabriel Iglesias,,I’m not fat. It’s just my awesomeness swelling up inside of me.
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I almost bought a DeLorean the other day just because. If I see something that I think is cool and I like it, I'll go for it."
Gabriel Iglesias,,I never go perform somewhere alone. I've done that since day one. I've always taken other comics with me.
Gabriel Iglesias,mexicans,You know what I learned about Hawaiians? They're just blown up Mexicans!
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I'm not on a diet. And it’s funny cause people go ‘Well, then why do you drink diet soda?’ So I can eat regular cake."
Gabriel Iglesias,girlfriends,"And then I realized I was being checked out by guys! And I know they were checking me out, because they were looking at me like I look at tacos. And I thought to myself, ""Oh my god, I can turn on a man! Shoot!"" And I called my girlfriend, and I said, ""Baby, you better not mess this up; I have options!"""
Gabriel Iglesias,,A lot of the comedians nowadays just do comedy as a stepping stone. Take for example Dane Cook. The guy is huge. The main reason he got into it is to do what he is doing now: film and television work.
Gabriel Iglesias,,It's late and I can't sleep. Bowling it is.
Gabriel Iglesias,police,"My favorite people to have fun with are police officers 'cause they're so serious, you know."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"For the level of entertainment you get for the ticket, it's a solid show."
Gabriel Iglesias,politics,"I don't get controversial, I don't get political and I don't tell you what to do with your life. I just go out there and tell some stories, and people can relate."
Gabriel Iglesias,worth,"Connecting with people is not hard. I love the interaction and the feedback after shows. It does take some time, but the fans appreciate it which makes it worth it."
Gabriel Iglesias,,You wonder why I only talk about my personal life. But that's all I've ever done.
Gabriel Iglesias,,"When you leave, you basically want to go eat, because I talk a lot about food in my act. So when you leave, you leave hungry."
Gabriel Iglesias,,I was not the popular kid in school.
Gabriel Iglesias,,I want to get so famous that I don't have to wake up in the morning. It'll probably never happen.

Gabriel Iglesias,,"There’s 5 levels of fatness! Fluffy is one of the levels. There’s big, healthy, husky, fluffy and damn."
Gabriel Iglesias,"sisters,hollywood","I got a brother who calls me Hollywood. Sisters kind of keep their distance. Even my mom is kind of like ahhh with me. Yeah dude, it really sucks. And I wish things were different. Unfortunately, they don't understand everything I go through on a day to day basis to be able to maintain what I'm doing."
Gabriel Iglesias,dancing,"When I go to dance clubs, I always dance with big girls, so we finish at the same time."
Gabriel Iglesias,differences,"I'm a comedian who happens to be Latino. What's the difference? The difference is, my special will air on Comedy Central, not Telemundo."
Gabriel Iglesias,"hate,racism",Me racist? The only race I hate is the one you have to run.
Gabriel Iglesias,,"In the beginning, when I was doing my shows, I was incorporating a lot of Spanish, just trying to be a Latino comic instead of just a comic. Now I try to make the show as broad as possible... I don't want to alienate people. I want to make it so everybody can follow along and everybody can relate."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Every night, it’s a bakery on the bus. It’s a curse, because I talk about how much I love cake, people bring me cake. And now I just found out I’m diabetic, so I’m like, are you kidding me?!"
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I keep it very family-friendly. Every now and then I’ll slip a little bit, but that’s just the way I perform."
Gabriel Iglesias,family,We can choose our family. We can’t choose our relatives.
Gabriel Iglesias,death,I don't wanna die tomorrow knowing that I could have had a piece of chocolate cake tonight.
Gabriel Iglesias,"life,people",Why do people measure life by the years instead of how good the years were?
Gabriel Iglesias,,"You know, a lot of people think that just cause you work out, lift weights, eat right, and do what people tell you to do that you'll live a long live, maybe you will; but, why do people measure life by the years instead about how good the years were."
Gabriel Iglesias,,Put your life out there and make it entertaining.
Gabriel Iglesias,girlfriends,"And I don’t want you thinking that my girlfriend is a bad person. She is an amazing woman, the fact that I only have seven stories about her in eight years, says a lot. You know, don’t get me wrong, five of them happened this year, but that’s still way below the bar, you know what I am saying."
Gabriel Iglesias,"arguments,disney","When you have nothing but big friends, you never get into arguments - except one. And that is, who is the biggest? I'll let you know right now, there's only one way to settle this. We all get in a bus and we go to Disney and we get on a roller coaster - whoever gets the least amount of clicks on the safety bar is the big one."
Gabriel Iglesias,rain,Home in bed listening to the rain getting ready to order a pizza. Sounds like a song til the last part.

Gabriel Iglesias,,"You live by the cake, you die by the cake."
Gabriel Iglesias,,The worst thing I’m going to do is have dinner without you.
Gabriel Iglesias,football,I know enough football to know that’s funny!
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Wearing a Hawaiian shirt, you don’t ever come across as offensive. Nobody sees you as a threat. You see someone in a Hawaiian shirt, and you are like ‘this guy is ready to party.’ "
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Wearing a Hawaiian shirt, you don’t ever come across as offensive. Nobody sees you as a threat. You see someone in a Hawaiian shirt, and you are like ‘this guy is ready to party.’ "
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Walgreens, Rite Aid, CVS and Wal-Mart have all figured out the evolution of life and they grabbed all the products that are necessary for a life. And they stuck them in one aisle and they put them in order according to how you mess up... First thing you're going to see: condoms. Next to that: lubricant. Next to that: pregnancy test. Next to that: Pampers. Next to that: formula. And at the end of the aisle they sell beer."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Now I understand why people do drugs, why people drink, and why people go crazy. As the success level goes up and up and up, the further detached I get from everybody else. Luckily, with my girlfriend, everything is gravy because I brought her into it. I brought her in and she's very hands on with my career."
Gabriel Iglesias,"religion,sport,politics","I learned early on, stay away from politics, stay away from religion and don't talk about sports. Those three right there will get you in trouble."
Gabriel Iglesias,,You can't be bad ass in a car that kills gas like I kill tacos.
Gabriel Iglesias,honesty,"Kids, man, they’re way too honest. They’re like mini-alcoholics."
Gabriel Iglesias,,When I was a kid I did impressions and funny voices a lot. When I was telling a story I would use the voices to make it more entertaining.
Gabriel Iglesias,dinosaurs,"And he was offended at my show. Not by anything that I said, but because of the fact that now at the shows I started selling T-shirts and apparently, I didn't have his size. Keep in mind, I go all the way up to five X on the T-shirts and he was like, ""You don't have my size."" I was like, ""Dude, I didn't know they made you! I have up to five X, I don't have X!"" A picture of a dinosaur on the back of the tag, you know?"
Gabriel Iglesias,wrestling,"I get a lot of influence from pro wrestling. People are like, 'Oh, it's fake.' But it's not about whether the guy wins or loses, it's about how he entertains you the whole time you're watching."
Gabriel Iglesias,football,My nosey neighbor called the cops on me for making too much noise during football. Is fluffy gonna have to open up a can whop ass?
Gabriel Iglesias,,"The only way I will do a sitcom is if it’s hurled at me, and I don’t have to work for it."
Gabriel Iglesias,differences,"I used to say that there were Five Levels of Fatness. Reason why I say ""Used to say"" is because now there are six! Uh-huh, I met the new one in Las Crucas. The original five levels are Big, Healthy, Husky, Fluffy, and Damn! People ask, ""What could be bigger than damn!"" The new level's called ""Oh hell no!"" What's the difference? You're still willing to work with level five. Example, if you're on an elevator and you're with your friend and this really big guy gets on and you and your friend look at each other and you're like, ""damn!"" But you still let the big guy ride your elevator. That's the difference. Level six, you see walking towards your elevator, ""Oh hell no! No! No!"" That's the difference."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I started riding the whole 'fluffy' train, and it's a cute word and socially a lot more acceptable than someone saying is fat or obese. If you call a girl 'fat,' yo, she'll raise hell, but if you say, 'Aw girl, look at you, you're fluffy,' there's almost a sexy appeal to it."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Some comics don't like it when people talk during the set, and it does get a little bit annoying after awhile, but I basically let people dictate what jokes I'm going to do."
Gabriel Iglesias,,I see a Latino comic as someone who can only perform for Latino audiences. I cross the board.
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I’m always ready for TV. I don’t have to edit my jokes - when you work clean, you can work anywhere."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I'll walk up to a woman, I'll say the first thing that comes to mind: 'Hey, you hungry?'"
Gabriel Iglesias,,"That's one thing about my shows. I tell people, I'm not a comedian, I'm just a really funny reporter. I put my life out there and make it entertaining. By putting it out there, it helps me to deal with it, you know, so I don't snap and so I don't go off the handle when I get home."
Gabriel Iglesias,,I had to travel half way across the world to be called an American.
Gabriel Iglesias,,I don't even have a clue as to where to find a pregnancy test. I'm looking at all the aisles... they don't have one that says 'oops.'
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Honestly, you got to take care of the people that take care of you. I know that sounds like cliche, or borderline phony, but that's the case. The reason I've had the fans that I have is because I've been consistent over the years and kept coming back and doing the same runs. I'm never going to stop doing the cities I've gone through. I'm only going to add."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"When I first got to St. Louis, I saw the arch and I said, ‘I want to go to that McDonalds.'"
Gabriel Iglesias,,"I have always been told that I was a funny, entertaining person and have always been told to give comedy a try."
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Hanging out with comics, all they did was make fun of me."
Gabriel Iglesias,,Comedy is my passion. I'm going to do this until I drop.
Gabriel Iglesias,,"Being on TV sucks. It's a lot of work. You memorize scripts and then you show up and they change everything. I'm a control freak. When I'm doing stand-up, I say what I want and then I get instant feedback."
Gabriel Iglesias,,Got an offer to do my next special in 3D. Sounds cool but do you really want me coming into your house?
Gabriel Iglesias,dancing,"I'm a big boy, but I can get jiggy with it. Ladies, I will go to dance clubs, and I will tear it up hardcore for a good 30 seconds."
Gabriel Iglesias,holidays,For this being the holiday season everyone at the mall is pissed. Time to shop online.
Gabriel Iglesias,"school,common sense","With all the classes they offer at school, how come they don’t have one for common sense?"
Gallagher,babies,I found out why God made babies cute. It's so you don't kill them.
Gallagher,,"See, it's frivolous, superfluous products in America. Like scented toilet paper... is the dumbest thing in the world! The only thing you don't have to make smell good cause it's gonna get fucked up. Who is that smell there to impress? My thumb? If you want to impress my thumb, make it thicker in the middle."
Gallagher,,"'I before E except after C?' Americans don't want to learn that! They just sort of make an 'I' looking 'E' and an 'E' looking 'I' then put the dot, right there in the middle!"
Gallagher,,"If your knees bent the other way, what would a chair look like?"
Gallagher,,"If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?"
Gallagher,teachers,"We go to school to learn to communicate, but all the teachers say to us is ""shut up!"""
Gallagher,,"If pro is the opposite of con, is progress the opposite of congress?"
Gallagher,,Why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together?
Gallagher,,Why do they call it a TV set when you only get one?
Gallagher,,"Frankie Valli sings 'Walk Like A Man, Talk Like A Man'... sings it like a woman!"
Gallagher,,"You listen to the world, you'll hear McDonald's say that eatin' there is like a symphony of taste. Yeah, my butt's the wind instrument and the fart's the whole note."
Gallagher,,"People like crowds. The bigger the crowd, the more people show up. Small crowd, hardly anybody shows up."
Gallagher,,Women wear a pair of panties but only one bra.
Gallagher,,"When yogurt goes bad, how can you tell?"
Gallagher,"babies,coffee","Well, see, babies are born with new eyes. They look at the world with new eyes and you begin to see things, too, through their eyes. I had a problem with her with toilet trainin' and I don't blame her a bit. Cause first I showed her you can't hit your cup on the coffee table. Then I showed her you can't eat on the couch. Then here was this chair you could shit in."
Gallagher,,Sledge-O-Matic removes unwanted fingerprints from walls. Sledge-O-Matic also removes unwanted walls from fingerprints.
Gallagher,,Why do they call that funny little statue a bust when it stops right before the part of the body that it's named after?
Gallagher,,Why isn't phonetic spelled the way it sounds?
Gallagher,,"Why do they call 'em 'buildings' when they're done building 'em? They ought to be called 'builts.' Or, 'crumblings.' 'I live in that crumbling over there.'"
Gallagher,,What is dumber than a blind person with a gun? The idiot who handed them the gun. Where do you hide from a blind person with a gun? How do you make a noise that ain't like a rabbit?
Gallagher,,"What can you say in America? Can I say Priscilla Presley has a big butt? Will I have to prove it in a court of law? Hey, Priscilla, you wanna back it on in here, huh? If she can fit in the witness chair we'll drop, Your Honor."
Gallagher,,Why is bra singular and panties plural?
Gallagher,"divorce,teachers",Why are all the home-ec teachers divorced?
Gallagher,,"Wonder why it is your underarms stink. Did it ever come in handy? Did you ever say ""Well thank God my underarms stunk! He came out of the bushes and I said Get back! I've been to aerobics!"""
Gallagher,,What makes Teflon stick to the pan?
Gallagher,animals,"Y'know, God experimented with the other animals before he got around to us. You ladies oughtta thank him for creating the cow, and getting that udder idea out of his head!"
Gallagher,,"Do you need a pain reliever that works? Picky shits, ain't ya?"
Gallagher,,This I before E stuff would've screwed up Einstein. He's got it wrong twice in his name.
Gallagher,,Remember this advice... Never let your mom comb your hair when she's mad at your dad!
Gallagher,smoking,Why are cigarettes sold at gas stations when smoking is prohibited there?
Gallagher,business,Our alphabet is based on some kind of a bookkeeper's code to keep the Jews' and the Egyptians' noses out of the Phoenician cattle business!
Gallagher,future,"I saw a can said Pepsi Free and I said ""That means it don't have Pepsi in it. That's a Coke."" Hog futures; I heard that. Hogs don't have no future. Bacon is not a career."
Gallagher,california,"Living in California is like living in a bowl of granola; what ain't fruits or nuts, is flakes."
Gallagher,,"If 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the doors?"
Gallagher,driving,Why do you need a driver's license to buy liquor when you're not supposed to drink and drive?
Gallagher,christmas,Wonder why it is God didn't give us wheels. He must've known we get skates for Christmas.
Gallagher,stupidity,"You know what's stupid? Skiing. You get on top of a slippery mountain with sleds on your feet and you go down... big deal. Try not to. Or, go up! Now that'd be a sport for ya!"
Gallagher,airports,"I've come here tonight to San Jose, the only city in this nation smart enough to put its airport downtown where nobody cares."

Gallagher,,I know what people laugh at. I know their vocabulary.
Gallagher,parents,Parents are trying to be friends with their kids rather than draw the line and tell them what proper public behavior would be.

Gallagher,,"I wanna say something about my baby, Aimee. The IRS says I have to; I pay her $20,000 as a writer."
Gallagher,intelligence,"I wish there was a knob on the TV so you could turn up the intelligence. They got one marked ""brightness"" but it don't work, does it?"
Gallagher,,"So they bother you with it, they bother you with it, they bother you with it. Finally you say, ""Gimme the damn present."" You open it up and it's dumb. Lucky for you, now you got a couple days, take it back to the store, get something else, so when your mother comes over she don't see you're still married to an idiot!"
Gallagher,,"I want you to remember, behind every successful man is an amazed mother-in-law."
Gallagher,,"Wouldn't it be great if people were the same in bed as they are in every day life? When Mark Spitz gets done, does he do a flip off the headboard and come back for another lap? 'Gee, Nadia, that was perfect! That full twisting dismount wasn't bad either, babe!'"
Gallagher,"honesty,business","I would like now to talk about the Japanese, a race of very short people who are always bending in half. You can't make an honest business deal with them because you can't look em' in the eye. I don't believe any group of people should be able to build a car they can't pronounce. I'm talking of course about the 'Cororra'."
Gallagher,,"Why do they put the little ""on/off"" words on a light switch? If the light's on, you can see that it's on. If the light's off, it's too dark to see the words on the switch."
Gallagher,,"Well, let me welcome myself to Texas. Where a man comes home and hangs his hat on his lap."
Gallagher,,"Hey, what do you expect from a culture that drives on parkways and parks on driveways?"

Gallagher,,Why are there interstates in Hawaii?
Gallagher,,You know that little indestructible black box that is used on planes... why can't they make the whole plane out of the same material?
Gallagher,,Why do they call them cowboys? Cows is girls; bulls is boys. They should call them 'cowgirls' and 'bullboys.'
Gallagher,,"I know you people, you're the smart ones. You're not the ones going down the freeway with a seatbelt hanging out the door makin' sparks. You're not the ones goin' over the overpass with the turn signal on. Where are they gonna turn? You almost wish they would."
Gallagher,,"If M & M's melt in your mouth, not in your hand, what would they do, say... under your arms?"
Gallagher,driving,"I have so much to say when I'm driving and I only have a horn. A horn don't say enough. A horn just goes, ""screeeeeeeew yooooooou!"" Right? I want a microphone. A microphone with a speaker on top, like the cops got. You can have 'em, too. Freedom of speech includes volume."
Gallagher,,"I have spent my life paying attention to my art form, developing my art form, worrying about my show and what I'm bringing to people, making sure that I give them a fine trade."
Gallagher,tea,"Iced tea in the wintertime! Why not? 'Cause it's fucking dumb, that's why not!"
Gallagher,,"Why do Cowboys wear a spur on each boot? If one side of the horse moves, the other side goes with it."

Gallagher,,Why are there flotation devices under plane seats instead of parachutes?
Garry Shandling,,"I think I look great in green, and I'm going to start wearing more green."
Garry Shandling,,"I think sometimes I should do more carousing, because I don't do much and maybe it would be fun occasionally. It's hard for me to have fun and I'm a serious thinker and a searcher and funny from the front."
Garry Shandling,,"I don't know why men are so fascinated with television and I think it has something to do with - if I may judge from my own father, who used to sit and stare at the TV while my mother was speaking to him - I think that's a man's way of tuning out."
Garry Shandling,,My first appearance as a guest on The Tonight Show was in '81.
Garry Shandling,babies,"Yes, I'm a nice man and I enjoy babies. I'm a sensitive guy. I held a baby the other day and it was the first time either of us cried."
Garry Shandling,,"Which is, I'm an optimist that two people can be together to work out their conflicts. And that commitment, I think, might be what love is, because they both grow from their relationship."
Garry Shandling,dating,I have such poor vision I can date anybody.
Garry Shandling,dating,"I'm dating a woman now who, evidently, is unaware of it."
Garry Shandling,,"When I'm not in a relationship, I shave one leg, so when I sleep, it feels like I'm with a woman."
Garry Shandling,friends,My friends tell me I have an intimacy problem. But they don't really know me.
Garry Shandling,,"After making love I said to my girl, ""Was it good for you too?"" And she said, I don't think this was good for anybody."
Garry Shandling,,"Because I am afraid of commitment. This movie certainly has some bearing and is some reflection of my real feeling about relationships, because I do have commitment issues. My friends tell me I have intimacy problems, but they don't know me, so who cares what they think?"
Garry Shandling,,I'm very loyal in relationships. Even when I go out with my mom I don't look at other moms.
Garry Shandling,,I like going into nature and that's where I'm happiest.
Garry Shandling,"emotions,business","I think it's one of the main negative emotional ingredients that fuels show business, because there's so much at stake and the fear of failure looms large."
Garry Shandling,,"But I really like hosting, I think it's a strength of mine. It allows me to improvise, and I love the spontaneity of that, and I think I'm funny behind the desk when interviewing someone."
Garry Shandling,television,"I don't like this reality television, I have to be honest, ... I think real people should not be on television. It's for special people like us, people who have trained and studied to appear to be real."
Garry Shandling,,"You know it's funny that none of the regular late-night shows now use guest hosts the way Johnny did. No one talks about it much, but it's curious that they don't do it. They would each have to be asked the reason why they don't."
Garry Shandling,,The only way I would go back to hosting would be if it were something entirely new. It would prevent me from wanting to host a standard-fare kind of talk show.
Garry Shandling,"homeless,dating",I'm dating a homeless woman. It was easier talking her into staying over.
Garry Shandling,,"I've never had anyone put on a puppet show to convince me of anything. And I've done a lot of stuff. I don't know that I would put the puppets on when I was pitching a show. This was the head of the studio putting a puppet show on. And I'll tell you, he wasn't bad."
Garry Shandling,,"First of all, I'm not the kind of guy that likes to rehash the show and so forth and so on."
Garry Shandling,,"Here's the thing - I'm single, I haven't been married, I don't have kids yet. If I do have kids I would be interested to see them in my life, so here's a movie for kids and I'm in there and I'm supposed to be kind of funny for kids."
Garry Shandling,,I am pretty tenacious as a perfectionist in terms of getting something right.
Garry Shandling,,I don't know how to ground myself without the other actor present.
Garry Shandling,,"I guess he wanted to see a little more sexual activity because in real life, in bed I think less is more and let the woman come to me. Frankly, I don't even need a woman there."
Garry Shandling,,"I once made love for an hour and fifteen minutes, but it was the night the clocks are set ahead."
Garry Shandling,,What planet are you from?
Garry Shandling,,Without comedy as a defence mechanism I wouldn't be able to survive.
Garry Shandling,,"I'm good in bed, actually, and I think I could learn to be a good communicator, too. The only trouble with that is it leads to marriage."
Garry Shandling,,Rip as we know is vastly experienced and funnier than I think anyone knew. The show really reveals him to be a brilliant comedic actor.
Garry Shandling,,It's not the hair on your head that matters. It's the kind of hair you have inside.
Garry Shandling,,I'm not a party guy. I don't carouse very much.
Garry Shandling,,"I actually think I'm more of a turtle than Verne is. Where Verne is up on two legs and moving at full speed and doesn't pull his head into the shell very often, I in reality was five or ten minutes later to every recording session."
Garry Shandling,dating,Women need to know that not all guys are going to hurt them the way that the guy did before they started dating me. I know guys I wouldn't go out with.

Garry Shandling,,I don't know how to ground myself without the other actor present.
Garry Shandling,,I practice safe sex - I use an airbag.
Garry Shandling,,"The comic strip is what I looked at, and it's another reason I did it. The comic strip, where animals would comment on human behaviour, interested me."
Garry Shandling,,"I told my girl friend that unless she expressed her feelings and told me what she liked I wouldn't be able to please her, so she said, ""Get off me."""
Garry Shandling,,I'm too shy to express my sexual needs except over the phone to people I don't know.
Gary Gulman,,"I really think I'm at the top of my game right now, and I have the tools that I've learned over the years, so I feel really good about what I'm doing onstage now."
Gary Gulman,comedians,"I think of a lot of comedy being watched alone, for some reason. It’s surprising to me that people are getting together to watch stand-up comedy."
Gary Gulman,halloween,No matter what time of year it's always funny when a person walks by me dressed in religious garb and I say Happy Halloween!
Gary Gulman,,"I have 236 movies on my queue and I feel like I should always be watching movies. Like if I wake up in the middle of the night and don't fall directly back to sleep, I'm like, 'I've been up for an hour and a half I could have watched 'Toy Story 3' by now.' In this economy it is a sin not to be watching movies when you have Netflix."
Gary Gulman,,"I was born when my dad was 50… It’s weird growing up with a dad that much older than you. We’d go to the movies, we’re both getting discounts."
Gary Gulman,,"Some people hate Jews. Fine, alright it's been done. I mean, that's part of my problem with it. Could you hate somebody new? I'm not giving you any suggestions but the Belgians have had a good run."
Gary Gulman,"talent,coffee",The key is to get it all down on paper before the coffee stops telling you you’re talented.
Gary Gulman,tea,I sometimes throw in a couple of swears just to keep the Christian right off my tail. I wouldn’t want to be the tea party’s go-to comedian.
Gary Gulman,, I do jokes about the specific guys in the steroids scandal. I feel bad for the guys who did steroids and still suck.
Gary Gulman,,"I always wanted to make strangers and friends and family laugh. I was over ten years younger than my brothers. It was hard to get attention without some kind of gimmick, like athletic stardom or being funny."
Gary Gulman,,"The pill, now that's a good invention, just for the fact that everybody here knows exactly which pill I'm talking about. I gave you ""the"" and a very vague noun and everybody's onboard!"
Gary Gulman,,Is the word brunette used anywhere outside of porn anymore?
Gary Gulman,,"It was early on when I was really focused and obsessed with doing The Tonight Show and Letterman and stuff like that. Then, I quickly realized that those things don’t make or break a career."

Gary Gulman,,A cookie without sugar is a cracker.

If you’re talking about how the side effects of drugs that they advertise on TV are worse than the actual illness they’re supposed to prevent, that’s like the hackiest joke out there now. If you’re still doing that joke, that usually is an indicator of being mainstream, in a bad way."
Gary Gulman,driving,Ever drive by one of those things on the highway which tells you how fast you’re going? I don’t even pay attention to them anymore because I found a similar gadget in my dashboard… Some people slow down at those things… I don’t slow down. I speed up and set the high score.

George Lopez,,"It means a lot in that I always felt invisible, and I was louder in my own head than I was verbally. I was torturing myself, wanting to say things and not knowing how to be. The stand-up was a way out but it never came easy. So to have something that's named after me make it, and that has history tied to Desi and Freddie and now Freddie Jr., it's unbelievable to me because I never really thought anything good would happen to me."
George Lopez,,"Finally there is someone that you can invest in that looks like you, speaks like you, relates to things you relate to, and make our culture okay to talk about."

George Lopez,mexicans,"Mitt Romney wants the Latino vote. He ain't going to get it. He ain't going to get it. And you know why? Because Mitt Romney is a fucking Latino and he won't admit it.

George Lopez,"honesty,desire,motivation","I used to be ashamed by the way that I grew up. I tried to lie my way through better times, but when you think that honesty and truth is really your best weapon you embrace it and put it behind you. In the end, it drives you and motivates you to do good work. No one should be ashamed about where they come from as long as you desire to be a compassionate and decent person."
George Lopez,audience,"We have 93 million households, and we’re in a beautiful position at 11 o’clock. There’s an audience out there that’s underserved. In the continuing diversity of the country, and as people become more familiar with you, you realize it’s not your father’s country anymore."
George Lopez,,"I think it's easier for African American and white comics to be praised than it is Latinos because they think our culture or our humor is substandard. I mean, I just don't think they want to give us credit. I just don't think that they see us as important enough to be at their level. I'm the longest-produced comedy at Warner Bros. and I don't feel special. They come over and say hello. But everybody's gonna make a lot of money and I don't feel like I'm special to them."
George Lopez,,"Life is moments going by, but if you don't grab them, they're gone. For a long time, the only moments that were available were bad ones. So now I make sure to grab the good ones."
George Lopez,,"When you go to cable, there are no stations and no affiliates and they allow you to do your show."
George Lopez,,"I've gotten to a place where I am comfortable and I don't battle myself. I'm further ahead than I ever thought I'd be. I've exceeded everyone's expectations. Including, I think, my own."
George Lopez,audience,"I've spent days in cinemas answering questions from the audience, in interviews, travelling abroad, and all they do is thank me nicely."
George Lopez,mexicans,"Mexican people never say they’re sorry. My grandmother, when I was young, hit me with her car. I was in the driveway–pang! “You know where I park, cabron. Mira, where the oil is.” Did she say she was sorry? “Ta loco, he’s seven. When he starts paying the bills, then I’ll say sorry.”"
George Lopez,,"I had a very difficult childhood. I was surrounded by people who had both parents, which made me feel different. Having a bit of a rougher existence early on, it made me appreciate the work ethic that my grandparents instilled in me."
George Lopez,,"If laughter is the best medicine, I promise to continue to make you laugh as my wife and I work together with the National Kidney Foundation to save lives."
George Lopez,,"I'd shake his hand, but I think that's what's holding up his pants."
George Lopez,,"As long as you are a tax deduction, you will always be safe in my house."
George Lopez,"homeless,addiction","People who are homeless, they're not all addicts. A lot of times, they're just people who, through something like losing their job or losing someone in their life, ended up on the streets. So much of our time is spent in cars that sometimes you need to look out of those windows. And you see that a dollar, 50 cents, whatever you have, may not mean much to you, but it means everything to people who are hungry and who are in need."
George Lopez,,"Just ’cause you can’t control yours, don’t throw us all out!"
George Lopez,smoking,"It's good to see people not smoking. You get dressed up, and you smoke, and it gets in your clothes. You go, ‘What should I wear tonight?’ ‘I don't know, honey, how about something menthol?’"
George Lopez,market,Presents? We already bought you a lot of things. Member when we were at the market and I bought you gum? You'member.
George Lopez,,I have little compassion for people in trailer parks who refuse to move after getting tornado warnings. How hard is it for them to relocate? Their house have wheels.
George Lopez,,"It was June 4, 1979, the first time I went on stage. I didn't know I could do it but I knew I couldn't not do it. I quit everything in my life and this was the one thing I couldn't quit."
George Lopez,toasters,"Tasers don’t work on us. When you grow up poor, you get shocked by shit every single day. Toasters, lamps..."
George Lopez,,"The average late-night viewer is in their mid-50s and the average viewer of TBS is in their 30s and is largely African-American and Hispanic, already, before I even get there."
George Lopez,,"One day, there will be a Latino president.  It could be the mayor of San Antonio. And when he’s all crudo, he can send his brother out there."
George Lopez,,"At the factory, I deal with ex-cons, substance abusers, and sexual harassers. And I'm not just talking about my mom."
George Lopez,,This is L.A. You wanna learn Spanish? Take the bus.
George Lopez,mexicans,"There's no one I admire more than Lee. To be Mexican-American at a time when our culture was really invisible, and to slay the best golfers in the world with a homemade, 'freehand' swing, which is such a Mexican thing, and for me to see that with the big eyes of a kid, as a lot of young kids connect success to Tiger, I connect my success to Lee. It turned out we both grew up knowing what it's like to be alone, we both learned how to mask some of that by being funny, and now to know him and love him, and have him love me more than anyone from my own upbringing, to have him call me 'My boy,' man, that's it."
George Lopez,,"I don`t know what to do about Max, Angie! Last yeah he was up waiting for Santa, and this year him and his little friends on the roof jacking his sleigh! God knows what Carmen will do with the elfs..."
George Lopez,,We didn’t have a ‘baby-proof’ house. Sometimes a 2-year-old with a hammer woke your ass up from a nap!
George Lopez,,It's an honor to walk in the footsteps of a legend. As host I intend to honor the tradition of The Bob Hope Classic and have a great time blazing a new path.
George Lopez,mexicans,Imagine going in knowing that no Mexican American before you had ever succeeded in a lead role.
George Lopez,,I never get to do nothin' in this house!
George Lopez,,"The first night was awful because I was so afraid, and I was never more afraid because it was going out of my character to be outgoing and to be vulnerable and to be out there and onstage. My hands were sweaty and I couldn't swallow, and I drank a bottle of wine to calm my nerves."
George Lopez,,I've gotten in trouble with every race you can imagine.
George Lopez,,I wanted my character to be accessible and nonthreatening.
George Lopez,,"Memories, priceless. Well not really priceless, but there you go!"
George Lopez,,"If you make waffles, throw out the first one."
George Lopez,,"When I look at the Gospel, I see how it is speaking to me at this time. I see how to be to others and it helps."
George Lopez,,I never realized I could love people as much as I do now.
George Lopez,,"I didn't want to be nobody, and that was the only way I could be somebody was to do stand-up."
George Lopez,golf,"My wife gave me a book before we got married, Oh, the Places You'll Go!, by Dr. Seuss. She was trying to tell me something, about what I was capable of, but I didn't get it. Over time, I've sort of lived the message in that book, and I couldn't have without what golf taught me. So I put it in my bag while I played the Old Course, and on the last hole when I posed on the Swilcan Bridge, I held it up."
George Lopez,hollywood,"I am going to bring a more eclectic group of actors and a more eclectic group of musicians from Mana to Santana to Slash and Garth Brooks. I know some pretty high-profile people in Hollywood, in music and in comedy. They all seem to be supportive of the idea."
George Lopez,obama,Obama is the closest thing to a Latino that we have. Barack. Everybody wants to see his birth certificate too.
George Lopez,,Life is too short to not have an orgasm every day.
George Lopez,,"So I started to relax and would work on my act eight hours a day, sitting at a desk writing at my grandmother's house, and I would put on Richard Pryor Live on Long Beach and would play it like a loop and think and write."
George Lopez,,"What they have at Chuckie Cheese that we dont have at our house, you wanna see a mouse... stand there... pull the refrigerator out the wall."
George Wallace,,What lazy SOB invented the Clapper? What do I have to invent so I don’t have to get off my lazy butt and go over and flip that light switch. My father had a Clapper 30 years ago - me.
George Wallace,complaints,"Like this girl said, after she caught me using her tooth brush. I said Why are you complaining? 30 mins ago you were licking my ass."
George Wallace,coffee,As the fly said while landing on the mirrored coffee table. Well... That's another way of looking at it.
George Wallace,complaints,Why does the Air Force need expensive new bombers? Have the people we've been bombing over the years been complaining?
George Wallace,,"Who ever heard of flight 5050? It's always flight 102, flight 216. 5050? They're telling you before you leave the gate - 50/50. Now go out there on runway 13 and give it your best shot."
George Wallace,,"My mother could say some stupid things. I do something wrong, she'd say things that didn't even make sense. ""You go to your room and you stay there until you know how to act."" I'm in my room for three hours. ""To be or not to be, that is the question."""
George Wallace,"babies,politics",People don't let politicians kiss your babies. Those lips have been on lobbyist asses for years now.

George Wallace,,I swear some days I think I owe my toilet an apology.
George Wallace,chicago,Freaks everywhere. I went to a church in Chicago. Church had six Commandments and four do-the-best-you-cans.
George Wallace,,"I was walking around Taiwan and bought some flip flops for my feet. I said I wonder where were these made. Looked under the bottom. It said, ""just around the corner."""
George Wallace,bible,Why is there a Bible in the Courtroom? Isn't that why we're here in the first place? Somebody is lying.
George Wallace,"girlfriends,doctors","My girlfriend likes to play doctor, so I make her say ""Ahhhh"" then charge her $700."
Gilbert Gottfried,,"At the Last Supper how come no one sat on the other side of the table? See, I think originally there were people sitting on the other side but those were the people going, ""You know, the air conditioning hits me right on the back on the neck."""

Gilbert Gottfried,,"Sometimes I'd sit and talk to Nostradamus and he'd just sit there go, ""I know. I know."" Once I went to movies with Nostradamus. I said, ""Boy, what did you think of that ending?"" He goes, ""What? You didn’t see that coming?"""
Gilbert Gottfried,,I predict one of these two teams will win the Super Bowl.
Gilbert Gottfried,,I've never been one of those who wanted to fill my calendar up 90 percent of the time.
Gilbert Gottfried,,"I always felt bad for Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa lived a whole life helping starving children and dying villages, but she could never be declared a saint 'cause she never actually performed a miracle. And it was towards the end, she was desperate to perform a miracle, so she would go up to starving children and go, 'What's that behind your ear? It's a quarter!'"
Gilbert Gottfried,9/11,"With Katrina, it's almost like the sequel that doesn't live up to the original. It's certainly a shocking event and a tragedy, but somehow as a big event it doesn't seem to carry as much weight with the public as 9/11 did."
Gilbert Gottfried,,"I've done a lot of Fox shows since then - Married with Children, Living Single and a whole bunch of other Fox things."
Gilbert Gottfried,masturbation,How exactly do they prove that you've been masturbating? Do they dust for prints?
Gilbert Gottfried,,I host these bad movies late at night.
Gilbert Gottfried,,"The pressure to being a comedian is being funny, but I've given that up, so there is no pressure whatsoever."
Gilbert Gottfried,"celebrities,masturbation","Every time you open the paper now, there seems to be another celebrity getting arrest for masturbation. First, it was Peewee Herman and then George Michael. If masturbation's a crime, I should be on death row."
Gilbert Gottfried,,"Unfortunately, I've never been mistaken as Johnny Depp."
Gilbert Gottfried,,"I've always felt sorry for Jesus 'cause you know no matter what he ever did, he could never live up to his father."

Gilbert Gottfried,,"No, generally I think influence is used as a nice word for plagiarism."
Gilbert Gottfried,,"Well, I'm eventually gonna take the Daryl Hannah parts."
Gilbert Gottfried,,"I have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates. If you look up comedy and tragedy, you will find a very old picture of two masks. One mask is tragedy. It looks like it's crying. The other mask is comedy. It looks like it's laughing. Nowadays, we would say, ""How tasteless and insensitive. A comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask."""
Gilbert Gottfried,"religion,acceptance","I was talking to Jesus, and I said, ""Jesus, I feel like no one will ever accept me."" And Jesus looked at me and said, ""You know what my theory is? Accept me or go to hell."""
Gilbert Gottfried,,"I can't even find someone for a platonic relationship, much less the kind where someone wants to see me naked."
Gilbert Gottfried,"doctors,cancer","A man goes to the doctor for a check, and the doctor exams him and says ""I've got bad news, you've got cancer and alzheimers."" The man goes ""Thank god I don't have cancer."""
Gilbert Gottfried,,What do you get when you cross a genius with a hooker? A fucking know-it-all.
Gilbert Gottfried,,"Last night I was having dinner with Charles Manson, and in the middle of dinner he turned to me and said, ""Is it hot in here, or am I crazy?"""
Gilbert Gottfried,,"Well, I play Jews and parrots. Parrots are how I've branched out."
Godfrey,art,"I wish people would understand that comedy is an art form, and that the same thing that makes a Picasso painting is the same thing that gives Bill Cosby the ability to do an hour of comedy on his kids."
Godfrey,,"I observe everything around me and when something hits me and it’s funny, that’s what I talk about. I’m a more observational kind of comic."
Godfrey,,"If Mandela were a comedian, I bet he would never get mad at a heckler, he'd give him or her a hug."
Godfrey,,I love when they show the really gay prisoner in prison shows. He's the cutest inside but you know on the street he would be the ugliest.
Godfrey,advertising,"If they played the world hunger commercials with some dope beats, they'd probably get mad donations son!"
Godfrey,,"In the locker room. Some dude is staying a conversation with me. ""Hey not while you're drying your nutsack""."
Godfrey,,"The one thing you don’t want to be is a sucky clean comic. I hate sucky clean comics! It’s like Christian rock, bro. I’d rather listen to gospel and Christian rock. That’s cheating!"
Godfrey,differences,"I use profanity because I like profanity, but I’m not vulgar. Big difference. I love profanity because I really think profanity is cool."
Godfrey,,"I just want people to know, “this dude is a funny dude. I’m a fan of this dude. Now I’m looking forward to the next one.”"
Godfrey,girlfriends,Tell your girlfriend or wife you love them everyday. Like I do!
Godfrey,,"You've got to keep moving, keep creating."
Godfrey,racism,Want to shut a racist white guy's mouth. Put him around Super human athletic black dudes.
Godfrey,,I can always create new material. That's something I can control.
Godfrey,,"I got into trouble a lot in school. They say you're a disturbance in class. You're a distraction, they're moving you around. You never really get rewarded in class for being funny. You're a disturbance. But the funny kid is often witty and clever and quick... they finally get a chance to express themselves when they get out of school."
Godfrey,,"That's what I take pride in in my stand-up, is changing things up. Being special."
Godfrey,,"But there's times when I like to find the strange angles to something. People go, 'I heard a lot of jokes like that, but that's one of the most interesting takes I heard.' That's what I try to do."
Godfrey,,I'm forever a part of pop culture.
Godfrey,,I want to be able to go into a room of aliens and be funny. I don’t care who it is. I don’t ever want to limit myself to a type of comedy because I don’t want to be stuck. I want to be able to make anybody laugh and that’s the key for me.
Godfrey,,"I could be talking about cats and someone who’s a cat owner can go, “Hey man, you shouldn’t talk about cats!” and I’m like, “I bet you if your cat was sitting here he wouldn’t know what the fuck I was talking about.”"
Godfrey,,But some people want attention so bad they want you to see them angry at you.
Godfrey,,"I would say, as far as heckling, there’s benign and there’s malignant; like tumors man. Sometimes you get really nice hecklers. I’d say percentage-wise it’s only about 10 to 20 percent the whole year."
Godfrey,"advertising,school",You know your school is crappy when they advertise it on the subway.
Godfrey,,"My black friends in America don't believe me. I said, 'Dude, I'm Nigerian American.' 'Word? We thought you were, like, regular black.' What the hell is 'regular black'? Crayola coming out with colors I don't know about?"
Godfrey,,"You know what the bodega is? It's the little Latin store, and they try to act like it's a grocery store. It has two aisles. And the guy, he always tries to help me, 'You looking for the bread?' I was like, 'Dude, I can see it right here, alright.' He's like, 'Hey, hey, it's in aisle two.' That's all you got, what are you talking about?"
Godfrey,,The X-Games - I watch that; I'm not impressed. That's white dudes' desperation. They're running out of sports. They gotta find something that black dudes won't touch.
Godfrey,"intelligence,teachers","I was always the class clown, although many teachers view the class clown as a trouble maker. But I always had good grades, so the only thing my parents were told was that while I was intelligent, I talked too much."
Godfrey,,"Thanks for the shortest month, asses - and the coldest."
Godfrey,,"I went to University of Illinois. Big school. 35,000 students. 800 black… I was the only black in every class. Hard to be absent."
Godfrey,dancing,When my woman kisses me I start dancing like James Brown. Ow! I Feel Good!
Godfrey,homeless,"You ever pull out money too big in front of a homeless dude? You're like, 'Let me give you some - oh, shit.' He like, 'Give me that $100.' 'No, here's some pennies.'"
Godfrey,,"You know, the energy I think I was just born with. I think I was just always like that as I kid; I was always real energetic."
Godfrey,,"In general I believe in treating everybody nicely. I just think everybody doesn’t have to be an asshole. I just don’t understand why, because everybody wants to make it so badly when it comes to the fame and money, everybody turns to shit. I believe you can actually make money and be cool."
Godfrey,,"This is my life, man! You can’t tell me how to talk about my life. People come with that kind of arrogance like, “you need to be talking about this.” I say, “well you need to go listen to Christian comedy then.” It’s like listening to Christian rock, it just doesn’t count. You can either sing gospel or Catholic Church music, stay away from rock. You can’t rock a solo to Jesus, I’m sorry. No, I’m listening to Zeppelin dude."
Godfrey,,Customs is punishment for those who travel. This will teach you for traveling to our country!
Godfrey,"complaints,problems,white house","I think anybody that protests at a comedy club is too easy. If you have problems and issues, you need to go to the White House and complain to Congress. Don’t come to a comedy club and bitch. That’s too easy."
Godfrey,"parents,immigration,airports",My parents are immigrants. Came here with no money. Not this welfare thing. Welfare’s luxury… They came to the airport naked. “Can we get on the plane? I don’t want to show you where my passport is.”
Godfrey,chicago,"The weatherman gets to curse in Chicago - it's license, it's a law, I'm serious. 'What's the five day outlook? Holy shit. It's cold as fuck out, that's what it is.' And there's a picture of a snowman with his middle finger up."
Godfrey,,I think there are people living in Walmart dressed up as employees.
Godfrey,arguments,"Even if you get a joke right you’ve done it a thousand times and sometimes there’s times where it just doesn’t work or someone doesn’t agree with you. And I want to show that. I have had more hecklers because that’s part of comedy is arguments, you know?"
Godfrey,airports,I'm still trying to understand the wearing off high heels at the airport.
Godfrey,"complaints,asians","Be happy with your stereotype. Asians - that's the stereotype I want. Being the smartest person in the world? You're the smartest, what are you complaining about? You know what I get? 'Wassup?'"
Godfrey,,"I think that sometimes I’ve been a little too nice. I think you have to have a balance. When you’re too nice people take you for granted, they take you for a fool I think."
Godfrey,immigration,"Immigrants have been coming here for a long time. The Americans that are afraid of others coming were immigrants once themselves, so they have a lot of nerve. We have a lot of nerve as a country. The only people that should have xenophobia are Native Americans. Everyone else should shut up."
Godfrey,audience,"I think the audience should take away that it’s okay to be smart, it’s okay to be funny and well-learned. You can be from academia and be funny; you don’t have to be an idiot."
Godfrey,religion,People will bitch about anything. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t even have to necessarily be a serious topic like religion. It could be anything and people will have a problem. I’m telling you! It could be anything.
Godfrey,,Hey man! I’m a comedian but I’m not a clown.
Godfrey,,I used to think it was corny to be in love but actually it's corny to lose an awesome woman! Real talk.
Greg Behrendt,,"Don’t be flattered that he misses you. He should miss you. You are deeply missable. However, he’s still the same person who just broke up with you. Remember, the only reason he can miss you is because he’s choosing, every day, not to be with you."
Greg Behrendt,,"You picked a lemon, throw it away lemonade is overrated. Freaks should remain at the circus, not in your apartment. You already have one asshole. You don’t need another. Make a space in your life for the glorious things you deserve. Have faith."
Greg Behrendt,,"We have become a sloppy bunch of people. We say things we don't mean. We make promises we don't keep. ""I'll call you."" ""Let's get together."" We know we won't."
Greg Behrendt,,"If a man is really into you, nothing will stop him from being with you - including a fear of intimacy."
Greg Behrendt,,"If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you."
Greg Behrendt,,"Let’s start with this statistic: You are delicious. Be brave, my sweet. I know you can get lonely. I know you can crave companionship and sex and love so badly that it physically hurts. But I truly believe that the only way you can find out that there’s something better out there is to first believe there’s something better out there. What other choice is there?"
Greg Behrendt,,"Feeling in love  and fear feel a lot alike. They both give you that anxious butterfly feeling in your stomach, a sense of excitement, and a general unease physically and mentally. It's easy to confuse love with fear."
Greg Behrendt,inspiration,People are inspired to do remarkable things to find and be with the one they love.
Greg Behrendt,,The reason it's so painful when someone disappears is you have to face the fact that the person you loved had probably left you a long time before he grabbed his coat and scrammed.
Greg Behrendt,judgment,"He’s just not that into you if he only wants to see you when he’s drunk. If he likes you, he’ll want to see you when his judgment isn’t impaired."
Greg Behrendt,pain,"Drinking, eating, shopping, revenge, rebound sex, drugs or whatever your poison may be will number the pain - but that's all."
Greg Behrendt,,"I'm about to make a wild, extreme and severe relationship rule: the word busy is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word ""busy"" is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember men are never to busy to get what they want."
Greg Behrendt,,"If he's unsure, then he's unsure, and that's an answer - unsure is 'no.' The phrase 'I love you, but I'm not in love with you' really is this. The first 'I love you' means, 'I don't want to hurt you.' The second one means, 'I'm not in love with you.' That's bad news. 'I'm not in love with you' is 'I'm not in love with you.'"
Greg Behrendt,,I think the time it takes to feel better about a break up is directly proportional to the time it takes to feel better about yourself.
Greg Behrendt,,Two people in a relationship either grow together or apart over time.
Greg Behrendt,,This country is in a big hurry to go nowhere.
Greg Behrendt,,"I like the idea that when a guy comes over to the house, I get to say I wrote the book."
Greg Behrendt,,"I don't have to edit myself. I get to be me, warts and all, and that's ultimately what people want, and to trust each other implicitly."
Greg Behrendt,,"Part of being a comedian is that it's your job to look at life and regurgitate it in a funny way, to point out its absurdities."
Greg Behrendt,dating,I've never tried to pass myself off as anything more than a comedian who wrote a dating book.
Greg Behrendt,inspiration,"Don’t idolize anyone if you can. You know, be inspired by people, certainly, but don’t idolize people… Because they’ll let you down."
Greg Behrendt,,"Even with all the mayonnaise in the world, you can't make chicken salad out of chicken shit."
Greg Behrendt,challenges,Life's biggest rewards come from the biggest challenges.
Greg Behrendt,,Why should you feel honored for getting scraps of his time?
Greg Behrendt,,"I believe in love in hindsight, meaning attraction and connection can be remembered as love at first sight. But how could you possibly know at first sight? That's too much pressure to put on a relationship."
Greg Behrendt,,"There are only so many ways to get people to go see stand-up, that it really is about the product; it’s not so much about the theme of the show. "
Greg Behrendt,,Having feelings doesn’t mean you have to have sex.
Greg Behrendt,television,"I'm just not interested in daytime television, which is something you should remember the next time somebody offers you a daytime talk show."
Greg Behrendt,questions,"I’m the co-author of two relatively popular relationship books…Because of that I’m asked questions quite a bit… Questions about the relationships the person is in. Generally, it’s a woman. Generally, the answers are pretty easy. “I’ve been seeing this guy, Greg. And he doesn’t call.” He doesn’t like you. That’s it. We don’t have to say any more… They’ll say, “Greg, my boyfriend is married…” Say that back to yourself."
Greg Behrendt,,A man who wants to make a relationship work will move mountains to keep the woman he loves.
Greg Behrendt,,Always be classy. Never be crazy.
Greg Behrendt,,"Men would rather lose an arm out a city bus window than tell you simply, “You’re not the one.” We are quite sure you will kill us or yourself or both - or even worse, cry and yell at us."
Greg Behrendt,,"I believe in love the verb, not the noun."
Greg Behrendt,,"I think that God is disappointed in anal sex. I think he thinks to himself, “It’s just that I worked so hard on the vagina. I thought you guys would go crazy for it… It’s like the lobby of a great hotel. There’s carpeting and drapes and it’s warm. It’s an entry way and a exit way for babies, the greatest thing there is. And all you freaks want to do is to come in the back by the dumpster. I don’t get it!”"
Greg Behrendt,,"Remember always what you set out to get, and please don’t settle for less."
Greg Behrendt,change,"Sometimes people change their minds, sometimes they meet someone else, sometimes they get sober, and sometimes he was just a jerk who you’re lucky to be rid of."
Greg Behrendt,,"Men, for the most part, like to pursue women. We like not knowing if we can catch you. We feel rewarded when we do. Especially when the chase is a long one."
Greg Behrendt,,"If a guy is treating you like he doesn’t give a shit, he genuinely doesn’t give a shit. No exceptions."
Greg Behrendt,change,"For me, a breakup changed my entire life. I was a mess. I really got rocked, and I ended up turning it into a positive thing."
Greg Behrendt,,Everybody I know is bizarrely beautifully fucked up in some way.
Greg Behrendt,business,"I always say that I love magic but I hate magicians. I like being fooled. If you wave your hands in front of my face and I think you’re doing a trick, I’m easily impressed. If you pull a quarter out of my ear, I’m quite certain you’re a wizard. But I don’t like the way most magicians don’t act like they’re magical; they act like show business dicks."
Greg Behrendt,driving,"My grandma used to say ""Sound your Klaxon when you come around a turn."" And I'd say ""Shut your fucking Klaxon I'm driving!"" Oh we had fun."
Greg Behrendt,,It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that have to announce that I ate kale and liked it.
Greg Behrendt,pain,"Breakups hurt like a motherfucker, but they are not the end of the world. The pain is temporary, and if handled properly, they can even be life-changing."
Greg Behrendt,,"Lying, cheating, hiding is the exact opposite of the behavior of a man who’s really into you."
Greg Behrendt,,"There`s nothing wrong with sending a quick note if you`re busy or just want to flirt, but it`s hard to have any real interaction over text. In the buffet of communication, text messaging should be a side dish, not the entree."
Greg Behrendt,,"I love to eat. That's why I got so fat; I love to eat. If I don't walk away from a meal hurting, I didn't do it right. If I don't walk away from Thanksgiving dinner feeling like I've been turkey-fucked in a gingerbread prison, I didn't do it right."
Greg Behrendt,,I'm in an abusive relationship with butter. And I'm the only one getting hurt.

Greg Behrendt,pain,The pain of being in a bad relationship is confusing. When it’s over - it’s over. No more confusion!

Greg Behrendt,airports,"There are many different kinds of assholes in the world. But there's one particular kind of asshole that you see at the airport that's so annoying, and that is the person that is dressed like the destination to which it is they are flying. Do you know what I'm saying? The people that wear what they think the native costume of the land is that their going to.

Greg Behrendt,,Life is hard enough as it is without choosing someone difficult to share it with.
Greg Behrendt,,"Here's something else to think about: calling when you say you're going to is the very first brick in the house you are building of love and trust. If he can't lay this one stupid brick down, you ain't never gonna have a house baby, and it's cold outside."
Greg Behrendt,,"Let’s start with this statistic: You are delicious. Be brave, my sweet. I know you can get lonely.

But I truly believe that the only way you can find out that there’s something better out there is to first believe there’s something better out there. What other choice is there?"

Greg Behrendt,,"Part of me also knows that this generation is the least racist and most pro-gay, so that’s great. But they have a real lack of gravitas. And they have no taste in music. Vampire Weekend? Can we play some music, please? Can we rock out for a minute? Where’s your Metallica?"
Greg Behrendt,,I’m anal and forgetful. That’s a bad combo. That mean I like my shit where I like it and I don’t know where the fuck it is. But I’m pretty sure it’s your fault.

Greg Behrendt,,"It's very tempting when you really want to be with someone to settle for much, much less - even a vague pathetic facsimile of less - than you would have ever imagined.

Greg Fitzsimmons,,My kids teased me at dinner that I'm not cool. I told them if I was cool I wouldn't be sitting at home with my kids. Pass the gravy.
Greg Fitzsimmons,,"The United States of America will fare well so long as it has enough water to let it go to waste, both literally and figuratively. And he imagines how someone from an impoverished third-world nation must react to our collective nonchalant wasting of water, or of throwing money into fountains."
Greg Fitzsimmons,,I never know what I'm going to say as I walk up to the microphone. I try to be in the moment. I try to go deeper into myself. I discover things on stage that I don't discover off stage about me.
Greg Fitzsimmons,,"I've got a three year-old and he wants to rollerblade and he said, ""Daddy, I want to put on my helmet,"" and I said, ""Suck it up, kid. We don't wear helmets in this family; we're men. No, not on the sidewalk - get in the street."""

Greg Fitzsimmons,,"As a single couple, we are no longer able to hang around with married couples 'cause they cannot be in our presence without getting very annoying.

Greg Fitzsimmons,accidents,"Lieutenant Governor Paterson - blind, black guy - gets sworn in. First thing he says is, 'By the way, cheated on my wife. Let's just get that out in the open right now.' He didn't need to admit that. He's blind. Could have said it was an accident."
Greg Fitzsimmons,,"I think the Republicans took all the fun out of 'gay.' I mean the word gay - it's fun. But now it's a ban on same sex partners. That sounds horrible. I mean, when do you hear a ban? When it's a toxic pesticide or a nuclear warhead. And who wants to fuck a partner? It sounds like a guy in a gray suit at a law firm."

Greg Fitzsimmons,,"When you're not 21, it's great to drink because you're not allowed to. You're a rebel: you gotta get a fake I.D., you gotta find a place to drink it, you gotta sneak in drunk.

I'll let you know if I see anything.'"

Greg Fitzsimmons,,"I've finally been able to trust and have intimacy with somebody, which I've never been able to do. Like a lot of guys, I just have a hard time getting that connected.

Greg Fitzsimmons,"9/11,driving,airports","Last time I was out here was not too long after 9/11, and you could not drive a car to the airport at that time. That was one of the first safety precautions: only taxis could go to the airport. Because, really, what better way of stemming the flow of Muslims to the airport than only allowing taxis?"

Greg Fitzsimmons,,"These are the big breakthroughs in science and technology in the last 10 years: we have Rogaine, Prozac, now we have Viagra. You get a sense for who's bankrolling medical research in this country. It's just depressed, balding, white guys who can't get erections anymore.

Greg Fitzsimmons,accidents,"Years after he was castrated in a horrible industrial accident, she continued having kids, just out of habit - black kids, white kids, Chinese kids. We don't know how she did it - we know how she did it, we just don't like to talk about it."

I'll never eat raisins again."
Greg Fitzsimmons,,"Trickle-down economics - it didn't work. The whole idea was supply-side economics: give rich people a lot of money; they'll spend it, it'll go into the economy. Here's what we found out - rich people, really good at keeping all the money. That's how they got rich. If you want it in the economy, give it to the poor people.

Greg Fitzsimmons,worth,"I realized that every second that I'm alive, the world cares less about me. It's just a very linear, downward progression. And it sounds cynical because you guys are young and you're full with life. I want you to understand - this is it. You have nothing to look forward to because you're peaking. If you're not having fun now, kill yourself. I don't mean that in a bad way, just - it's not worth it to go forward."
Greg Fitzsimmons,christmas,Taking down the Christmas tree makes it feel official: time to get back to joyless and cynical.
Greg Fitzsimmons,,"My father told me when I first started that standup is exciting and I should pursue it, but that writing would be the thing that would give me power over my career.

Greg Giraldo,,I've always had real trouble knowing what my actual desires and goals are. I've just been dragged along by fate.
Greg Giraldo,"jail,marijuana","Why is marijuana not legal? It's a natural plant that grows in the dirt. Do you know what's not natural? Eighty-year-old dudes with hard-ons. That's not natural. But we got pills for that. We're dedicating all our medical resources to keeping the old guys erect, but we're putting people in jail for something that grows in the dirt?"
Greg Giraldo,,"A good joke provides tension, and then, release of that tension. You build the tension by saying things that are controversial. The release is the laugh. The bigger the surprise or insight in your joke, the bigger the laugh."
Greg Giraldo,,"Joke stealing is a big deal to me, but I mean, I’m not going to investigate it if it doesn’t effect me directly."
Greg Giraldo,girlfriends,"Valentine's day has gotten blown way out of proportion. Valentine's Day just used to be for your girlfriend or your wife but now everyone's like 'Oh, happy valentine's day!' I even got a Valentine's Day card from my grandmother. How ridiculous is that? We stopped having sex years ago!"
Greg Giraldo,"kids,doctors",A doctor was telling me a lot of people aren't getting their kids circumcised. How many people aren't doing it?

Greg Giraldo,homeless,"Once I saw a homeless man wearing his underwear on top of his pants. Now we say, why don’t the homeless just go out and get a job? If he’s wearing his underwear on top of his pants, I doubt his resume is in order, and I don’t think he’s going to make it too far in the interview process. In fact, I’m pretty sure that McDonald’s has a no underwear over your pant policy."

Greg Giraldo,dreams,"There’s been so much talk in the news lately about illegal aliens in the workplace. When was the last time an illegal alien stole your job? Oh yeah, that dream job of the Chinese Delivery man pedaling up Broadway delivering Chinese food for 40 cents an hour, or on the back of a landscaping truck with 15 others."
Greg Giraldo,,"If you spend five minutes with me or watch me try to balance my checkbook, you can only imagine the disaster I would make of anyone's legal issues."
Greg Giraldo,"kids,cars","Americans are not gonna conserve. We're not gonna shift to smaller cars. We can't - we have big, fat kids."
Greg Giraldo,,The reality is I'm not a 'get knocked down and come back harder' kind of guy.
Greg Giraldo,religion,The Virgin Mary... We have a whole religion based on a woman who really stuck to her story.
Greg Giraldo,,I’d vote for myself because I couldn’t possibly suck as bad as our other options.
Greg Giraldo,,"The internet's a creepy thing, especially if you have kids. It says something very creepy about the fact that I use the same machine to masturbate with as I use to teach my kid the alphabet."
Greg Giraldo,terrorists,"Terrorism is obviously on everybody's mind. The other day my son says to me, 'Daddy, how come the bad men hate us?' How sad is that? I actually got tears in my eyes - because he's 18. What kind of a moron am I raising?"
Greg Giraldo,advertising,"You know we have more prescription drugs now. Every commercial that comes on TV is a prescription drug ad. I can’t watch TV for four minutes without thinking I have five serious diseases. Like: “Do you ever wake up tired in the mornings?” Oh my god I have this, write this down. Whatever it is, I have this."
Greg Giraldo,,That show 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy' has been getting a lot of ratings. People love that show. That's a great idea for a show. You get four gay guys that try to make a straight guy gayer. That's a good idea for a show. We used to just call that Boy Scout camp.
Greg Giraldo,"government,asians,terrorists",You're gonna check my computer records? Is that important? I don't think the government needs to know how I feel about teen Asian sluts in order to fight terrorism.
Greg Giraldo,,"I think all gay guys should get married. I think they should have to get married. They should have to adopt kids because, actually, I'm getting tired of their happy-go-lucky lifestyle. I've had it with them being all happy and in shape. I could look good in denim short shorts and combat boots, too, if I had all day to do leg presses at the gym."
Greg Giraldo,babies,We're having one of those babies soon. I'm really excited about it because it's probably my first kid.
Greg Giraldo,,Peanut allergies. When did the peanut become the most toxic substance known to man? Have you tried going anywhere near a school with peanut butter? Holy shit! They look at you like you slathered it on your cock and went skipping across the playground!
Greg Giraldo,worth,We need more money for schools. We need more money for the kids. Ever think maybe the damn kids aren't worth it?
Greg Giraldo,,"It's something like 70% of American adults are obese, and the rest of them are women on Ally McBeal."
Greg Giraldo,,Gilbert Gottfried is famously cheap. I’m impressed you’re here Gilbert. You gotta buy new clothes and take a week off work just to do this. But you showed up. You tightened your belt and you came. You’re like David Carradine.
Greg Giraldo,,"I like when people give up chocolate for Lent. Ooh, just like being nailed to a cross."
Greg Giraldo,religion,"Seventy-two virgins - does that make sense to anyone? And it's an ancient religion, maybe it was misinterpreted? Maybe it's not 72 virgins, maybe it's a 7-foot-2 Persian."
Greg Giraldo,,Norm MacDonald is here - one of the funniest people ever. Norm's got a giant gambling problem. He's dropped more coin in a casino than Michael J. Fox at a parking meter.
Greg Giraldo,"holidays,christmas","Wallmart had their employees switch from saying “Merry Christmas” to “Happy Holidays”. How many Jews are really shopping at Wallmart? In fact, if you’re a Jew shopping at Wallmart, your life probably hasn’t gone as planned."
Greg Giraldo,,"They found two birds in Whitestone, Queens that were infected with the virus. Who finds these birds? I grew up in Queens. We used to find dead birds all the time. We didn't take them in for autopsies. We picked them up, and we threw them at the gay kid."
Greg Giraldo,corporations,"Sometimes you have to suffer a little bit in your youth to motivate yourself to succeed in later life. If Bill Gates had got laid in high school, do you think there'd be a Microsoft?"
Greg Giraldo,,There hasn’t been a more effeminate Jew in the closet since Anne Frank.
Greg Giraldo,,"There was this guy recently who sued his landlord because he said scalding water from the shower burned his genitals. That's a hell of a way to test the water, huh?"

Greg Giraldo,,"Remember Osama bin Laden? Public enemy number one. We gotta get bin Laden. Then the new season of 'American Idol' came on, we're like, 'Ah, forget it. Whatever.'"
Greg Giraldo,,"You got a cop under five feet tall, what if he's gotta plant evidence on a high shelf? What then? What if he's gotta chase a suspect onto a ride at Disneyland?"
Greg Giraldo,,"This friend of mine told me, 'Yeah, I dress this way to attract a guy, but I want to attract the right guy. I don't want to attract every slob on the street.' That's how cleavage works. It's not a smart bomb. It's not a laser-guided weapon. You might hit your target; there's also going to be a lot of collateral damage. You might hit the guy in the Porsche. You're also going to hit the guy with one tooth driving by on the bus."
Greg Giraldo,,All the evidence we need that God is angry with us is Justin Timberlake’s career.
Greg Giraldo,,How many of you text message? It’s a great way of not communicating.
Greg Giraldo,"alcohol,drugs,homeless","This homeless guy asked me for money the other day. I was about to give it to him and then I thought he was going to use it on drugs or alcohol. And then I thought, that's what I'm going to use it on. Why am I judging this poor bastard?"
Greg Giraldo,,"One time, I was trying to get on a plane. They wouldn’t let me. They said I was too drunk to get on a plane. You know how wasted you have to be for someone to say, “Sir, you’re just too drunk to sit in a seat.”"
Greg Giraldo,music,"If being a gangster were a prerequisite to being a musician, there’d be a lot less cello music, for example."
Greg Giraldo,,It's hard to distinguish when I was actually struggling from when I only felt like I was struggling - which was pretty much always.
Greg Giraldo,,You try not to have a favorite when you have sons or kids. Can’t have a favorite. Can’t let them know know if you do. I don’t. I treat my main son and the other two exactly the same way.
Greg Giraldo,,"Christine Todd Whitman had to resign as the head of the EPA; you know, when the governor of New Jersey decides the environment is hopeless, you gotta really think that one through."
Greg Giraldo,attitude,The reality is I'm not this person with this driving 'get it done' attitude.
Greg Giraldo,,"There are no black people in Iraq, so how will they know who to shoot at?"
Greg Giraldo,,When I masturbate I fantasize about having my own apartment. I used to think about Cindy Crawford now I think about leaving a dish in the sink overnight.
Greg Giraldo,,Ice-T is so old that the first thing he bought with the money from his album sales was his freedom.
Greg Giraldo,,"Look at Thomas Jefferson. The guy had illegitimate kids in the 1700s, and they caught him last year. If you cheat on your wife and cover it up for 200 years, you're pretty much thinking you're home free."
Greg Giraldo,decisions,"Even before the kids are born, you've go to make these decisions. If it's a boy, do we get him circumcised? If it's a girl, do we keep her?"
Greg Giraldo,laziness,"We’re a spoiled, lazy culture, full of ethnic pride that has to have a parade for every nationality."
Greg Giraldo,,"If you're going to dedicate your career to ranting about the excesses of American capitalism, you probably shouldn't weigh 450 pounds."

Greg Giraldo,,"Some people are just really goofy kind of guitar acts, and they go out and do these colleges and start making a fortune pretty early on. And other people - I know guys who are great comics, who've done the Letterman show many times, who still barely pay their bills."
Greg Giraldo,animals,"The Japanese scientists just found a 25,000-year-old mammoth in the ice in Siberia, and they're about to clone it... You think the Japanese of all people would want nothing to do with prehistoric animals after what happened with Godzilla."
Greg Giraldo,"dreams,driving",People come to this country from all over the world to pursue their dreams of driving a taxi or selling hot dogs or working in a sweatshop.
Greg Giraldo,,"The NRA is not pro-gun, they’re anti-varmint."

Greg Giraldo,television,There are more whipped guys on television than there were on the Amistad.
Greg Giraldo,,"If you join a gym, you gotta go a lot for it to work. I don't know how these gay guys do it. It's unbelievable. Every gay guy I know is built like a bodybuilder. When did that start happening? That's totally gonna change the stereotype, right? It's gonna be like, 'Do you think that guy's gay? Is he gay?' 'Oh yeah. He benches, like, 450 pounds.'"
Greg Giraldo,,"Part of growing up is learning your strengths and weaknesses. What better way to figure out that hand-eye coordination ain't your thing than by getting drilled in the mouth by a red, rubber ball? You only gotta get beaned in the face so many times before you figure out, 'I better hit the books because this is not working out.'"
Greg Giraldo,,"When I heard you could get a disease from playing with your prairie dog, I thought, 'Wow, what a euphemism.' I thought playing with my prairie dog was the best way to avoid diseases."
Greg Giraldo,,"Christine Todd Whitman had to resign as the head of the EPA. You know, when the governor of New Jersey decides the environment is hopeless, you gotta really think that one through."
Greg Giraldo,danger,"A dangerous fire retardant chemical is being found in women's breast milk. My wife's breastfeeding, but you know, you gotta be an optimist. I'm like, well, maybe it's making my child fireproof."
Greg Giraldo,terrorists,You think they could stop putting these experts on the news with their doomsday scenarios of how the terrorists might attack us? Because you get the sense they're coming up with ideas that these people haven't thought of themselves.
Greg Giraldo,,Do you know how short you have to be to have a Napoleon complex in North Korea?
Greg Giraldo,dancing,"It's all about self-esteem now. Build the kids' self-esteem, make them feel good about themselves. If everybody grows up with high self-esteem, who's gonna dance in our strip-clubs?"
Greg Giraldo,,"Some people say Larry the Cable Guy’s only successful because he’s pandering to the lowest common denominator, blatantly and not ironically exploiting people’s racist and homophobic tendencies. Don’t listen to these people, Larry. They’re just bitter and jealous and right."
Greg Giraldo,gays,George Bush says that gay people getting married would violate the sanctity of marriage. Is anybody here married? Does it feel like a gift from God to you?
Greg Giraldo,intelligence,"The things that make me laugh are considered smart or whatever, I guess. But stuff that's self-consciously intelligent or self-consciously hip or cool, that doesn't do it for me either. You just try to be funny."
Greg Giraldo,,The only reason we're not in Iran now is because we're going alphabetically and George Bush can't spell.
Greg Giraldo,"driving,terrorists","If I drive my SUV I’m supporting terrorism. Okay, I’ll take a taxi, Is that better?"
Greg Proops,,"Bush looked straight into the camera and said 'We must preserve the sanctity of marriage!' You know, straight people are doing such a fucking great job."
Greg Proops,,"Think about everything you read and everything you see. The one thing we can learn from all the horrible things that have happened in the last 15-20 years is that hysteria is the last thing we need. Cool thinking, pragmatism, and analytical thought are most important at this point."
Greg Proops,,"I think if you steal well, you’re a genius. If you copy badly, you’re a hack."
Greg Proops,,"If you do not find me funny, that is your problem and I am not going away."
Greg Proops,ice cream,"White pants should be worn on two occasions: One, never. And two, if you're selling ice cream."
Greg Proops,,"Oh, I say I have an ocelot and it’s a joke, but I’ve had so many news programs in this country say, ""So what’s it like, having an ocelot?” And I’ll say, “It’s marvelous just to see them run free. When feeding time comes and they’re mewling, it just warms your heart."" People will really believe anything. You may have noticed this. It’s not just me. Look around."
Greg Proops,,"Obviously the name of the show is a joke, a friend of mine gave it to me. But some people are very literal. Sometimes you see things like ""He's not the smartest man in the world! All he does is drink."" Well, they're not listening very closely."
Greg Proops,honesty,Honesty and unpopular opinions are the toughest sell in a country with an irony-deficiency.
Greg Proops,christmas,"It's christmas. You know, the time of the year that reminds you what you don't fucking have."
Greg Proops,,"How come we got the grumpy boat of bandy-legged Puritans? How come we didn't get the Italian party boat with the cappuccino makers and the gelato machine? That was the sexy boat, man."
Greg Proops,"animals,society,nowdays",Animals have two vital functions in today's society: to be delicious and to fit well.
Greg Proops,"smoking,restaurants","You can't smoke in a restaurant in Los Angeles, which is mildly ironic, when you consider the fact that you can't breathe outside a restaurant in Los Angeles."
Greg Proops,waitresses,"I’m as bouge as the next person. My mother was a waitress and my father was a bartender. People think I went to Yale and shit, because I have a vocabulary and I wear a suit. I wear a suit because I aspire to wear a fuckin’ suit. I didn’t work my whole fuckin’ life to wear a Hello Kitty fuckin’ wifebeater up here."
Greg Proops,knowledge,I’m old and my knowledge is strictly horizontal.
Greg Proops,hollywood,"I like to go to England, and I'll tell you why. I like to go to a country where I am considered the best-looking person. It's as simple as that. Hollywood, kind of a crushing ego blow - 'Hey Buddy Holly, you are so old, have you not perished in a plane crash?' But not in England, good God, not there. In England, God bless that dinky island, there it's, 'Good God, look at him. He has all his teeth and his ears are in proportion to his head.' I'm Brad bloody Pitt on that island."
Greg Proops,,"If you want to live in 'white world,' if you want to experience the stultifying boredom and penetrating ennui that homogeneity can bring, you can go to Canada any day of the year. It's an entire country named Doug."
Greg Proops,,Talking to the British about sex is like talking to Americans about reading. Nobody does it so why talk about it?

Greg Proops,,Why does everyone leave just when its getting’ good?

Greg Proops,,"They celebrate Thanksgiving in England, by the way. It’s called “Fuck off puritan!”"
Greg Proops,,"I did stand up first in high school, joined an improv group in college, kept doing stand up after that, no one could deter me. And I have no other skills really, so I’m sorta stuck with this now. It’s a little late to switch over to an ornithologist."
Greg Proops,smoking,You're in a bar - grow up. You're drinking poison. You're trying to have sex unsafely with someone you don't know. Is secondhand smoke really the chiefest of your health concerns at this point?
Greg Proops,,"I would never advocate the use of dope because, you know, I'm not a professional athlete and I don't have access to the good stuff."
Greg Proops,,"My feeling is, the Pilgrims were asked to leave England. England was never funner than when the Pilgrims split, right? The people of England got a little tired of these dour, right-winged conservative psycho-Christians wearing all black, bumming people out, confusing everyone by wearing buckles on... their heads. ""Is that tight enough for you, Cotton?"" ""Yea, verily.”"
Greg Proops,,"I like the night life, I like to boogy."
Greg Proops,"care,animals","My feeling is, we ran from animals for three million years. It’s our time now. If a cow could eat you, it would. And it wouldn’t care how comfortable your truck ride over was, either."
Greg Proops,,"I work for a few at home who are devoted. People who are up now. Either they have some sort of bladder problem or they're extremely drunk. This is my crowd, these are the people I hope to get."
Greg Proops,,"Wine me, dine me, Deep Space Nine me."
Greg Proops,,"Whoo! Heidi! Little goat girl, you are kicking the jam. You've got my lederhosen in a situation."
Greg Proops,animals,I love animals. I couldn't eat a whole one but I'll split one with you if you want.
Greg Proops,,"Let me tell you about Australia. It’s really, really, really, far from wherever you live on Earth. You fly and you fly and you fly. Then relativity takes over and you get younger and younger. And when you land, you’re a gleam in your father’s eye."
Greg Proops,,"Good evening, I am The Proclaimers."
Greg Proops,,"I have to hear this all the time in England: ""Well, all Americans are fat and stupid, mm-hm-hm-hm-hm."" Really? Well, thanks for sending over the best and brightest to start the party. Maybe we can send a few freaky, Texas, militia, hate-group, gun-toting weirdoes back to your country."
Greg Proops,"smoking,cancer","I understand that smoking is vaguely inappropriate in certain situations. You know, like an orphanage, cancer ward, whatever."
Greg Proops,,"I think comedy should be left up to the professionals, that way everyone’s safety is protected."
Greg Proops,,"Mm-mm, no, thank you, no, I don't want an enchilaaadaaa. Nor do I want a burr-eye-to. Or a tay-co. Or any other bizarre, unneccessary vowel substitutions."
Greg Proops,,"In our world, all puns are beautiful and they are the highest form of comedy."

Greg Proops,,"Now, we're Americans. Technically, who is from this country? Only the Indians, who we graciously let dwell on their native casinos."
Greg Proops,,You sound heck-a-fun!
Greg Proops,television,"People are tired of this mainstream shit; television and radio is ghastly and the public can smell the corporate meeting. When you watch a show with Simon Cowell, you know no human touch has been near it, that they've carefully engineered the outcome and picked those they're going to humiliate. We live in an age of information glut, but so many people don't question what they're spoon-fed or bother to search for themselves."
Greg Proops,,"I'm always looking for that place, you know, where there's no rednecks, that place where people get along, and I never find it. I went to Australia, right, and I thought Australia was gonna be a groovy, surfnoid, smoke-a-joint wombat, you know? 'G'day mate!' 'No worries!' And it's like Arkansas with a beach. It's a whole country with a 'No Fat Chicks' sticker on it."
Greg Proops,"confidence,audience",I don't come on to seduce the audience. I don't care if everyone laughs. I can't think about that anymore. If there's anything that a lot of experience on stage and a lot of stage time gives you is the confidence to know that it's ok if they're not laughing every second you're up there. Although that's what drives me and I still go too fast a lot of the time.
Greg Proops,white people,"You leave white people alone in constant isolation for thousands of years, you know what their musical contribution is going to be?… Riverdance."
Greg Proops,,It’s a Spice Girl party & since we’re missing one I’m the new one Specky Spice.
Greg Proops,,"I don't want comedy to be Bridesmaids 2. I'm not denigrating Bridesmaids but, enough already, let's stop pretending women are incalculably different to us. Seeking out podcasts, listening on headphones, it's like an intimate, specific conversation. People respond if it feels from the heart. I'm as neurotic a human being as lives, and I have my faults. I'm a drunk. But people really like that."
Greg Proops,,Do ten or fifteen minutes up front of likeable material and then go to your vile self.
Greg Proops,,No one is a natural – you have to work at being a natural.

Greg Proops,,I have a giant fish head on… I’m 42 fucking years old.
Hannibal Buress,"confidence,restaurants","Whenever I eat at a restaurant I never put the napkin in my lap. People say, 'Hannibal, why don't you put the napkin in your lap?' Because I believe in myself. I believe in my ability to not spill food in my pants 'cause I'm a goddamn adult. And I've mastered the art of getting food from my plate to my mouth without messing up my jeans. You need to believe in yourself, too and get your life together, that's for babies. Have some confidence in your eating abilities and hand/eye coordination."
Hannibal Buress,,"The jokes now, it’s just more stories and personal experiences. And just talking about things that really happened. It’s just becoming more comfortable as a performer, sharing my opinions on things, or things that’ve happened to me. That’s where it’s really going."
Hannibal Buress,,'SNL' is the first real job I've held for more than a month and a half.
Hannibal Buress,cancer,"I don't believe in cancer walks. Well, I believe in them because they exist but I'd rather just give money straight up and save my Saturday afternoon. I can make my own t-shirt, that's not incentive. Plus I don't think cancer responds to how far people walk. I don't think cancer's sitting at home, 'What? How many people walked how far? How many people walked how far wearing the same shirt? That's crazy! I'm out of here!' Remission."
Hannibal Buress,,If you were scared of that movie then you had a easy life.
Hannibal Buress,,"I like showing different types of comedy - showing that I could tell a story, or showing that I could do a one-liner, showing I could do stuff about music – so just trying to be versatile and talking about different topics."
Hannibal Buress,,Sometimes when I watch porn I get my hoodie on so I feel creepier. Sometimes I get under computer so it feels like I’m spying on her.
Hannibal Buress,,"It’s fine if you want to be a feminist, but I think 5 AM after the bar closes is a weird time to jump on your soapbox. “Men just want to fuck.” It’s five in the morning, everybody wants to. That’s why they stayed out ‘til five because it didn’t happen at two."
Hannibal Buress,,I like burritos more than Jesus because steak burritos are delicious. And they’re real.
Hannibal Buress,questions,"I applied for a job at Starbucks. One of the questions was, 'Why do you want to work at Starbucks?' Uh, because my life is in shambles."
Hannibal Buress,,"My nephew's always crying. I'm like, 'Dude, why are you crying? Your life is great. All you do is eat apple sauce and take dumps. That's your day.'"
Hannibal Buress,,"I have weird aspirations. Like, I really want to kick a pigeon."
Hannibal Buress,,I’m a dumb guy. My point of view is limited.
Hannibal Buress,neighborhood,There's a lot of dudes in my neighborhood that have handlebar mustaches. Which is cool if you want to have a handlebar mustache but don't try to have a conversation with me like you don't have a handlebar mustache.
Hannibal Buress,weed,"I don't even know how to use a semicolon to this day; I use a comma every time. And you know what? If I email somebody and they get upset about me using a comma instead of a semicolon, that's not a person I want to work with anyway. And that's how you weed people out of your life."
Hannibal Buress,comedians,I love stand-up. I look at it as a way to always stay productive. I couldn't imagine only being an actor or a writer. Because what the hell do I do when I'm not working? Mope?
Hannibal Buress,ex-girlfriend,"My first regular comedy gig, I hosted an open mic in my college town… One show, I had an ex-girlfriend who showed up to perform. I had to introduce her to the stage. It was very awkward. “Coming to the stage is the cold-hearted bitch who broke my heart. You may know her for not returning my phone calls and also giving out mediocre blowjobs.”"
Hannibal Buress,,I don't want to die before Will Smith 'cause then I miss that awesome 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' marathon.
Hannibal Buress,,"If you want to do anything, you got to go do it. Perform a lot, write a lot, make yourself better. Use the Internet, make videos, create content."
Hannibal Buress,,Somebody said they were going to bring an 11-year-old to my show tonight. I'm not gonna tone it down for no 11-year-old.
Hannibal Buress,talent,"I'd like to get more bit-acting roles. I don't know if my talent would allow for a long dialogue, but I could definitely knock out three lines. I'd kill it."
Hannibal Buress,,"People like to compare something to something that they know. Even with Chris Rock, they say he's like Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy."
Hannibal Buress,questions,"""I'm a gangsta, and gangstas don't ask questions."" Yes they do ask questions! I thought that was a main point of being a gangster. ""Hey, muthafucka, where's my money?"" That's a question. ""Do you want to die tonight?"" That's a question too. ""What? What?"" That's two questions."
Hannibal Buress,,"I was out with this girl; I bought some drinks. We went back to my hotel room, she starts throwing up the drinks that I bought all over the hotel room; it was very upsetting. It was like she was throwing up my money on my money."
Hannibal Buress,chicago,"In my hometown of Chicago, I'm kind of a medium deal."
Hannibal Buress,,I don’t really go to record stores much anymore. The internet has spoiled me. I’d rather just hit up iTunes. You never know what could happen when you go into a store - somebody might pull a Tonya Harding on you and break your knee cap. And now you got your knees all fucked up just ‘cause you wanted to get that vinyl.
Hannibal Buress,,I’ve been going up and bombing everywhere. It’s great. I love it. It’s hilarious.
Hannibal Buress,,"God sounds kinda like a shitty father to me. If God was so powerful why’d he have to give his son up? It sounds like God owed someone some money and they couldn’t get to him, so they murked his son. That’s what I really think happened. Jesus got stabbed up in an alley… but it’s easier to sell crucifixes. You can’t sell a pendant of someone getting shanked up In the alley. It’s a marketing scheme."
Hannibal Buress,,"I can work as a writer, but I wanted to do stand-up. And I knew I could, at worst, work as a stand-up. And I like to travel, and I knew I wanted to do an hour special, so in order to get ready for that, I had to hit the road."
Hannibal Buress,,"I know some of you got upset when I called that woman a cunt, but someone steals over a thousand dollars from me I call ‘em what the fuck I want."
Hannibal Buress,,"Was coming out of the store earlier, I just bought some Oreos and some Chips Ahoy. So I get outside, there's this guy like, 'Hey brother, it's my birthday today.' And that was the first time in my life, without any sarcasm, I could say, 'What? You want a cookie or something?' Because any other time you say that, you being mean, but I meant it from my heart. 'How many cookies you want, man? You want seven cookies? That's way too many cookies. You're being ridiculous right now. You can take, like, three or four cookies and get out of my face. Otherwise you're taking advantage of my generosity.'"
Hannibal Buress,,"""We'll keep you in our thoughts"" With the other bullshit in your heads? No, keep me out of your thoughts, because I hear some of the stuff you talk about and if that's close to what you're thinking about, I don't want to be around that, so keep me and my family out of your thoughts, unless you're thinking of making me a sandwich."
Hannibal Buress,,"I don't like when people say, 'I'll pray for you. I'm going to pray for you. Praying for you.' You're going to pray for me? So you're going to sit at home and do nothing? 'Cause that's what your prayers are; you doing nothing while I struggle with a situation. Don't pray for me - make me a sandwich or something."

Henny Youngman,,A Polish guy locked his keys in the car. It took an hour to get his wife out.
Henry Cho,,I'm going old school. Adult comedy but you can have your kids in the room. Kind of Andy Griffith meets Bill Cosby meets Bob Newhart. Also my character isn't an idiot as all the rest of the sitcoms recently have the dad character like Homer Simpson.
Henry Cho,asians,"I’m an Asian with a Southern accent. To a lot of people, that right there is funny."
Henry Cho,,"So, I’m from the South. So I guess that makes me South Korean."
Henry Cho,,"My comedy is for adults, but you can have your kids listen to it. They won't get all the jokes because hopefully I'm more cerebral than a 10-year-old... but if you ask my wife, I'm not!"
Henry Cho,,"My wife gets mad because we'll be in the middle of something and I'll stop and say, 'No, I've got to write this down!' She'll say, 'No! We're in a discussion!' I say, 'I know, but it's hilarious!'"
Henry Cho,,"I think my one of my strengths in standup is my ability to adlib. I do all my best writing on stage. I can sit down and write jokes, but I'd rather go on stage with a premise or an idea and let the jokes come that way. My creative juices are never flowing any better than when I'm onstage."
Henry Cho,,"In the early days I was on the road 45-50 weeks a year, driving from gig to gig 6-8 weeks in a row. Not everyone can do that. The show becomes the easy part. Tt's the life on the road that is the hardest... and you can't get any good at standup unless you do the road."
Henry Cho,,"I pride myself on never using a cuss word on stage. Ever. I headline in Las Vegas every year, and this summer I am performing on an Alaskan cruise. Not too many comedians can pull that off. Funny thing is, my show doesn’t change for Vegas."
Henry Cho,,"I’m smart cause I’m Korean, I’m not so smart cause I’m from the south. They cancel each other out, so I’m even."
Henry Cho,,"Growing up, I loved Bill Cosby and Bob Newhart. They are a big reason I’m a storyteller because they are two of the best."
Henry Cho,,"As a comedian, I have the gift of looking at something a bit differently and making it funny. I’m not sure why I can do that, but that’s as simple as I can put it."
Henry Cho,,College is great. It’s the only time in life where you can write a check for 39 cents... and bounce it.
Henry Cho,nowdays,"Comedy today is definitely skewed to the filthy side, but it’s not as hard today as I am more mature as a comedian and a person. I’m a grown up now doing a kid’s job. Being a more mature Christian these days makes it easier than when I first started. Now I get to do shows of my choosing and a lot of folks attending the shows know my work and expect a clean show."
Henry Cho,,My way of telling stories is kind of what I do naturally. It's no different from how I would talk to you if you were in my living room.
Henry Cho,soccer,"My show is an adult comedy show, but it isn’t offensive. Your kids could listen to it, even though I hope they wouldn’t ‘get’ most of it. But I get a lot of fan mail from soccer moms saying ‘I love having your CD because I can listen to it with my kids in the car.’"
Henry Cho,,"My comedy is adult humor, but clean. It’s not campy. I’ve always worked in the mainstream and I’ve never billed myself as a “Christian comedian.” I’m just a comedian who’s a Christian."
Henry Cho,,I have one show biz picture in my house. It's with Mr. Hope. I have asked for one autograph in my life: Mr. Hope's.
Henry Cho,care,"Guys take care of your wife when she’s pregnant. Don’t say stupid stuff either, like me. I came home one time. My wife’s six months pregnant. She’s lying on the couch. There’s food and clothes everywhere. And I walked in and went, “What’d you do today?” Don’t do that. My wife looked up and said, “Today? I don’t know, Henry. Let’s see… what did I do today? Today I made a lung.”"
Henry Cho,,"My wife at times will say I'm stubborn, selfish, insensitive, vague, deaf at times, blah, blah, blah... but she's never said I was boring!"
Henry Cho,"family,swimming",My family is number one in my life. I'll blow off writing or just about anything to make sure I take my son to preschool or watch him at his swimming lesson.
Henry Cho,,"Sharks attack surfers because they look like a seal. Apparently, when you’re layng on your board and you have your arms and legs hanging off, from underneath you look like a seal. So I just got a picture of a seal and put a red line through it and put it underneath my board."
Henry Cho,dating,"My standup has always been a direct reflection of my life. When I was single, I talked about single stuff. I talked about dating. When I got married there were only a handful of stories I could move over to where I wasn't going to be disrespectful to my wife. So I developed a new routine."
Henry Cho,jail,"Their cousin got in a fight and they put him in jail. I had to go get him out. He came walking out going, 'Hey, man, I tried to call you on the cellphone.' I said, 'You don't have a cellphone.' He goes, 'I mean, the phone by the cell.'"
Howie Mandel,experience,"I needed time to stand back and go through a lot more experience in life. Then I have something to write about, joke or to animate."
Howie Mandel,,My whole life is a practical joke. Every evening and every show has really become about entertaining me. I was always like that. And now I've come full circle because that's what the TV show is too.
Howie Mandel,,We don't want to make them uncomfortable. It doesn't seem like anybody seems to be uncomfortable. We seem to get along.
Howie Mandel,,"Terry was so angry; she kept saying we have to meet with these people at parent-teacher conferences. But in the midst of this anger, I realized there's something funny about the way these pieces affect my life, and I realized there was a show in this, a hybrid where you could see the hidden cameras juxtaposed with this normal domestic life that I lead."
Howie Mandel,,People who annoy people are the luckiest people in the world.
Howie Mandel,importance,"I was never brave before. I always tried to make it work. Now I have nothing to lose except some cash, and it's just not that important to me. I've never been allowed up until now to remain who I am, or true to what my life is like."
Howie Mandel,,"Everything runs its course. We had told a lot of stories that happened in our life. My kid was getting older, and we were running out of stories to tell."
Howie Mandel,,I am beloved by millions.
Howie Mandel,,"She was so helpful and so sweet and so giving. I call it the food-poisoning effect. Everybody knows where they got food poisoning. We take that first bite and there's kind of an awful taste or a bad smell. You knew it was a little off, but you just kept going."
Howie Mandel,,"I'm fascinated by mankind. I grew up watching 'Candid Camera' and thought it was funnier than any standup, any joke, anything that could possibly be written because you're dealing with humanity. And people can relate to that. It touches everybody who sees it. It hits a nerve."
Howie Mandel,,I've been chased. I've been pushed. I've been screamed at. I've been verbally abused. I've been afraid for my safety. But I did it all in the name of entertainment.
Howie Mandel,,"I was totally involved in Bobby's World from the time we started the idea to sitting with the artists on how he would look, to the script meetings, the music, the lyrics, the songs."
Howie Mandel,money,You can go home with a lot of money with absolutely no skill.
Howie Mandel,,"I've had people come up to me, as home viewers, and tell me they were screaming at the TV, yelling at each other, yelling at the contestants."
Howie Mandel,,It's heart-wrenching because they often need the money.
Howie Mandel,"comedians,success,experience",The success of any stand-up act comes out of life experience.
Howie Mandel,success,"When I went into Bobby's World, I had no idea it would be a success. I had been doing the Bobby voice as part of my nightclub adult act for years."
Howie Mandel,,"If my mom came here today, she'd probably join this red-hat brigade. My mother got my sense of humor, even when I was a kid. I would just do things that tickled my fancy in the moment, and she would ask me who I was entertaining. I'd say, 'Well, me.' And she would tell me that nobody knew that and they thought I was psychotic. Well, I don't ever want people to think I'm psychotic, but I can't help myself from doing these things."
Howie Mandel,,"We get up early Sunday morning, and we have cereal and orange juice and we make crank calls."
Howie Mandel,,Bobby's World touched a lot of people. That's why the family's last name is Generic. Uncle Ted is based on uncles we've all had.
Howie Mandel,,Now I have new stories and I feel refreshed. There is talk of Bobby's World eventually coming back. I would be happy to do that.
Howie Mandel,"worth,work","It's really not that hard. If I do a Tonight Show, it's six or seven minutes. If I do a concert, it's 90 minutes. If I do an interview, that's 15 minutes. So by the end of the day I've done three hours worth of work."
Howie Mandel,,There were 84 original episodes. It was rated No. 1 and No. 2 on the Fox Children's Network. We figured it was time to make it available to people who have never watched it.
Howie Mandel,,"My point of reference is life, in everything that I do."
Howie Mandel,,"You release these things, and if they fly then you have more."
Howie Mandel,,"I'm from Canada, so Thanksgiving to me is just Thursday with more food. And I'm thankful for that."
Howie Mandel,,"We sat down and told stories that happened to us in our childhood, to our children. They were all basically based on the truth. These stories were funny and poignant to us. They just took off. These are all stories from my life."
Howie Mandel,experience,We were a very small circle of writers. Everybody brought to the table their own life experience.
Howie Mandel,,"I was the voice of Bobby. So while I was doing the show, I was also a father. It did reflect how I tried to handle things in my own home."
Howie Mandel,,There's no skill. You can be a rock and move into another cash bracket.
Howie Mandel,,"I thought that was funny, but nobody else did. I was mostly entertaining myself, though. My parents both had a great sense of humor, and always laughed a lot. One night, when they were watching Candid Camera, I finally understood what comedy was all about. I heard the laughter on television, I turned around and saw my parents laughing, and that's when I thought: 'This is great. This is what I can do. I'm gonna prank somebody.'"
Howie Mandel,comedians,"If I'm a game show host, will someone buy a ticket to see me do standup? To do a dramatic role in a movie?"
Howie Mandel,,"We did it for nine years, No. 1, and the Fox Children's Network moved it into a different direction, of the Power Rangers and other stuff."
Iliza Shlesinger,,"It feels amazing to just be here and be able to share my jokes with the world. It’s not so much about being a girl, it’s about being a funny comic."
Iliza Shlesinger,,You look like the kind of woman who dates guys in prision.
Iliza Shlesinger,,"You know what happened the last time a group of people said, 'Screw it, we don't care what you think'? They got hung as witches."
Iliza Shlesinger,,"You can’t go to the bathroom alone… you might not come back. Cause no girl’s ever been to the bathroom alone and survived. It’s true. The last woman that attempted it, it was 1937 and her name was Amelia Earhart."
Iliza Shlesinger,,I don't hate other women. Let me rephrase that: I hate other women and men - people in general can be annoying - but I've never disliked a woman for being beautiful.
Iliza Shlesinger,,Passion always finds a way. Follow your passion and everything else will work out.
Iliza Shlesinger,,"When you ask a girl out and she suggest a bar, you're answer shouldn't be ""great, I like that bar and they'll have the Rockets game on too."""
Iliza Shlesinger,audience,"I don’t come up with ideas, they come to me. I write them down and try to convey what's wrong with me to the audience as best I can."
Iliza Shlesinger,,"I always wished my dad was there to intimidate my boyfriends or something. It's supposed to be your dad giving your guys friends the stink-eye for sneaking beer through your house, not your mom."
Iliza Shlesinger,dancing,"I don’t tend to like race jokes. I don’t like Jew jokes and black jokes, and they make me very uncomfortable, probably because I’m both. Well, I’m not black - but if I was then I could dance better."
Iliza Shlesinger,differences,"Ladies, just know that when you grow your hair too long, you got about two inches difference between really hot, sexy supermodel - religious fanatic. Hot Maxim cover girl everybody wants a mouth kiss - unhealthy faith in your lord. Soft, silky, shiny hair everyone wants to touch - one of 12 brides."
Iliza Shlesinger,,If I could have any job I would be a cat… but that’s not something I’m supposed to talk about in public.
Iliza Shlesinger,men,"There are two types of men: those who are intimated by a girl like me, and those who are not. You don't have to like me, but you don't have to be a dick about it. And after a lifetime of dealing with this, I'm pretty well-equipped, verbally, to cut anyone down at any time."
Iliza Shlesinger,,You're not a road comic till you've watched Real Sex and American Greed alone in your hotel room.
Iliza Shlesinger,,"I grew up watching and admiring Adam Sandler, it started with “Saturday Night Live and his albums, then I became a huge fan of his movies. “SNL”, “Kids in the Hall,” and “In Living Color” – their characters were huge influences and eye openers to other worlds of comedy for me."
Iliza Shlesinger,,"Both are salty, one will give me carpal tunnel, I’ll go with the fries."
Iliza Shlesinger,acceptance,"As a comedian, as an entertainer, there's a lot of downtime. Once you can accept that comedy is a marathon, not a sprint, it gets a little easier."
Iliza Shlesinger,,I wasn't a 'hot chick' in high school. I was 'funny' and a tomboy and probably a little uncomfortable with my amazing boobs.
Iliza Shlesinger,,"Everyone has their personal topics. My comedy has always been very strong on observational humor, it stems from what I see every day in my life."
Iliza Shlesinger,honesty,"When you're missing your two front teeth, that's honesty. That is a door to your oral history. You're not covering anything up. You're saying, 'Hey world, I'm missing my front teeth. I'm gross; I'm dirty; I'm poor. I clearly have no problem with public urination and eating garbage. Don't come near me, I'll gum you to death!'"
Iliza Shlesinger,,The weekend represents the 48 hours that you have to fuck up the life you worked so hard for all week.
Iliza Shlesinger,complaints,"Most modern girls don’t really know what hiking is. To the average girl, hiking is: you wake up whenever you want; you put on Lululemon ‘cause they make your butt look unreasonably good - and they should for 800 fucking dollars - and you go for a walk in the park with your best friend and complain about how hungover you are. That’s hiking."
Iliza Shlesinger,"animals,dating",It’s our first date but I don’t want to go on a date. I wanted to do it in the daylight with animals so it couldn’t be misconstrued as anything in case he’s the worst.
Iliza Shlesinger,,"It said, 'War Is Not the Answer.' I disagree. I think war absolutely is the answer. And if you don't agree with me, happy Fourth of July."
Iliza Shlesinger,"christmas,new york","I was in New York last Christmas - it's snowing; there's a guy in a t-shirt. I'm like, 'Dude, aren't you cold?' 'No, I'm from New York. I don't get cold.' Just 'cause you're from a cold place doesn't mean you're genetically predisposed to not feeling cold. You're not a penguin. I was like, 'In fact, sir, you're Puerto Rican, so if anything, you should be more cold.'"
Iliza Shlesinger,dating,"I didn’t “date” in college, I kind of always had a boyfriend. Just because I make jokes on a dating show doesn’t mean I’m Carrie Bradshaw."
Iliza Shlesinger,christmas,"I'm not even 1000% sure that polar bears exist. How do you know? Why, 'cause Coca-Cola puts them on their can during Christmas? They also put Santa Claus, what's your fucking point?"
Iliza Shlesinger,audience,"When you get off stage, the audience should know a little bit about you. Not where you are from, but how you see the world. And that’s the difference between like a Chris Rock joke, and like an open-miker."
Iliza Shlesinger,,"This isn’t a bra, it’s body armor. And this isn’t make up, it’s war paint."
Iliza Shlesinger,,Never laugh at your significant other when they're having an orgasm. That is their time to shine.
Iliza Shlesinger,mexicans,"I learned this one growing up in Texas and, subsequently, living in Los Angeles: always use the 'usted' form when speaking to a Spanish official. Mexican border patrol cops don't like it when you call them 'amigo,' give them a hardy pat on the back, slip a $20 in their pocket. No bueno, it doesn't fly. By the way, those of you not laughing at that obviously took French in high school, and that was a gay choice."
J. B. Smoove,,Peeps ask why the shades inside JB? I have a cool prescription thats why!
J. B. Smoove,,Father's Day just be Mother's Day the sequel.
J. B. Smoove,politics,I don't like to dabble in anything I don't do well. I don't talk politics.
J. B. Smoove,,"Just broke up with somebody. Well, it wasn't really a break up, it was a booty call I might have took too serious."
J. B. Smoove,,I did a club one night - the speakers were old as hell. My jokes were coming out in black and white.
J. B. Smoove,,"Sometimes, when you get a girl pregnant, you blame the condom. His condom broke that night."
J. B. Smoove,,"My wife and I have been together for 11 years, and seven of those married. We got married on 07/07/07. We support each other 150 percent. We have fun. We are a modern-day Sonny & Cher. I don’t sing. My wife sings. We’re so different, but so alike. We got that ying and yang thing going on. You see it, but you don’t know how it works."
J. B. Smoove,,"When you're babysitting a kid, all you're seeing is a version of them, a small dosage."
J. B. Smoove,,"You don't want to take the world over with a whole hamper full of dirty clothes. That's the main thing people overlook. And take a shower, take a bath every day."
J. B. Smoove,,"I have my website, The Ruckus, which is an Internet site, similar to the Funny or Die format, where people post funny videos. I get a chance to rate their videos; they get a chance to blog and kick it with me."

J. B. Smoove,,"I'm trying to be the Jay-Z of comedy one day. I don't know if there's any comedy moguls out there, but I would love to be the first comedy mogul."
J. B. Smoove,basketball,"If a director brings a guy to their movie who does improv, they've got to let him do what he does - otherwise it's like bringing Michael Jordan to your basketball team and telling him to just pass the ball and don't shoot."
J. B. Smoove,,Curb Your Enthusiasm set me up so perfectly. That was one of my favorite shows before I got on it. That started a whole different level of a story for me. I didn’t know how to process it until after I got on the show and realized what the purpose of it was.
J. B. Smoove,,"I try to dress smooth, I try to keep my face shaved, I try to keep my head cut. I try to do all the things to keep it smooth going!"

J. B. Smoove,,I love to pitch things that I believe in and products that I love to use.
J. B. Smoove,comedians,"Comedians are therapists. People honestly think we’re doing it for ourselves. No. If we wanted to do stand-up for ourselves, we would perform in front of a mirror and never go to a club. We are giving this away. Some people are going through so much in their lives, they want to hear something else that’s going on in the world and laugh."
J. B. Smoove,,I am the comedy version of ambidextrous. I’m working with my left and right hand. I’m the two-sided coin. I’m all of those metaphors you can think of. I’m the interracial couple. I’m BET and CBS.

J. B. Smoove,,"I'm putting on a suit and tie when I go see ""The Great Gatsby""."
J. B. Smoove,friends,"Sometimes you can make friends, and sometimes you can take friends. Sometimes people want to be friends with you, and you gotta be like, 'Okay, I can deal with this person's personality and be their friend, but not necessarily do I have to change who I am. I'm not gonna change myself to be their friend.'"
J. B. Smoove,,"Improv relies just as much on listening as it does you delivering dialogue. That's the hard for some people. Some people just concentrate on what they're going to say, and they're not listening. You have to listen in order to see where the other person is going to."
J. B. Smoove,"acceptance,friends","I'm, like, everybody's friend. I'm one of those dudes. I can be friends with anybody. Any race of person, any personality, I can kind of deal with them. I accept different types of people."
J. B. Smoove,,"I would only take a role that I know I'm comfortable in and I can do. I've turned down plenty of things because I'd feel it's not me, and I wouldn't want to come on someone's project and flip that."

J. B. Smoove,,Damn! This flight attendant treating us like we won these first class tickets in a contest.
J. B. Smoove,,"My mother is old, but she jokes around. She lives in a senior living home. After a certain age some people don’t like joking. They take her sarcasm the wrong way. I get that from my family. Everybody talks over each other. The first time I took my wife to my family reunion, she said, “I don’t know what’s going on. I can’t do this!”"
J. B. Smoove,,I may even show up behind the camera. I love to put things together; I love to give direction. I have a great eye for pace.

J. B. Smoove,,"I never write jokes, I just try to make myself laugh."
J. B. Smoove,,"I wouldn't want to be someone's roommate, that's for sure. You can't do certain things: you can't leave the bathroom door open... you can't put your feet on the couch, you can't hide stuff in the couch."
J. B. Smoove,,"I tell people all the time, as I was going through my process of being a comedian or being an actor and a writer at 'SNL,' I tell people that everything you do is all a piece of your puzzle to determine where you're going to end up at."
J. B. Smoove,,"I can apply myself to the format of 'SNL,' I can apply myself to the format of 'Conan,' but at the same time, I'm still being J. B. Smoove. I'm not changing up my style, I'm not changing up how I think, what's funny to me, my delivery, the way I carry myself."
J. B. Smoove,,I loved Peter Sellers. I thought he was the perfect mix of physical comedy with out-of-the-box humor. I loved his tone; I loved his physicality; I loved everything about what he was doing as a comedic actor.
J. B. Smoove,talent,"I'm sure back in the Greek days or the Roman Empire days, when guys fought in arenas and were fighting lions, people were talking smack. Every era in history has someone talking smack. No way you can have talent and not proclaim your victory."
J. B. Smoove,,"If your boss asks you why you're comin' in late, you say it's 'cause you stayed late."
J. B. Smoove,,You want your lady to be a contortionist. What man wouldn't want a lady who's a contortionist?

J. B. Smoove,new york,"I'm street smart. You can't con me. But that's just from living in New York. Now if a guy came from Mississippi somewhere, Ohio somewhere, to New York City for the first time, he don't have the street smarts. You can take him."
J. B. Smoove,"attitude,shoes","My father always dressed nice, and he always wore shades and a hat. Plus he always wore shined shoes. He taught me: “Always get there before you get there.” That means always dress nice. Even if you’re not the most handsome man in the world, you must have handsome characteristics, such as a handsome personality and attitude."

J. B. Smoove,"white people,addiction,hockey","I am addicted to hockey now. I've seen it on TV, but to be there? I had no idea that white people were having so much fun without me."
J. B. Smoove,,"When you speak directly at things and don't say you're going to try to do something or that you hope to do something, the universe will work with you. Think about it this way - a boomerang goes out and comes back to you if you throw it. If you throw it out at the universe, it will come back down to you on Earth."
J. B. Smoove,,"I'm big on facial expressions, and I'm big on mannerisms, which I find to be hilarious."
J. B. Smoove,opportunities,"I steal scenes, I steal opportunities. I am the ultimate thief. I got sticky fingers, man. They all call me The Thief."
J. B. Smoove,,"If I had signed my fourth season of SNL, I wouldn’t have ever had the opportunity to do Curb Your Enthusiasm. If my buddy OG Pearson wouldn’t have passed away, I wouldn’t have been in L.A. for his memorial, and I would’ve never auditioned for Curb."
J. B. Smoove,,'The ruckus' is different experiences you go through throughout your life which builds your ruckus points up - your tolerance. You've got to have a high tolerance for dealing with stuff all the time.
J. B. Smoove,,You know what I like? I like classic stuff. I like 'The Andy Griffith Show' - the variety of characters was so amazing to me.
J. B. Smoove,wrestling,"To be a true comic, you have to have a signature move. You ever watch wrestling? And your favorite wrestler has the one move that he always does to finish his opponent off, right? Like when he climbs on the rope, and he always jumps off the top rope and finishes off his opponent - that's what a comic has."
J. B. Smoove,,"I should be European, man. I'm long and lean. I'd look good in a trench coat."
J. B. Smoove,cars,"Let me tell about Tennessee. If your car breaks down in Tennessee, you have just moved to Tennessee."
J. B. Smoove,,Mel Gibson is losing it. I don't know how people still supporting this dude's movies like it's all good. That dude is nuts. All you gotta do is shut him down and don't support any of his movies.
J. B. Smoove,,"It's great when a director like Cameron Crowe can take what you do and fit it into what he's doing. If someone's a fan of you already, they can take what you do and make it work for what they're doing. You don't know their vision, and you're thinking, 'How is this guy going to take what I do and make it work in this movie?'"
J. B. Smoove,,I'm afraid one thing - I don't like heights. Heights bug me out. I'm not cool with heights. I refuse to do a comedy show 12 stories up. I'm fearless about everything else.
J. B. Smoove,driving,"I'll drive down the street, and I'll practice improv. I will sit there at a red light and see two guys talking to each other, and I will just start playing both characters. I can't hear them, but I can see their mouths moving, so I'll just put words in their mouths."
J. B. Smoove,,I just always found it easier to be the same guy onstage as you are offstage.

J. B. Smoove,,All you wanna do in life is do what you do well. That's when you're happiest.
J. B. Smoove,comedians,A lot of comedians are selfish.
J. B. Smoove,,I thought 'Pineapple Express' was hilarious.
J. B. Smoove,,"You can’t take everything that is offered to you. I pass on a lot of stuff, because I truly believe that I will shine better if I could do it 200 percent rather than do it 80 percent and make it so-so."
J. B. Smoove,,"I admire Russell Simmons. He is a successful dude that has done a little bit of everything. He keeps it moving, and he’s still doing things. Larry David is also amazing. He is honest and blunt. A creative genius."
J. B. Smoove,"addiction,corporations,iphone","You buy a new iPhone, a few months later, another new iPhone comes out, and you get online to buy another one. You can't get enough. You are addicted to Apple."
J. B. Smoove,"help,success","When you’re learning, sometimes you make mistakes that help you be successful. It can be, realizing, “Oh, I did this wrong” or “I wasn’t affiliated with the right people.” Those things make you better."
J. B. Smoove,,"That's what I am; I'm a drip. You still get hydrated, you still get your nutrients, just a little at a damn time. "

J. B. Smoove,new york,"I quit my day job the day my daughter was born. I remember flying to Cleveland and hitting a thunderstorm, which caused the plane to lose pressure, and the oxygen masks fell from the ceiling. We felt the plane dropping; the pilot was taking it down to regain cabin pressure. My heart was in my stomach. I found out after landing that her mom was in labor. I did the show and came back to New York. By the time I walked into the hospital, my daughter was being born. She was waiting for me. She’s a sweet daddy’s girl. She’s premed. She has her own pie company. She works for Habitat for Humanity."
J. B. Smoove,,"In my stand-up, I’ve always been loose. If there’s a curtain onstage, I’ll use that in my act. If there’s a door, I’ll use the door. I always like to use everything at my disposal, which makes each show a little different and a little more fun."
J. B. Smoove,brain,"I've had jokes stolen a thousand times. But if you can do it better than me, you can have it. I've had jokes stolen from me in the club when I'm next on stage. And my brain will start to turn, and the gears will start turning, and I'll go onstage and create a whole new bit."
J. B. Smoove,audience,I think comedy evolves constantly. I reinvent myself all the time. I always find a way to entertain myself because I truly believe you have to entertain yourself in order to relate it the right way to your audience.
J. B. Smoove,motivation,You're trying to make someone wet their pants and you're trying to make somebody crap in their pants. That's the motivation of a comic. Who else has that power?
J. B. Smoove,cocaine,"I got the most expensive piece of paper on your wall that don't do shit. I'll tell you what I did with mine: I took it down, I shredded it, I stomped on it, and I shredded it to a nice, fine white powder and I snorted it like cocaine. I packaged the rest and sold it to some white girls."
J. B. Smoove,"acceptance,dreams","Pursuing your dreams involves you accepting where you want to go. Don’t allow anybody else to talk you out of things or discourage you from doing whatever you want to do. You can hold on to your dream and never pursue it or you can start pursuing it. If you can see it, or if you can envision it... it can happen."
J. B. Smoove,,"I've done everything. Selling door-to-door fire extinguishers... In bars, I used to repair those machines that have 10 different buttons on them to spray club soda and seltzer."
J. B. Smoove,,"I’m on my version of the protein diet, but there ain’t no protein in it. It’s a Krispy Kreme doughnut between two Cinnabons. And you soak it overnight in Red Bull. Then you chase it with a Snickers."
J. B. Smoove,restaurants,"This Italian restaurant I'm at is authentic! When they seat you, they give you a mustache."
J. B. Smoove,audience,"When you're on stage performing stand-up, things only happen one time. I've done bits where I improv a joke, and people are dying. The next show, I try to repeat it, I can't do it. Because with the first audience that was our moment. It can't happen the same way again. We were all there: a certain type of people were at that show and we all got it."
J. B. Smoove,brain,"Kids love me. I can bounce back and forth. I can discipline kids, and I can get into the mind of a kid. In my brain, I consider myself the ultimate video game player. The ultimate snack maker."
J. B. Smoove,,"I was a beer boy in a bodega, where I was responsible for keeping the beer cold in the freezer. It was the heyday of Olde English 40 ounces. I also sold fire extinguishers. I used to put my foot in the door when people opened it. I would do a demonstration with newspaper on their dining room table. One time, I had done so many damn demos that my extinguisher didn’t have enough fluid in it after I started the fire. I grabbed the tray, threw it outside in the grass and stomped the fire out. The person was yelling; and I got in my car, leaving all of my equipment, and got the hell up out of there."
J. B. Smoove,challenges,"Believe it or not, I write on stage. I can't write anywhere else; I have to be in a moment. I also have to challenge myself to make something funny out of a premise. I never have my own jokes written. I have to change things as I go along, and I have to entertain myself."
J. B. Smoove,,It's an ongoing joke that a black man is always the first one to get killed in movies.
J. B. Smoove,,"Before I got into stand-up, I used to be a hip-hop dancer in a crew, and my name was J. Smoove, and my partner was J. Groove."
J. B. Smoove,audience,I have to satisfy my audience.
J. B. Smoove,,"There's book smart, there is street smart, there's relationship smart, there's too many different kinds of smarts to know all of them. Everybody doesn't know every kind of smart. There's money smart, there's movie smart, there's computer smart. There's just too many different kinds of smarts for people to know all the smarts."
J. B. Smoove,,"I talked about everything, man. I’ve always written material that everyone can laugh at. I talked about growing up. I did a lot of physical comedy. That was my thing. I was a physical comedian. I did anything and everything from running on a treadmill, I can paint a picture on stage of anything."
J. B. Smoove,,Sad when you spend more time trying to stay alive than living.
J. B. Smoove,,"You have to fail, man, but you cannot allow failure to stop you from doing what you must do. Failing is just as good as succeeding in a lot of ways. It’s how you react to it all. You can react to success the wrong way and be a total failure. Or you can react to losing with your whole heart, learn from it, and be a huge success. In stand-up, I’ve learned to know when I’m burning it up or when I’m being so-so. That’s experience. I learn every single time I’m on a stage."
J. B. Smoove,,"The biggest scam I fell for was college. It got me. 'Cause I swear, in high school I was up $40; now I'm down $60,000. All my friends, 'Hey Nore, what was your major?' Bankruptcy, motherfucker."
J. B. Smoove,,"Police blog or entertainment news, it's just good to see your name in print."
J. B. Smoove,,Some of the best dramatic actors have started in comedy.
J. B. Smoove,audience,"I think what I do in my acting world and what I do in my standup world is bring up a brand that I want to bring across. Once you figure out your brand and what you do, it's kind of easy at that. You end up getting your audience."
J. B. Smoove,,"When I first started doing comedy years ago, I used to be the biggest Michael Richards fan. I used to love this dude. He was on a TV show called 'Fridays,' and man, he was tall and lanky - and I was tall and lanky. I love physical comedy, and he was a physical comedian, and I said, 'Man, I love this guy.'"
J. B. Smoove,success,"Look, anybody can tell a joke, so a lot of a comedian’s success is about energy and engagement. A real comic sells himself first and his joke second. So how do you do that? Get your swagger. Know what you’re doing. Be prepared. Be fresh. Be “on.”"
J. B. Smoove,"white people,complaints,racism","I could never live with you; not 'cause I'm racist or nothing. It's just 'cause as a black man in America, I need to have someone I can come home and complain about white people to. And that just don't work with my white wife."
J. B. Smoove,new york,"I live in New York right now but I'm originally from my daddy's nuts. We all are. Think about, we the lucky ones - we made it. You all are winners. That's the first race you ever won."
J. B. Smoove,,"We came here to pick up chicks, not talk about dicks."
J. B. Smoove,,"I most resemble Benjamin Button. I evolve. I attach myself to the heartbeat of whatever is going on at that particular time, or I just chart a new path."
J. B. Smoove,,It's 113 degrees in Phoenix!  Damn!!! I'm not as hot as I thought I was!
J. B. Smoove,,"No matter what you’re doing in life, listen. Listen, wait, process it, then you open your mouth. Gather the information and then you reply. Anything else, you’re bound to fail. Anything you do, do it like that. When you don’t know how to deal with your lady, take an improv class. You can improv on her birthday. You can improv on your anniversary. You can improv in the bedroom. Can you imagine the skills you would have with your lady if you just listened better? Improv opens doors to everything. It’ll keep you from getting fired. It’ll keep you from getting a ticket. It’ll get you a nice time with your lady. Before you open your mouth, make sure you’ve listened. You can have anything you want in life. "
J. B. Smoove,audience,"Man, you can come see me six or seven times in a row and you’ll never see the same show twice, because I don’t like to be robotic onstage. I like to perform for that particular audience."
J. B. Smoove,comedians,"I don’t consider myself a stand-up comedian. I consider myself a performer; a comic as opposed to stand-up comedian. Stand-up comedians stand there and do their bits; I break every rule in creation. If there’s a rule that can be broken in stand-up, I’ll do it."
J. B. Smoove,,"When it's cold - I'll tell you what happens when it's cold: You get a lot of shit done and you get ladies pregnant. When it's hot, ladies will say, ""You're sweating, get the fuck off of me."" Ladies like doggie style in the summertime. Missionary style is more of a wintertime sexual position. Understand?"
J. B. Smoove,,What happens in improv is you create your own storyline.
J. B. Smoove,"driving,golf","As far as standup, everybody has a vehicle they are driving. If what you do works, it’s like playing golf. If you can master that one swing over and over again, you will be successful. That’s what standup is. You have to have a central move and it has to be yours. You have to own your comedy, own what you do."
J. B. Smoove,decisions,"Keep it real by being straight forward. Don't pull no punches on people. It's better to tell somebody than just lollygag around, letting them think they're living their life the right way. Because some people don't know what the hell they're doing, they don't know if they're living the right way or making the right decisions. Some people don't know that."
J. B. Smoove,audience,Sometimes shit comes out your mouth that you don't expect! All you need is a goddamn witness. An audience is a goddamn witness.
J. B. Smoove,,"You ever taste some damn chicken so horrible, that you wished the chicken would show up at your house and show your lady how to cook him?"

Jack Benny,,"When I give concerts, the tickets sell for five dollars to one hundred dollars, but for my concerts the five-dollar seats are down in front... the further back you go, the more you have to pay.

Jack Benny,,"I must be cheaper now than I was ten years ago in order to get a laugh. It's not funny now if I leave the table and give the waiter a nickel tip, which was a laugh years ago. Today I must maneuver it so that somehow I get the waiter to give me a nickel tip."
Jack Benny,hollywood,There's only five real people in Hollywood. Everyone else is Mel Blanc.

Jackie Mason,girlfriends,"Ladies and gentlemen, you can't please everyone. Take my girlfriend - I think she's the most remarkable woman in the world... That's me... But to my wife..."
Jackie Mason,,"When most people return from Europe, they tell tales of all the sites they saw, the shopping, the entertainment, etc. Jews, on the other hand, return and say ""I had this slice of cake in Austria, let me tell you, I don't know how they make it! It was great!"""

Jackie Mason,,Did you ever hear of a kid playing accountant - even if they wanted to be one?
Jackie Mason,,I don't believe that anybody has come to a conclusion on why something is funny. It's funny because it's ridiculous and it's ridiculous for different reasons at different times.
Jackie Mason,differences,"It is easy to tell the difference between Jews and Gentiles. After the show, all the gentiles are saying 'Have a drink? Want a drink? Let's have a drink!' While all the Jews are saying 'Have you eaten yet? Want a piece of cake? Let's have some cake!'"

Jackie Mason,,Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe.
Jackie Mason,hitler,"I've never heard of an Israeli going out as a suicide bombers to kill Palestinians. I never saw anybody offer more peace to the Palestinians. Palestinians, many of them that are our enemies, we still invite them to live in our own country, endangering our own lives to give them equal pay on equal jobs and health care benefits and all kinds of benefits. When an Arab is hurt, even trying to kill us, we give them the best hospitals, the best medical care. We make them partners in our own Parliament, and we're persecuting them? This is such a sick perversion. It's like saying the Jews persecuted Hitler."
Jackie Mason,"money,love,importance","Money is not the most important thing in the world. Love is. Fortunately, I love money."

Jackie Mason,"jail,prostitutes,new york","Prostitutes go to jail. Their customers go home and read the New York Times. In this country you're allowed to buy anything. If you need a shirt, you have a right to buy it. If you need sex, you don't. What's more important, sex or a shirt?"

Jackie Mason,"money,health","My grandfather always said, ""Don't watch your money, watch your health."" So one day while I was watching my health, someone stole my money. It was my grandfather."
Jackie Mason,,"Here's another one about an unlucky purse snatcher. In the middle of last year, I heard a story about a purse snatcher (in England, I believe) who snatched a woman's purse. Much to his surprise and dismay, he found an arm attached to it after he'd grabbed it. It seems that the woman had a prosthetic arm, and he picked the right (or wrong) arm. Apparently, the guy babbled for quite a while, and the woman called the police, and they picked him up, still babbling."

Jackie Mason,,It is more profitable for your congressman to support the tobacco industry than your life.
Jackie Mason,,"The fellow robbed something like a supermarket of about $5000 (value approximate and probably wrong, since it is from fuzzy memory). The local newspaper ran the story, but with the amount given as $7000. The thief called the newspaper to complain about the inaccuracy and to suggest that maybe the store manager ripped off the extra $2000 and was unjustly blaming the thief. The people at the newspaper kept him busy on the phone giving his version of the story while the police traced the call to a phone booth and arrived to arrest him while he was still talking to the newspaper!"
Jackie Mason,,"I'm crazy about the fact that the Jewish people should survive because they have so much to contribute and so many values to contribute to the world. It would be a much better world, a much more peaceful and non-violent world if we lived by Jewish values."

Jackie Mason,money,I have enough money to last me the rest of my life unless I buy something.
Jackie Mason,"questions,acceptance,dancing,dancing","'What is the meaning of life?' is a stupid question. Life just exists. You say to yourself, 'I can't accept that I mean nothing so I have to find the meaning of life so that I shouldn't mean as little as I know I do.' Subconsciously you know you're full of shit. I see life as a dance. Does a dance have to have a meaning? You're dancing because you enjoy it."

Jackie Mason,football,"They call it football, but the object of the game is to bash the other guy so hard that he's eventually carried off the field on a stretcher. I can't watch football anymore. My psychiatrist said it's better that way. I used to watch a game, see the players in a huddle - and think they were talking about me."
Jackie Mason,bible,"Why is it that they have Bibles in every motel room? Why should a man want to read the Bible when he's with a woman alone in a motel room? Why would he be interested? Whatever he's praying for, he's already got!"
Jackie Mason,army,"I'm still suffering from shock from the last war. I was almost drafted! Luckily I was wounded while taking the physical. When I reached the psychiatrist, I said, ""Give me a gun, I'll wipe out the whole German Army in five minutes."" He said, ""You're crazy!"" I said, ""Write it down!"""
Jackie Mason,audience,"I am excited about getting back to what I do best and what my audience likes best, I am writing new jokes every day and soon Ill be telling them every night. Just me, one Jew talking and that's it."

Jackie Mason,basketball,"Blacks can get into medical school with a lower grade. If that's true, a Jew should be able to play basketball with a lower net."
Jackie Mason,business,"The nervousness never lasted more than a second because he was so congenial and comfortable. He made more stars on his show, probably, than anybody in the whole history of show business."
Jackie Mason,"politics,future",I've been watching politics for 35 or 40 years and you just never know. You can have one person win the Iowa caucus and then the whole picture changes ten minutes later. The same thing can happen again after New Hampshire. I have no idea what's going to happen with our country in the future.
Jackie Mason,bible,Everybody knows we're entitled to one Jerusalem. History reveals very simply that this is our land from the days of the Bible.
Janeane Garofalo,,"The camera adds ten pounds. Why? What, we don't have the technology to remedy that one little thing? We can have fucking Forrest Gump cohorting with John F. Kennedy, and we can't just fix that one little thing, the ten pound variant on a lens... You can actually levitate now when you watch a movie about flying, but they just don't have the technology for that ten pound margin of error."
Janeane Garofalo,,It is not crazy to think that powerful people do some pretty horrible things. And maybe they get out of hand. Maybe it just gets away from them. It snowballs.
Janeane Garofalo,,Anybody who French bashes just might as well wear a badge that says 'I am a follower! I don't think for myself and I have no idea what I'm talking about.' That would be a French basher.

Janeane Garofalo,dogs,"All roads lead to my dogs, don't they?"
Janeane Garofalo,,There's always that great photo of the actress or model lifting up her shirt just to show you the bone structure and the six-pack of her own. It's almost like when horses are auctioned and they show you their teeth. 'Am I good enough?'
Janeane Garofalo,,"Granted, not really a joke, but how often do you get a mic in your hand? You know? So. I am sorry but don't anybody trip on my soap box on the way out. Don't anybody trip over that. And the chip on my shoulder's a little heavy. I have back problems now."
Janeane Garofalo,,"No no no! Don't clap! No no no, you make me seem like I'm like a prophet or something and I'm so not!"
Janeane Garofalo,,"But the only ramifications were, like, the kind of bigoted right-wing assault and pretend anger, partisan anger, that came from some right-wing radio people or the pretend anger from guys like Scarborough and nonsense like that."
Janeane Garofalo,,"The notebook. Yes, as you know Garofalo's a little forgetful. Has to bring her notebook. Between the Nutrasweet and the Fen-phen, I don't know whether to shit or wind my watch at this point. I gotta have a thing happening here because I don't wanna forget what I wanna discuss with you. I owe you that much."

Janeane Garofalo,,This dress exacerbates the genetic betrayal that is my legacy.
Janeane Garofalo,,I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things. The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And I just cut my lip on it. And chipped a tooth.
Janeane Garofalo,,I don't have a good work ethic. I have a real casual relationship with hours.
Janeane Garofalo,future,"I think that by staying out of shape at the age of 33 I'm doing myself a huge favor for my future. There will never be anyone commenting on how I've 'let myself go.' I've gone. It's gone. It's not going, it's gone."
Janeane Garofalo,philosophy,"I would say that, unfortunately, the word liberal has been redefined over the last 30 years as if it is a bad thing. But liberalism is a great American philosophy. Being a liberal is one of the best things you can be. I don’t think they get a fair shake at all in the conservative mainstream media. So maybe there’s some intimidation there."
Janeane Garofalo,,I don't know that I would need to be famous as a Middle East policy expert to see that unilateral imperialism is bad policy.
Janeane Garofalo,,"He said that faith is like a glass of water. When you're young, the glass is small, and it's easy to fill up. But the older you get, the bigger the glass gets, and the same amount of liquid doesn't fill it anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be refilled."
Janeane Garofalo,,"If you don't do any self-examinations or see a doctor ever, you'll live forever. That's how you do it. The diagnosis is what gets you. You just have a don't ask, don't tell policy with any and all bodily functions."

Janeane Garofalo,,"A lot of the hate mail I get is clearly misogynist. I am a proud liberal, feminist woman, and the hate mail I get about those three things is not about me. It's about those signifers, and about what the right in this country has managed to do to perpetuate anger over what they mean."
Janeane Garofalo,,Without liberals we wouldn't have unions. We wouldn't have environmental protections. We wouldn't have seat belts or birth control or the ACLU! Any of these things!
Janeane Garofalo,,What has Iraq done to us?
Janeane Garofalo,hollywood,"Well I don't know what the city of Hollywood knows about foreign policy, but do I know that a lot of people do learn and educate themselves about policy and I don't have to be a policy expert to know that this will be a disaster."
Janeane Garofalo,terrorists,"You just did a whole read-through. The lie that brought us into war was that Iraq was a threat to us. Well, now it is a threat. Now it is a terrorist hotbed. The fiction is now reality. And now we have to deal with it. It was an attempt at a corporate takeover. This was about oil. It wasn't about human rights. It's not about human rights."
Janeane Garofalo,,There's nothing wrong with the word conspiracy. It just means 'to breathe together'.
Janeane Garofalo,corporations,"To a right-winger, unions are awful. Why do right-wingers hate unions? Because collective bargaining is the power that a worker has against the corporation. Right-wingers hate that."
Janeane Garofalo,,"Nationalism and patriotism in the wrong hands will destroy lives, it really will, because I'll tell you something: it takes a village to ruin a child. I think we've proven that time and time again in this country."
Janeane Garofalo,,"You know what is good about these Dixie Chicks burnings or bashings? It's a wonderful, wonderful way for really stupid people to hook up. They meet, they throw some things on the fire, they talk about Vin Diesel, they tell stories about who their favorite Fox anchor is, they exchange phone numbers and in some cases has led to marriages."
Janeane Garofalo,,"I'm not religious anymore, but I think it's like papal infallibility, which is a ridiculous man-made tenet, like what I believe most religious tenets to be, are man-made after the fact."

Janeane Garofalo,celebrities,I absolutely realize that a celebrity spokesperson is not ideal.
Janeane Garofalo,,"You know George W. Bush is a war-time president, he says – proudly. Guess what. War is failure! When you are at war, you have failed! When you have gone to a war of choice and lied about it, you're a double-triple, triple-quadruple failure! Or a warlord. It's called a warlord in other countries. A war time president here. One man's ceiling I guess is another man's floor. George Bush is a warlord. He's a failure!"
Janeane Garofalo,,It sounds like I'm always being facetious. That's why I never get voice over work. 'You sound like you hate the product.'
Janeane Garofalo,,"But let me ask you this though, first and foremost: who's your favorite Spice Girl? Mine is Sporty Spice and I'll tell you why. You know what? She might not be as aesthetically pleasant as the rest but she'll do a backflip and steal your heart."
Janeane Garofalo,,"I can't wait for the next fad though, and I predict it's going to be Pennsylvania dutch culture, very Amish. It's going to be bonnets and butter churns."

Janeane Garofalo,,"You have to have a lot more dedication to what I'll call 'the machine,' ... I have 20 percent dedication. What's needed is 110 percent. You can't have it with the level of apathy I have."
Janeane Garofalo,"opportunities,hollywood","I don't think Hollywood was trying to do anything with me. In fact, they lost interest pretty quick.

Janeane Garofalo,,A war is going to destroy our economy even further. It's going to be a threefold humanitarian disaster.
Janeane Garofalo,"driving,california","Pedestrian's rights - because we live in California, I've got to address this issue. I don't know where on the fence I am about that. I suppose if I'm walking, I'm all for it, but if I'm driving, that's a whole other can of worms."
Janeane Garofalo,,Is being an idiot like being high all the time?
Janeane Garofalo,,"It's mentally exhausting, feeling bad about something you can do nothing about."
Janeane Garofalo,audience,"I was a 36C or D, and at 5' 1'', I knew that being a small person with big boobs standing in front of an audience was not going to be easy. It would be really hard to get people to pay attention to me without mocking me. Getting a breast reduction to prepare for my career was no different from people who work to get good grades to get into a good college to get into a good graduate school to get a good job. I went down to a B cup, and it was the best thing in the whole world."
Janeane Garofalo,,"Taking into account the public's regrettable lack of taste, it is incumbent upon you not to fit in."
Janeane Garofalo,,"Tina Fey is part of a generation of women who have changed the face of comedy at 'Second City,' 'SNL,' in sitcoms and in film."
Janeane Garofalo,new york,"Our country is founded on a sham: our forefathers were slave-owning rich white guys who wanted it their way. So when I see the American flag, I go, ""Oh my God, you're insulting me."" That you can have a gay parade on Christopher Street in New York, with naked men and women on a float cheering, 'We're here, we're queer!"" - that's what makes my heart swell. Not the flag, but a gay naked man or woman burning the flag. I get choked up with pride."
Janeane Garofalo,,"I got mugged. And they got my knapsack with my comedy notebook in it. So if anybody see two cholos bombing at the Funny Bone chain, that would be them. Just give me a jingle."
Janeane Garofalo,bible,"The Bible, I've said it before, is a beautifully written work of fiction."
Janeane Garofalo,,"Last night, I went to a birthday party, and this girl brought a cake and a cheesecake. And the other girls that lived in the apartment, I swear to God, all night long: 'You're taking that cake with you when you go. That cake's not staying in this house.' Like it's this evil, Hope Diamond, nuclear, horrifying cursed thing."
Janeane Garofalo,questions,"Listening to your tape, I was reminded of this poem. It has the central question: Is it harder to count on someone or to know that you're being the one counted upon?

Janeane Garofalo,rage,"They have these runway shows and then they have a commentator going, ""A return to glamor this season. A pretty face is your best asset this season."" As opposed to last season. When ugly girls had a free ride. When back fat was all the rage."
Janeane Garofalo,,"There's been times when I have actually had sex indoors. And then you kind of sober up a little when it's over. I become like a bartender at 2 AM. ""OK, people, let's move it out! Yeah, you don't have to go home but you can’t stay here."""

Janeane Garofalo,"democracy,honesty,racism,white house,tea","Let's be very honest about what this is about. It's not about bashing Democrats, it's not about taxes, they have no idea what the Boston tea party was about, they don't know their history at all. This is about hating a black man in the White House. This is racism straight up."
Janeane Garofalo,acceptance,"Many people feel that mass acceptance and smooth socialization are desirable life paths for a young adult... Many people are often wrong... Don't bother being nice. Being popular and well liked is not in your best interest. Let me be more clear; if you behave in a manner pleasing to most, then you are probably doing something wrong. The masses have never been arbiters of the sublime, and they often fail to recognize the truly great individual. Taking into account the public's regrettable lack of taste, it is incumbent upon you not to fit in."

Janeane Garofalo,,"This world is bullshit. And just because I appear in music video wherein I am in my underwear, and make young women feel not good enough so that they become anorxeic; and okay, maybe because of that I became popular more quickly than other singers who are, I don't know, maybe more talented or better songwriters. That doesn't matter because, and... um... my boyfriend is a magician, and he can pull a quarter out of your ear and say things like 'We have not met before have we?' Go with yourself."

Janeane Garofalo,,"Dog Park was a blast. I love Bruce McCulloch. That was a case of the studio taking the cut away from the director, and it went from being a great movie to a shitty movie. Bruce's original cut that I saw was hilarious."

No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we areto the bitter end.

Jerry Seinfeld,,"The luge is the only Olympic event where you could have people competing in it against their will, and it would look exactly the same.

World record. Didn't even wanna do it. I'd like to see that next Olympics, the Involuntary Luge."
Jerry Seinfeld,,"The Olympics is really my favorite sporting event. Although, I think I have a problem with that silver medal. Because when you think about it, you win the gold - you feel good, you win the bronze - you think, ""Well, at least I got something"". But when you win that silver it's like, ""Congratulations, you almost won. Of all the losers you came in first of that group. You're the number one loser. No one lost ahead of you!"" "
Jerry Seinfeld,,"I will never understand why they cook on TV. I can't smell it. Can't eat it. Can't taste it. The end of the show they hold it up to the camera, ""Well, here it is. You can't have any. Thanks for watching. Goodbye."""
Jerry Seinfeld,,"I had a parakeet that used to fly around the house and crash into these huge mirrors my mother put in.

Jerry Seinfeld,dogs,"A dog will stay stupid. That's why we love them so much. The entire time we know them, they're idiots. Think of your dog. Every time you come home, he thinks it's amazing. He has no idea how you accomplish this every day. You walk in the door; the joy of this experience overwhelms him. He looks at you, ""He's back. It's that guy, that same guy."" He can't believe it. Everything is amazing to your dog. ""Another can of food? I don't believe it."""
Jerry Seinfeld,,"Cremation has become the most popular form of burial in the United States... People used to want a big, thick granite stone, their names carved into with a chisel.

Jerry Seinfeld,,"I was the best man to a wedding one time, that was pretty good. Pretty good title, I thought, best man. I thought it was a bit much. I thought we'd have the groom and a pretty good man. That's more than enough. If I'm the best man, why is she marrying him?"
Jerry Seinfeld,,"The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all the same; so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is like the joining together of a beautiful, glowing bride and some guy. The tuxedo is a wedding safety device, created by women because they know that men are undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes one step over, and she marries the next guy."

Jerry Seinfeld,freud,"You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man.

By which I mean it came a little sooner than people were expecting...was such a wonderful experience for me. It wasn't even the thing I thought I was going to have a talent for. I just fell in with the perfect group of people and everything about it was sort of miraculous."
Jerry Seinfeld,embarrassment,"Are there keys to a plane? Maybe that's what those delays are sometimes, when you're just sitting there at the gate. Maybe the pilot sits up there in the cockpit going, ""Oh, I don't believe this. Dammit... I did it again."" They tell you it's something mechanical because they don't want to come on the P. A. system, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a while. I uh... Oh, God this is so embarrassing... I, I left the keys to the plane in my apartment. They're in this big ashtray by the front door. I'm sorry, I'll run back and get them."""

When it's raining, do cows go up to the farmhouse, ""Let us in! We're all wearing leather! Open the door! We're going to ruin the whole outfit here!"""

You do whatever you have to do, and we'll do whatever we have to. ...To a man, sex is like a car accident anyway, and trying to determine a female orgasm is like asking, ""What did you see after the car went out of control?"" ""Well, there were a lot of screeching noises, I was facing the wrong way at one point, and in the end, my body was thrown clear."""
Jerry Seinfeld,,"To me, a lawyer is basically the person that knows the rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our pieces around the board, but if there is a problem the lawyer is the only person who has read the inside of the top of the box."
Jerry Seinfeld,,"Why is McDonalds still counting? How insecure is this company? 40 million, 80 billion million jillion killion tillion... who cares? Is anyone really impressed by that any more?

Jim Carrey,,"I don't think you can know God unless you're passionate about him so you're either screaming at him, enraptured with the idea of being around him or feeling him in your life."
Jim Carrey,,Either you're the one erasing or you're the one being erased.

Jim Carrey,love,I really want to love somebody. I do. I just don't know if it's possible forever and ever.
Jim Carrey,"parents,stupidity",I got a lot of support from my parents. That's the one thing I always appreciated. They didn't tell me I was being stupid; they told me I was being funny.
Jim Carrey,,"I refuse to feel guilty. I feel guilty about too much in my life but not about money. I went through periods when I had nothing, so somebody in my family has to get stinkin' wealthy."

Jim Carrey,"people,pain,life,problems","Most of the time I live with my pain. I have pain but I won't show it around. I think that's the nobility of the character. There's something noble in not spewing on people all the time about your problems. I'm the light guy, so I identified."

Jim Carrey,life,Those times in life when you're terrified are the mastery times.
Jim Carrey,life,"I don't think anybody should go through life without a team of psychologists. I have been through times when I'm literally squatting in the living room, having one of those open-throated cries, where you're crying all the way to your butthole. I always believed I would come out of it, though."
Jim Carrey,,We had problems like all families but we had a lot of love. I was extremely loved. We always felt we had each other.
Jim Carrey,,"For some reason I did something where I realized I could get a reaction.

Jim Carrey,,"I've arrived at the place if I'm not taking a career risk, I'm not happy. If I'm scared, then I know I'm being challenged."
Jim Carrey,,"Life is an ordeal, albeit an exciting one, but I wouldn't trade it for the good old days of poverty and obscurity."

Jim Carrey,,I absolutely want to have a career where you make'em laugh and make'em cry. It's all theater.
Jim Carrey,,"There's new territory, there's new places to go, new things to explore. Why stay back there? Maybe it will take three films to find another character that is really totally original, but I've got a lifetime, so why waste it just repeating myself."
Jim Carrey,,"I'm the first to admit this whole salary thing is getting out of control. In the final analysis, it's still about the work."
Jim Carrey,danger,"The money can be a hindrance to someone like me because the danger is that you start thinking, ""Is that a $20 million take?"" That kind of thing, and being self-critical."
Jim Carrey,,"Here it goes: I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit a Chevy, I sped some more, I failed to yeild at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I changed lanes without signaling while running a red light and speeding!"
Jim Carrey,,A lot of good love can happen in ten years.
Jim Carrey,,"Price check on Vagiclean, aisle five. I repeat: price check on Vagiclean, aisle five. That's Vagiclean. We've got a customer down here with a full-on fallopian fungus. She's baking a loaf of bread and I think it's sourdough."
Jim Carrey,brain,"Come back here, so that I may brain thee!"
Jim Carrey,,"Wake up, little snoozy. Smell the smelling salts? Ha ha ha. I'll juice ya up."

Jim Carrey,,What are you waiting for? An engraved invitation?
Jim Carrey,money,"That's the trouble with being me. At this point, nobody gives a damn what my problem is. I could literally have a tumor on the side of my head and they'd be like, ""Yeah, big deal. I'd eat a tumor every morning for the kinda money you're pulling down."""
Jim Carrey,,"I used to draw a lot. If my mother would ask me to do something else, I'd have a hairy conniption. I'd just go crazy."
Jim Carrey,respect,"I need privacy. I would think that because what I do makes a lot of people happy that I might deserve a little bit of respect in return. Instead, the papers try to drag me off my pedestal."
Jim Carrey,,I'm a hard guy to live with. I'm like a caged animal. I'm up all night walking around the living room. It's hard for me to come down from what I do.
Jim Carrey,"society,inspiration","Before I do anything, I think, well what hasn't been seen. Sometimes, that turns out to be something ghastly and not fit for society. And sometimes that inspiration becomes something that's really worthwhile."
Jim Carrey,,"There was a time when people said, ""Jim, if you keep on making faces, your face will freeze like that."" Now they just say, ""Pay him!"""

Jim Carrey,,"But, you know, you can't be a star at home."
Jim Carrey,,"I want to be the greatest actor that ever lived, frankly. I'd love that. But I don't need to be. I just want to be here. That's it."
Jim Carrey,"importance,comedians",Originality is really important.
Jim Carrey,,"I haven't been as wild with my money as somebody like me might have been. I've been very safe, very conservative with investments. I don't blow money. I don't have a ton of houses. I know things can go away. I've already had that experience."

Joan Rivers,,I finally found out how priests get holy water. They boil the hell out of it.
Joan Rivers,,"Welcome to my world! I've been through it all, and I often pinch myself to believe my luck. I design jewlery, create cosmetics, perform comedy, act, lecture, write books, travel, have a fabulous daughter, and a phenomenal grandson-and I feel I'm the luckiest woman on the planet."
Joan Rivers,,Looking fifty is great - if you're sixty.
Joan Rivers,husband,"I don't think I'm good in bed. My husband never said anything, but after we made love he'd take a piece of chalk and outline my body."
Joan Rivers,,Grandchildren can be fucking annoying. How many times can you go 'And the cow goes moo and the pig goes oink'? It's like talking to a supermodel.

Joan Rivers,,Elizabeth Taylor has more chins than the Chinese telephone directory.
Joan Rivers,,"Because I'm the only performer who comes out and says I've had plastic surgery, I've become the plastic surgery poster girl, which is hilarious, because everybody has done it and they all deny it. They stand there, like the Bride of Frankenstein, they've all got stitches, and they all say, 'I've done nothing.' I talk about it."
Joan Rivers,worth,"I tried to contact Johnny to reconcile our friendship, a million times, but he just wasn't having it. When he passed away, I felt such a crushing blow, that things were still unresolved. Johnny was a dear friend, I wish things would've ended different, this just was not worth it."
Joan Rivers,,"Victoria Beckham should get a life, I am not a fan of outrageous consumption. I think it is vulgar. And no-one should flaunt that they have a hundred Hermes $12,000 bags. Not when people are starving. Everyone should be allowed to have a great time but she shows a distinct lack of class."
Joan Rivers,,"The average airplane is 16 years old, and so is the average airplane meal."
Joan Rivers,,"If you're going to be a romantic idol and try to get every teenage girl to love you, then you'd be an ass to come out and say you're gay. Ricky Martin was so smart. He did what he did, made his millions and then he said, Guess what, every body? I'm gay... It didn't matter anymore because he didn't have to bring in 16-year-old girls."
Joan Rivers,,"Both of my parents got to see me host Carson, thank God. That's all anyone wants: to have their parents see they're going to be all right in life."

Joan Rivers,babies,"And since we’re all adults here, let’s be brutally honest – most babies are not actually attractive. In fact, they’re weird and freakish looking.

Joan Rivers,,"I'm in nobody's circle, I've always been an outsider."

Joan Rivers,hate,"I hate the term 'partner.' 'Yes, we're partners... This is my life partner, Teddy.' Jacoby & Meyers are partners. Ben & Jerry are partners. Bausch + Lomb are partners. You and Teddy are fuck-buddies."
Joan Rivers,,I spit on education. No man will ever put his hand up your dress looking for a library card.
Joan Rivers,,"Life is very tough. If you don't laugh, it's tough."

Joan Rivers,,"I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them."
Joan Rivers,acceptance,I have no methods; all I do is accept people as they are.
Joan Rivers,"husband,pain",Before we make love my husband takes a pain killer.
Joan Rivers,,"The first time I see a jogger smiling, I'll consider it."
Joan Rivers,,"I told my mother-in-law that my house was her house, and she said, 'Get the hell off my property.'"

Joan Rivers,hollywood,"Remember a few years ago when they left Bea Arthur out of the death reel at the Oscars? Bea Arthur! How did they leave Bea Arthur out?

Joan Rivers,friends,All my friends are dying. That's why I always wear black.
Joan Rivers,"husband,sex","I have no sex appeal, which kills me. The only way I can ever hear heavy breathing from my husband's side of the bed is when he's having an asthma attack."
Joan Rivers,,"No steam or gas ever drives anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled. No life ever grows until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined."

Joan Rivers,"babies,toasters",I knew I was an unwanted baby when I saw that my bath toys were a toaster and a radio.
Joan Rivers,airports,"Victoria Beckham is so nasty, why doesn't she just go home?! Her dresses are beautiful, but I don't care what she does. She's mean to all the people around her. She's too short to be a diva. We all use the same hairdressers, make-up artists, limo-drivers and greeters at the airports in LA and nobody has anything nice to say about her. They say she's rude. She can't always just be having a bad day."
Joan Rivers,"men,sex","The nice thing about Viagra is that they are proving men can go blind on it, so you can gain weight and have a great sex life."
Joan Rivers,work,You know you're getting old when work is a lot less fun and fun is a lot more work.
Joan Rivers,,"Every woman in this room tonight: Think like a second wife. You grab and you take. You grab and you take. And when you die, whatever you got out of him you have buried on you. If the next bitch wants it, make her dig for it."

Joan Rivers,"money,people,happiness","People say that money is not the key to happiness, but I always figured if you have enough money, you can have a key made."
Joan Rivers,questions,"A man can sleep around, no questions asked, but if a woman makes nineteen or twenty mistakes she's a tramp."
Joan Rivers,dogs,My obstetrician was so dumb that when I gave birth he forgot to cut the cord. For a year that kid followed me everywhere. It was like having a dog on a leash.

Joan Rivers,dogs,"If I found her floating in my pool, I'd punish my dog."
Joan Rivers,"hate,shoes,hollywood","I've always hate child stars, starting from way back when, when I was a child. The first child star I saw was Shirley Temple. She was six years old, two foot six and the biggest star in Hollywood. She wore ribbons in her hair, and frilly little pinafores and shiny patent-leather tap shoes - just like the boys in Glee do."
Joan Rivers,,"I was so ugly that they sent my picture to Ripley's 'Believe It or Not' and he sent it back and said, 'I don't believe it.'"
Joan Rivers,,I had a Jewish delivery; they knock you out with the first pain; they wake you up when the hairdresser shows.
Joan Rivers,,"I'm going out with these old guys. One guy gave me a hickey and left his teeth in my neck. Another man, we were having a perfectly lovely dinner; he looked up and me and went: ""You're not my wife!"" Another guy died during dinner.

Joan Rivers,,Mick Jagger could French-kiss a moose. He has child-bearing lips.
Joan Rivers,,"I have become my own version of an optimist. If I can't make it through one door, I'll go through another door - or I'll make a door. Something terrific will come no matter how dark the present."
Joan Rivers,lady gaga,"How stupid can you get? Christina must have been thinking about food, thats why she forgot the words. Shes gotten so big. She looks like she could eat Lady GaGa. Great way to get rid of competition."
Joan Rivers,"friends,new york","Sold my house in LA, packed myself up and moved to New York, not knowing anybody. Friends are very hard to make after a certain age."

Joan Rivers,,"Forty for you, sixty for me. And equal partners we will be."
Joan Rivers,,"I hate Tom Cruise... In TV interviews Tom laughs inappropriately and much too vociferously at non-humorous declarative statements, which is ironic because in real life he can’t take a fucking joke at all. All you have to do is make one simple, little, harmless, innocuous aside like, 'The Scientology spaceship was late today; it had to stop by Fire Island to pick up Tom Cruise,' and he has a pack of lawyers at your door faster than Katie Holmes can say, 'No, really, he loves me in that way, I swear.'"
Joan Rivers,,"Don't follow any advice, no matter how good, until you feel as deeply in your spirit as you think in your mind that the counsel is wise."
Joan Rivers,,You know you're getting old when you buy a sexy sheer nightgown and don't know anyone who can see through it.
Joan Rivers,,"""Where there is a will there is a way"" is an old true saying. He who resolves upon doing a thing, by that very resolution often scales the barriers to it, and secures its achievement. To think we are able, is almost to be so - to determine upon attainment is frequently attainment itself."
Joan Rivers,parents,My earliest childhood memory was watching my parents loosen the wheels on my stoller.
Joan Rivers,men,"Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I believe when a woman enters a room, men should stand up - and gay men should stand up at least halfway."

Joan Rivers,,"She loves me so much, my daughter. She doesn't want me to be lonely; isn't that nice? She's trying to fix me up with Robert Blake."
Joan Rivers,"age,doctors","You know you've reached middle age when you're cautioned to slow down by your doctor, instead of by the police."

Joan Rivers,,Having my daughter I screamed for twenty-three hours straight. And that was just during conception.
Joan Rivers,,"I want them to know I don't think I'm wonderful, or better than they are. Part of comedy is saying: 'I am you and you are me, and we're all feeling the same thing.'"
Joan Rivers,,I like colonic irrigation because sometimes you find old jewellery.
Joan Rivers,husband,"I said to my husband, my boobs have gone, my stomach's gone, say something nice about my legs. He said, ""Blue goes with everything."""

Joan Rivers,experience,"Anger is a symptom, a way of cloaking and expressing feelings too awful to experience directly - hurt, bitterness, grief, and, most of all, fear."

Joan Rivers,"husband,sex",I blame my mother for my poor sex life. All she told me was 'the man goes on top and the woman underneath.' For three years my husband and I slept in bunk beds.
Joan Rivers,heaven,"For as one star another far exceeds, so souls in heaven are placed by their deeds."
Joan Rivers,husband,"I said to my husband, ""Why don't you call out my name when we're making love?"" He said, ""I don't want to wake you up."""

Joan Rivers,,My boobs are so low I had to put curb feelers on my nipples!
Joan Rivers,gays,"The only street I like is Rue Honore de Balzac, because 'Balzac' sound so gay, and I love my gays. I might like Parisians more if they named their streets only for gay icons, like Rue Liza Minnelli or Rue Bette Midler or, my favorite, Rue McClanahan."
Joan Rivers,"laws,parents","I love gay and lesbian parents. But I think we need a law that says lesbians and gay men have to raise their children together. This way, the kids would not only know how to build bookshelves, but they'd also instinctively know how to decorate them."
Joan Rivers,death,Does fashion matter? Always - though not quite as much after death.
Joan Rivers,celebrities,"Everyone thinks Angelina Jolie was the first celebrity baby hoarder, but she wasn't. Before Angelina there was Mia Farrow. Mia had an entire farm full of children. I think she got them at Costco."
Joan Rivers,gays,"Gay marriage - I am so against it because all my gay friends are out. And if they get married, it will cost me a fortune in gifts."
Joan Rivers,"parents,abortion","My parents just didn't like me. Till I was 9, my mother was trying to get an abortion. That sticks with you. That hurts. She said to her doctor, 'Is there any possible way to get rid of this thing?'"

Joan Rivers,friends,"She's so fat, she's my two best friends."

Joey Bishop,,"The president of a TV network generously agreed to take his company's aptitude test, a test required of all the personnel. He did badly. As a result he was in a sullen mood for the rest of the day. When he got home that night, his wife asked why he looked so grouchy. ""I took the company's aptitude test this morning."" ""What did it show?"" asked the wife. ""It showed,"" boomed the executive, ""that such tests are idiotic. That's what it showed."""
Joey Bishop,,Last week I gave Dean Martin a cigarette lighter. He finished it in one gulp.
Joey Bishop,,"The other day I drove home filled with pride and a sense of achievement. I entered the house, and there was my mother. ""Mama,"" I said proudly, ""I have a new Corvette outside."" Mama looked at me, shook her head and said sadly: ""Please, Joey. Don't bring her in."""
Joey Bishop,,"My doctor is wonderful. Once, in 1955, when I couldn't afford an operation, he touched up the X-rays."
Joey Bishop,,The kick of comedy is to think quickly. It's a great kick.
Joey Bishop,hollywood,"You know how Van Nuys got its name? Well, one day my little old Jewish mother was visiting me, and I took her to the top of the Hollywood Hills and had her view the valley below just at sunset. ""Well, mama, what would you call that?"" And she said, ""Ver nize."""
Joey Bishop,"worth,nowdays",Today you can go to a gas station and find the cash register open and the toilets locked. They must think toilet paper is worth more than money.
Joey Bishop,chicago,"I love Chicago. I got on a bus and asked the driver, ""Do you go to the Loop?"" He said, ""No, I go beep-beep!"""
Joey Bishop,,The other day I started to take a course in psycho-ceramics. What is psycho-ceramics? It's the study of crackpots.
Joey Bishop,success,"I don't consider success doing a show for 30 years; I'm sorry. To me, you're successful when you graduate from something. I did a series, I did a talk show, I did movies, I replaced Mickey Rooney on Broadway in ""Sugar Babies."" You understand?"
Joey Bishop,,"I once called my mother during a hurricane. She got on the phone and said, ""I can't talk to you, Joey, the lines are down."""
Joey Bishop,,"A salesman called on my wife the other day and tried to sell her a freezer. ""You'll save a fortune on your food bills,"" he promised. ""I can't tell you how much you'll save. It'll be tremendous."" Said my wife: ""I'm sure you're right, but we're already saving a fortune with our new car by not taking the bus. We're saving a fortune with our new washing machine by not sending out the laundry. We're saving a fortune with our new dishwasher by giving up the maid. The plain truth is that right now we just can't afford to save any more!"""

Johnny Carson,money,The only thing money gives you is the freedom of not worrying about money.
Johnny Carson,"husband,differences,divorce",The difference between a divorce and a legal separation is that a legal separation gives a husband time to hide his money.

Johnny Carson,,"I hated my last boss. He asked, ""Why are you two hours late?"" I said, ""I fell downstairs."" He said, ""That doesn't take two hours."""
Johnny Carson,"happiness,vacation",Happiness is sitting down to watch slides of your neighbor's vacation and finding out he spent two weeks at a nudist colony.
Johnny Carson,,"If variety is the spice of life, marriage is the big can of leftover Spam."
Johnny Carson,,I was so naive as a kid I used to sneak behind the barn and do nothing.
Johnny Carson,"television,democracy","Democracy means free television, not good television, but free."
Johnny Carson,gifts,"The worst gift is a fruitcake. There is only one fruitcake in the entire world, and people keep sending it to each other."
Johnny Carson,democracy,"Democracy is the eagle on the back of a dollar bill, with 13 arrows in one claw, 13 leaves on a branch, 13 tail feathers, and 13 stars over its head - this signifies that when the white man came to this country, it was bad luck for the Indians, bad luck for the trees, bad luck for the wildlife, and lights out for the American eagle."
Johnny Carson,"holidays,emotions",Thanksgiving is an emotional holiday. People travel thousands of miles to be with people they only see once a year. And then discover once a year is way too often.
Johnny Carson,,Did you know Richard Nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist?
Johnny Carson,questions,"Adults ask questions as a child does. When you stop wondering, you might as well put your rocker on the front porch and call it a day."
Johnny Carson,,I started in a gaseous state and then I cooled.
Johnny Carson,,"I would like to say, for the record, that I am in favor of using more American Indians and other minorities in motion pictures, I am against polluting the oceans of the world, I am for every nationality having its own homeland, I am against whacking baby seals on the head, and I am for saving the whales. "
Johnny Carson,,"I think it would be a fatal mistake to use my show as a platform for controversial issues. I'm an entertainer, not a commentator. If you're a comedian your job is to make people laugh."
Johnny Carson,,"Welcome to the Academy Awards, a glittering two hours of entertainment, spread out over four hours. For those of you taping this on Betamax, you're under arrest."
Johnny Carson,"money,democracy,politics","Democracy is buying a big house you can't afford with money you don't have to impress people you wish were dead. And, unlike communism, democracy does not mean having just one ineffective political party; it means having two ineffective political parties."
Johnny Carson,democracy,May you have the income of a Republican and the sex life of a Democrat!

Johnny Carson,,It was so hot today I saw a pigeon walking in the shadow of Orson Welles.
Johnny Carson,,Never use a big word when a little filthy one will do.
Johnny Carson,"questions,success,talent","Talent alone won't make you a success. Neither will being in the right place at the right time, unless you are ready. The most important question is: ""Are your ready?"""
Johnny Carson,,We have two kinds of air: regular and chunky style.
Johnny Carson,democracy,"Democracy is welcoming people from other lands, and giving them something to hold onto - usually a mop or a leaf blower."
Johnny Carson,,I never analyze it. Analyzing it would just be a waste of time. I just go out and do it.
Johnny Carson,"acceptance,happiness",Happiness is seeing your son drafted the same day he's been accepted to an expensive college.
Johnny Carson,,"If it weren't for Philo T. Farnsworth, inventor of television, we'd still be eating frozen radio dinners."

Johnny Carson,,To this day I can't get aroused until I see a pair of rubber dice hanging from the mirror.
Johnny Carson,,I can empathize with President George Bush. I know what it feels like having a young guy waiting around for you to keel over.
Johnny Carson,,"I wanted the show to make the most of being the last area of television that the medium originally was supposed to be - live, immediate entertainment. I decided the best thing I could do was forget trying to do a lot of pre-planning. It all boiled down to just going out there and being my natural self and seeing what would happen."
Johnny Carson,,"I'm often asked, 'What is your favorite moment during the 30 years you hosted The Tonight Show?' I really don't have just one. The times I enjoyed the most were the spontaneous, unplanned segments that just happened, like Ed Ames' infamous 'Tomahawk Toss' that produced one of the longest laughs in television history. When these lucky moments happen, you just go with them and enjoy the experience and high of the moment."
Johnny Carson,elvis presley,"If life was fair, Elvis would be alive and all the impersonators would be dead."
Johnny Carson,,An oxymoron? What's that? A moron who studies at Oxford?
Johnny Carson,,"Ed and I were out last night and I asked him why he drank so much. He said he drank to forget. I asked him, ""To forget what?"" And he said he couldn't remember."

Johnny Carson,,Read my lips: No new promises.

Johnny Carson,,I know you've been married to the same woman for 69 years. That is marvelous. It must be very inexpensive.
Johnny Carson,,"In Los Angeles, the big story is that Police Chief Daryl Gates announced his retirement. It'll be sometime next year. Why can't a guy just retire without making a big deal of it?"

Johnny Carson,,Nancy Reagan fell down and broke her hair.

Johnny Carson,,"For days after death hair and fingernails continue to grow, but phone calls taper off."
Johnny Carson,,The bad news is that aliens have landed... the good news is that they pee gasoline.
Johnny Carson,men,Married men live longer than single men. But married men are a lot more willing to die.
Johnny Carson,"health,success","Never continue in a job you don't enjoy. If you're happy in what you're doing, you'll like yourself, you'll have inner peace. And if you have that, along with physical health, you will have had more success than you could possibly have imagined."
Johnny Carson,happiness,Happiness is your dentist telling you it won't hurt and then having him catch his hand in the drill.
Johnny Carson,democracy,"Democracy means that anyone can grow up to be president, and anyone who doesn't grow up can be vice president."
Johnny Carson,,May a holy man squat on your fez.
Johnny Carson,happiness,Happiness is seeing the muscular lifeguard all the girls were admiring leave the beach hand in hand with another muscular lifeguard.
Jon Stewart,,"If America leads a blessed life, then why did God put all of our oil under people who hate us?"
Jon Stewart,satire,"If you're going to give people 20 minutes of news satire, you've also got to give them Tiffani-Amber Thiessen or you're going to have rioting in the streets."
Jon Stewart,democracy,"Here in the U.S., we've made democracy into a science. A cold, impersonal science."
Jon Stewart,,"Across the nation, thousands of people are lining up in hospital waiting rooms, out the doors, down the steps, around the corners, and behind the hedges, waiting for their inoculations. Here's another idea for avoiding the flu: don't stand outside in the cold for hours around lots of other people. "
Jon Stewart,,"If the guy in front of you at the polls has arm swords, you might want to considering filling out an absentee ballot."
Jon Stewart,,"If we are going to amend the constitution, shouldn't it be to keep the omos-hay from arrying-may?"
Jon Stewart,,Megachurches. I can't be the only one frightened when our houses of worship sound like they could take on Godzilla.
Jon Stewart,,"I masturbate. A lot. And yet, I don't floss because it’s too much of a hassle. Ten seconds of joy over a lifetime of tooth decay, that's what I've chosen."
Jon Stewart,,I'm not a very serious Jew. I don't wear the protective religious headgear. They only wear that because 40% of all religious thoughts escape through the head.
Jon Stewart,,"Senator John McCain, who spent over five years in a Vietnamese POW camp, publicly releases 1,000 pages of medical records. Now people are left with only one nagging question: what kind of a freak has 1,000 pages of medical records."
Jon Stewart,,Models talk to you for six minutes and they're very nice and they say thank you and then it's off to the larger European men they actually have sex with.
Jon Stewart,"government,judgment",This is inarguably a failure of leadership from the top of the federal government. Remember when Bill Clinton went out with Monica Lewinsky. That was unarguably a failure of judgment at the top. Democrats had to come out and risk losing credibility if they did not condemn Bill Clinton for his behaviour. I believe Republicans are in the same position right now. And I will say this: Hurricane Katrina is George Bush’s Monica Lewinsky. The only difference is that tens of thousands of people weren’t stranded in Monica Lewinsky’s vagina.
Jon Stewart,,"President Bush announced his new economic plan. The centerpiece was a proposed repeal of the dividend tax on stocks, a boon that could be worth millions of dollars to average Americans. Well, average stock-owning Americans. Technically, Americans who own a significant amount of shares in dividend-dealing companies. Well, rich people, that's what I'm trying to say. They're going to do really well with this."
Jon Stewart,success,"I'm doing everything I can to sabotage my career. It's a little thing called ""fear of success""."
Jon Stewart,,"Dick Cheney and Karl Rove, once two of the most powerful men in this country, are now suffering from Balzheimer's disease. Why didn't I see it before? Balzheimer's is a terrible illness that attacks the memory and gives its victims the balls to attack others for things they themselves made a career of. There is no known cure."
Jon Stewart,,"Several weeks ago, South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford disappeared without explanation for five days. Now of course, as it turns out, he didn't really disappear. It turns out he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. Which is a trail that starts in Maine and ends in an Argentine woman's vagina."
Jon Stewart,,"They said I wasn't being funny. And I said to them, 'I know that, but tomorrow I will go back to being funny, and your show will still blow.'"
Jon Stewart,,We could overcome the baser aspects of our nature... and give this planet the kind of caretakers it deserves.
Jon Stewart,"animals,intelligence","Sheep are not considered the most intelligent animals but British scientist say humans may have underestimated the woolly creatures. In fact, the British scientific community is even suggesting that the animals might even be ""Irish-smart."""
Jon Stewart,,"Don't worry, as long as America still has natural resources, you guys are okay."
Jon Stewart,,I don't know how it didn't work out. How can a man who like other men and a woman who drinks not get along? The interesting thing is: there is no conceivable amount of money worth telling the world that you were beaten up by Liza Minnelli.
Jon Stewart,,"The wisdom of the masses is not always wise. You could put a lot of things to a vote-you could have put anti-miscegenation laws to a vote, and that would have passed pretty handily. Either all people are created equal-or they're not. You're either buying into the original premise of America-or you're not."
Jon Stewart,,"I wish I could say there was a magic formula, but I just kept working at it."
Jon Stewart,,"When in doubt, I can stare blankly. The rubber face. There's only so many ways you can stare incredulously at the camera and tilt an eyebrow, but that's your old standby: What would Buster Keaton do?"
Jon Stewart,,"I don't know what all the controversy is about, quite frankly. I've met Eminem, I met him backstage, and he's really gay."
Jon Stewart,,This show is our own personal beliefs.
Jon Stewart,,"Everybody wrings their hands about Fox News. You know, ""fair and balanced? Why, that's snide!"" Yeah, okay, maybe they're not fair and balanced, but CNN used to have the slogan ""You Can Depend on CNN"". Guess what? I watch it, no you can't. So what's the difference?"
Jon Stewart,,Do you guys have to sell everything? I'd like to buy the Earth's core.
Jon Stewart,,"Nazi Germany was so destructive to Judaism not only for the loss of life, but because many who survived began to see the practice of Judaism as somewhat of a health hazard."
Jon Stewart,,"If the presidency is the head of the American body politic, Congress is its gastrointestinal tract. Its vast and convoluted inner workings may be mysterious and unpleasant, but in the end they excrete a great deal of material whose successful passage is crucial to our nation's survival."
Jon Stewart,9/11,"You can always tell when Bush is in trouble. He always brings out 9/11. 9/11 is the cudgel that he waves. As far as he's concerned, it's ""Open Sesame"". 9/11 is his way of saying, ""Okay, I'm fucking up now, but remember four years ago? That was cool."" I think he thinks he can use it for anything. ""9/11. On 9/11 we were attacked. And so, I should get to bang your wife."" What? ""Now, there are some nay-sayers out there who think I shouldn't bang your wife, well, that's the cut-and-run crowd."""
Jon Stewart,,"As a comedian, as a person, as a citizen, as a mammal - in all of those areas, I am looking forward to the end of the Bush administration with every fiber of my being."
Jon Stewart,,"I am sick of deconstructing their propaganda, because it's pretty much the same as it's always been. It's just repeating something over and over again until we believe it and we hope that you believe it."
Jon Stewart,,"I can't control what people think this was. I can only tell you my intentions. This was not a rally to ridicule people of faith. Or people of activism or to look down our noses at the heartland or passionate argument or to suggest that times are not difficult and that we have nothing to fear. They are and we do. But we live now in hard times, not end times. And we can have animus and not be enemies."
Jon Stewart,,If you want to know why I’m here and what I want from you I can only assure you this: you have already given it to me. Your presence was what I wanted. Sanity will always be and has always been in the eye of the beholder. To see you here today and the kind of people that you are has restored mine. Thank you.
Jon Stewart,,Nineteen people flew into the towers. It seems hard for me to imagine that we could go to war enough to make the world safe enough that nineteen people wouldn't want to do harm to us. So it seems like we have to rethink a strategy that is less military-based.
Jon Stewart,,"You talk about the Pro-Life movement being one of the great shames of our nation. I think, if you want number two, I think - I think it's that. I think it's absolute - it's a travesty that people have forced someone who is gay to make their case that they deserve the same basic rights."
Jon Stewart,,"I think you are looking at sexuality and not attributes, and I think it's odd because the conservative mantra is a meritocracy. And I think what you're suggesting is the fact that being gay parents makes you not as good as others. And I would suggest that a loving, gay family with a financially secure background beats the hell out of Britney Spears and Kevin Federline any day of the week."
Jon Stewart,respect,"Although to be fair, cherry picking isn't quite what we do. Cherries are sweet and delicious. What we do is more turd mining. And I'll thank you to give our work the respect it deserves!"
Jon Stewart,,"It's the inevitable consummation of this largely manufactured battle between a man who makes people laugh for a living and whatever people think I do. In a televised, two-part hatefuck that is, by all measure, bound to dissapoint anyone that's been following it. Catch the fever!"
Jon Stewart,"knowledge,market",I can't rationalize the brilliance and knowledge that you have about the intricacies of the market with the crazy bullshit I see you do each night.
Jon Stewart,,The CEO of a company lied to you. But isn't that financial reporting?
Jon Stewart,,"When are we going to realize in this country that our wealth is work? That we're workers, and by selling this idea of, ""Hey man, I'll teach you how to be rich"" - how is that any different than an infomercial?"
Jon Stewart,,"When my syndicated show got canceled, the next day I still knew how to write jokes. That was a huge revelation. Because at first you think, ""I won't have any shelter! What am I gonna do? The sun is hot. Very thirsty."""
Jon Stewart,,"That whole thing has been overstated by environmentalists. First of all, what is it, rocks and snow? C'mon, what is that, you want that? Go to Canada my friend. Believe me, rocks and snow are overrated. I've seen otters - they look better covered in oil. "
Jon Stewart,,"When you're accustomed to doing stand-up, so often you're the only person onstage and it's all your thing. It's very gladiatorial. Obviously, when you're in a scene with somebody, you're supposed to listen and react - and that's a bit of a transition."
Jon Stewart,,I would think black people think everything is about race. They are the ones who are on the outside of the game. They are the ones who face it every day.
Jon Stewart,,I'm a little bit too obsessed with the news. I find the news easier to follow than narrative entertainment programs.
Jon Stewart,,Do you know what writing a book is? It's sitting alone in a room for weeks without making contact with another human. I felt like Howard Hughes.
Jon Stewart,,"Sitting around with funny people, banging out jokes and creating a television show. I have no hobbies, no outside interests. I'm fine with spending 14 hours a day putting a show together with tape and string."
Jon Stewart,change,I know change can be painful. But from change comes growth.
Jon Stewart,,"The real focus at first is to just become a good stand-up comedian, and then when you get to a certain level, then they allow you to do other things. You feel if you're overwhelmed by something or if you're not."
Jon Stewart,,"The goals for me have changed somewhat. There's a bit of seduction to the idea of being on network, but it got to the point where that wasn't important. What's important is doing something worthwhile. Which is why I've always avoided being on a sitcom. Yeah, it's high-profile and it's on a network, but you know what? You could be on Suddenly Stewart."
Jon Stewart,,"High school. You know, people say, 'I'll never do so-and-so again' - then they do it. So what? Sometimes somebody has crack, and you're looking to stay awake."
Jon Stewart,,"If I could be really competent, that goes such a long way toward things, because the majority of things are not competent. If I can be competent, and have moments of originality, that's all I would ask for."
Jon Stewart,,"But the main thing I don't want to be is un-funny. That's really the mandate. Just whatever we're doing, make it as funny as we can possibly make it. And believe me, if the show starts going down, we'll introduce a baby. We'll do everything that they did on `Family Ties.' I'm not afraid of that."
Jon Stewart,,"The disasters build a sort of odd Diacid feeling. When my syndicated show got canceled, the next day I still knew how to write jokes. That was a huge revelation. Because at first you think, 'I won't have any shelter! What am I gonna do? The sun is hot. Very thirsty.'"
Jon Stewart,,I’m not going to censor myself to comfort your ignorance.
Jon Stewart,,"Good evening everybody, ladies, gentlemen... Felicity."
Jon Stewart,,Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is a rare commodity in this day and age. And let the chips fall where they may.
Jon Stewart,hollywood,My life is a series of Hollywood orgies and Kabbalah center brunches with the cast of Friends. At least that’s what my handlers tell me. I’m actually too valuable to live my own life and spend most of my days in a vegetable crisper to remain fake news anchor fresh.
Jon Stewart,,If there’s anyone out there involved in illegal movie piracy... don't do it. Take a good look at these people. These are the people you're stealing from. Look at them! Face what you've done! There are women here who can barely afford enough gown to cover their breasts.
Jon Stewart,,"Get a sense of humor. If you don't, it'll be incredibly frustrating."
Jon Stewart,corporations,"Why is it that if you take advantage of a tax break and you're a corporation, you're a smart businessman, but if you take advantage of something you need to not be hungry, you're a moocher?"
Jon Stewart,democracy,"Any fool can blow something up. Any fool can destroy. But to see these guys, these firefighters and these policemen and people from all over the country, literally with buckets, rebuilding... that’s extraordinary. And that’s why we have already won... they can't... it's light. It’s democracy. They can't shut that down."
Jon Stewart,holidays,"Yon Kippur. Greatest Jewish holiday ever. The Jewish day of attonement. You don't ear for one day, all your sins for the year are wiped clean. Beat that with your little ""Lent."" What is Lent? Forty days of absolution. Forty days to one day. Even in sin you're paying retail."
Jon Stewart,,A half-hour show almost doesn't do it justice. There is so much material out there. The 24-hour news networks are talking about news analysis when they have no vested interest in news. They have vested interest in fanning the flames of conflict because that's what gets them ratings. That's what keeps them on the air.
Jon Stewart,,"Remember that guy who got gored by a bull and the bull pulled his underwear off and he had to run around the ring naked? If that footage comes out, I'll run that."
Jon Stewart,,"I like not to be good at anything, so I keep hopping around."
Jon Stewart,,"I probably owe you guys, like, five bucks."
Jon Stewart,,"Because sometimes ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX NEWS, MSNBC, CNN, HEADLINE NEWS, CSPAN, and CSPAN 2 just aren't enough."
Jon Stewart,,"I'm ""The Guy Who Seems to Be Ruining All Media."""
Jon Stewart,,"There's always anxiety when you start a new job, you're the one guy who doesn't know where the ketchup is."
Jon Stewart,,"My secret now is to try and make sure that my girlfriend, Tracey, is out of the house when I bring my dates home. That can be awkward."
Jon Stewart,,I have a lot of hostility.
Jon Stewart,,"I really enjoyed doing the book, but you don't get any reinforcement. You just sit in a room being yourself for a long time, and it's hard to get comfortable with that. The idea of getting back in there in a room with a bunch of funny people and just cranking out jokes is just really appealing to me."
Jon Stewart,,"I always get that cautionary warning right before I get off the phone with an interviewer. It's: 'Good luck with the show. I really like it, and if this goes wrong, you'll be hearing from my attorneys.'"
Jon Stewart,,"You feel kind of weird cheering for chaos. There is that sense that the crazier it gets, the better off we are. Before, when I was part of the American public, I was hoping for a reasonable and quick solution to the impeachment process. Now, I'm hoping for partisan bedlam and chaos. It's really what serves me best."
Jon Stewart,,"Whenever you take over something that is popular and has a fanatical following that loves it, you're never going to please everyone. The trick is to have enough wherewithal to follow through with what you want to do with it and give it time to evolve."
Jon Stewart,,"At first the difference will be in whatever atmosphere I bring into it. It's not going to be like, 'I really want to do The Daily Show and I'd love to turn it into an abstract musical.' I like the format and the chance to satirize the news."
Jon Stewart,,"The currency of this show is your own head. They've established a certain structure here, but it's still in evolution."
Jon Stewart,,"I really like to put my name on everything, so my roommate doesn't steal it. It's really a throwback to that."
Jon Stewart,,"Never name it after yourself. Maybe we'll throw a ""with"" in there. That seems to work. Like Late Show With David Letterman."
Jon Stewart,family,"If you don't get it right with your first family, you can always do it again with another."
Jon Stewart,,"You never hear a woman say, 'Hey, lets go to balls.'"
Jon Stewart,,Everyone just needs to get over themselves.
Jon Stewart,society,"As we approach the millennium with sort of the idea that society is going to start spiraling into chaos, I'd love to be making jokes about that. Who wants to miss out on that? If the world is going to end, I want to be there the night before, goofing off."
Jon Stewart,,"Hopefully the only things off-limits are crummy jokes, but being a standup comedian, I know that's not always the case... You know it when you have to take a shower afterward."
Jon Stewart,,"If you try to hit a grand slam, you're going to strike out."
Jon Stewart,,The Internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom.
Jon Stewart,,You wake up and you're still a little drunk and you can't believe that hot girl from last night actually has a beard and a penis.
Jon Stewart,,"What is the fear of the 'gay agenda' that has so upset people? Do people think that if gay people are given a place at the table, they'll be so convincing we'll all end up blowing them? What is the issue? 'You know, I'm straight, but you've made such a convincing argument...'"
Jon Stewart,,I don't care about wealth. What seems to be upsetting is institutionalizing the advantages that wealth gives you.
Jon Stewart,,"I've always liked Atlanta. And not just for the strip clubs, but the shopping and the food."
Jon Stewart,,I'm too short to host a late-night talk show. It's like the bar at an amusement-park ride. You have to be six foot two or over.
Jon Stewart,,"If you watch the news and don't like it, then this is your counter program to the news."
Jon Stewart,,We have it. The smoking gun. The evidence. The potential weapon of mass destruction we have been looking for as our pretext of invading Iraq. There's just one problem - it's in North Korea.
Jon Stewart,,I can be in 20 movies. But I'll never be an actor.
Jon Stewart,,I was born with an adult head and a tiny body. Like a 'Peanuts' character.
Jon Stewart,,"I'm thrilled to be asked to host the Academy Awards for the second time because, as they say, the third time's a charm."
Jon Stewart,arguments,"There is no such thing as an impartial jury because there are no impartial people. There are people that argue on the web for hours about who their favorite character on ""Friends"" is."
Jon Stewart,,"McVeigh's lawyer got him the death penalty, which, quite frankly, I could have done."
Jon Stewart,,Our culture is just a series of checks and balances. The whole idea that we're in a battle between tyranny and freedom - it's a series of pendulum swings.
Jon Stewart,,"President Bush remained undeterred by the massive display of American opposition, even though much of it came from the hundreds of thousands of voters who supported him by voting for Nader."
Jon Stewart,,"The seven marvels that best represent man's achievements over the last 2,000 years will be determined by Internet vote... so look for Howard Stern's Private Parts to come in No. 1."
Jon Stewart,,"There are a hell of a lot of jobs that are scarier than live comedy. Like standing in the operating room when a guy's heart stops, and you're the one who has to fix it!"
Jon Stewart,,"Yesterday, the president met with a group he calls the coalition of the willing. Or, as the rest of the world calls them, Britain and Spain."
Jon Stewart,"religion,dreams","Yes, the long war on Christianity. I pray that one day we may live in an America where Christians can worship freely! In broad daylight! Openly wearing the symbols of their religion... perhaps around their necks? And maybe - dare I dream it? - maybe one day there can be an openly Christian President. Or, perhaps, 43 of them. Consecutively."
Jon Stewart,,You have to remember one thing about the will of the people: it wasn't that long ago that we were swept away by the Macarena.
Jon Stewart,neighborhood,"I celebrated Thanksgiving in an old-fashioned way. I invited everyone in my neighborhood to my house, we had an enormous feast, and then I killed them and took their land."
Jon Stewart,,"More than 150 heads of state attended the UN Summit, giving New Yorkers a chance to get in touch with prejudices they didn't even know they had."
Jon Stewart,dreams,I'm not just a boy toy. I have feelings and dreams like anybody else.
Jon Stewart,,"You just have to keep trying to do good work, and hope that it leads to more good work. I want to look back on my career and be proud of the work, and be proud that I tried everything. Yes, I want to look back and know that I was terrible at a variety of things."
Jon Stewart,driving,"The first time I got to second base, I was driving and my friend was in the backseat getting tit. I considered that scoring - the rearview mirror was just a technicality. I didn't have sex until college - and even then, it's not like the floodgates opened. When I finally had a girlfriend, she ended up scoring with the goalie of the lacrosse team, so that didn't work out."
Jon Stewart,golf,"The Supreme Court ruled that disabled golfer Casey Martin has a legal right to ride in a golf cart between shots at PGA Tour events. Man, the next thing you know, they're going to have some guy carry his clubs around for him."
Jon Stewart,"democracy,aggression","So, is there hope for a truly democratic Africa? Long answer: Only if continent-wide improvements in education, human rights and public health are coupled with an aggressive and far-sighted debt-relief program that breaks the cycle of subsistence farming and urban squalor. Short answer: No."
Jon Stewart,,I have some bad news. Bjork cannot be here tonight. She was trying on her Oscar dress and Dick Cheney shot her.
Jon Stewart,"democracy,obama","Democrats do have an historic race going. Hillary Clinton vs. Barack Obama. Normally, when you see a black man or a woman president an asteroid is about to hit the Statue of Liberty."
Jon Stewart,,The best-laid plans of mice and comedians usually wind up on the cutting-room floor.
Jon Stewart,,"On an average day 7 minutes of news happens. Yet there are currently three full-time, 24-hour news networks."
Jon Stewart,politics,That's the beauty of our show. Comedy or politics. We're sort of a mix. A space age polymer of both. A synthetic comedy-like material.
Jon Stewart,,"The night I turned twenty-two, I drank a shot for every year. I was so drunk, I'd just walk up to people in the bar and hit them in the balls. My friends drove me home and left me propped up on the couch holding a bucket. I woke up with vomit all over me. The bucket was clean as a whistle."
Jon Stewart,"arguments,soccer","They create these rules and argue about things we don't even understand. It is like watching soccer. You sit there and you're sort of amused, but most of the time you're thinking, ""pick up the ball!"" That's what you're thinking."
Jon Stewart,swimming,"Body hair. You know when you're swimming as a kid and you want to crawl on your dad? None of us went anywhere near him. 'My god, a beaver! Everyone out of the pool!'"
Jon Stewart,soccer,"In 1982 I was playing soccer at William and Mary, and a kid from Randolph-Macon called me a kike. I ran after him. 'I'm not a... well, yes I am.'"
Jon Stewart,,Liberal and conservative have lost their meaning in America. I represent the distracted center.
Jon Stewart,democracy,It's not that the Democrats are playing checkers and the Republicans are playing chess. It's that the Republicans are playing chess and the Democrats are in the nurse's office because once again they glued their balls to their thighs.
Jon Stewart,,"I am a tiny, neurotic man, standing in the back of the room throwing tomatoes at the chalk board. And that's really it. And what we do is we come in in the morning and we go, ""Did you see that thing last night? Aahh!"" And then we spend the next 8 or 9 hours trying to take this and make it into something funny."
Jon Stewart,,I always knew I shouldn't have said that.
Jon Stewart,,No. I'm not going to be your monkey.
Jon Stewart,"government,madonna","On a personal note, I'm a comedian who makes fun of what I believe to be the absurdities of our government. Make my life difficult. Make this next four years really shitty for me, so that every morning all we can do is come in and go, 'Madonna is doing some Kaballah thing, you wanna do that?' I'd like that. I'm tired."
Jon Stewart,,"I've always run by the hierarchy of ""If not funny, interesting. If not interesting, hot. If not hot, bizarre. If not bizarre, break something."""
Jon Stewart,,I don't have a sort of Amway-esque chart up on my refrigerator or anything.
Jon Stewart,,Get there early because hope does not park your mother-fucking car.
Jon Stewart,,The only time a politico will try to avoid playing the blame game is when they or theirs are to blame.
Jon Stewart,,"Here’s how bizarre the war is that we’re in in Iraq, and we should have known this right from the get-go: When we first went into Iraq, Germany didn’t want to go. Germany. The Michael Jordan of war took a pass."
Jon Stewart,religion,Religion is far more of a choice than homosexuality.
Jon Stewart,,"GOP strategists hope the revelation of Kerry's wealth might debunk his status as a, quote, man of the people, and reveal him to be a bit of a fat cat. Unlike the President who as we all know before attending Andover and Yale, was a Cockney matchstick girl dying of tuberculosis."
Jon Stewart,,"Historic in a good sense, not historic in a sense of 'so we dropped bombs on everyone.'"
Jon Stewart,religion,"The nation of Dubai banned the movie Charlie's Angles because it's offensive to the religion of Islam. Apparently, the religion of Islam is offended by anything without a plot."
Jon Stewart,,"Does anyone know... does the Christian persecution complex have an expiration date? Because... uh... you've all been in charge pretty much since... uh... what was that guys name... Constantine. He converted in, what was it, 312 A.D. I'm just saying, enjoy your success."
Jon Stewart,,"I'm 38 and could very much bare my midriff, but it may make some people nauseous."
Jon Stewart,,"Despite his infirmities, Strom Thurmond showed up to work every day and did not miss a Senate vote in his final year, though no one is sure if a shouted ""Bingo!"" counted as a yea or a nay."
Jon Stewart,,That's what it's like to be a comedian. You basically stand and stare at the world and hope it craps out cause that's a good year for you. So that's not a pleasant feeling.
Jon Stewart,,"Scores of Iraqi exiles met in London to discuss ways to overthrow Saddam Hussein in a grand gathering dubbed the 'Iraqi Military Alliance Meeting.' Of course, these people are no longer Iraqi, they have no military, and there is no alliance. But they did have a meeting."
Jon Stewart,,"Just every moment with Dick Cheney has been my favorite. Here's what I wonder about Dick Cheney, and the reason that maybe they keep him only in loyalty oath audiences, is if he becomes angry, I do believe he turns into the Hulk. And so, they try and keep people from questioning him, because he'll just - the shirt rips, and suddenly he has hair. So he's been my favorite, because he just goes out there to a room full of supporters and says, 'You know we're all going to die, right?' You're going to die unless I'm in charge.'"
Jon Stewart,husband,Julie Christie was absolutely amazing in Away From Her. Brilliant movie. It was the moving story of a woman who forgets her own husband. Hillary Clinton calls it the feel good movie of the year.
Jon Stewart,,"President Bush's approval ratings have taken somewhat of a dive. A senior slump, if you will. Leading President Bush to one conclusion: He is the only one who realizes what a great job he's being doing."
Jon Stewart,,The Oscars is really I guess the one night of the year when you can see all your favorite stars without having to donate any money to the Democratic Party. And it's exciting for the stars as well because it's the first time many of you have ever voted for a winner.
Jon Stewart,9/11,"You know if I had nickel for every time Bush has mentioned 9/11, I could raise enough reward money to go after Bin Laden."
Jon Stewart,laws,"Even if the flag burning amendment does become law, the larger problem will remain of how to respectfully dispose of older, tattered flags. Well, fortunately the U.S. official Flag Code has a suggestion about this. Quote: 'The flag, when it is in such a condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem of display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.' Owwwwcchh. In response, the House Republicans are calling for tattered flags to be kept alive via a feeding tube."
Jon Stewart,,"If you're keeping score at home, so far our war in Iraq has created a police state in that country and socialism in Spain. So, no democracies yet, but we're really getting close."
Jon Stewart,,When did our elections become the Special Olympics? You're not all winners. Not everyone gets a hug. You guys got crushed.
Jon Stewart,,Give me back the $800 billion for the Iraq war and children’s television PBS is on the house.
Jon Stewart,,"Originally we were going to title it The Daily Show With Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays Off, but it was too long."
Jon Stewart,,"Oscar is 80 this year, which makes him now automatically the frontrunner for the Republican nomination."
Jon Stewart,,"Yes! Finally captured Martha Stewart. You know, with all the massive and almost completely unpunished fraud perpetrated on the American public by such companies as Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco and Adelphia, we finally got the ringleader. Maybe now we can lower the nation's terror alert to periwinkle."
Jon Stewart,,"I don't know why people think that somehow the First Amendment applies to network television. It doesn't. It's like the way free speech doesn't apply at work. You can't just walk into your boss' office and say 'you're a fuckface and I'm gonna go back to work now.' No, you're not."
Jon Stewart,complaints,"People would like to place a standard on our show that doesn't exist. We're not set up for reporting; we don't have an apparatus for that. We're discussing things that hopefully people might get something out of, but it's wildly inconsistent. Just because we hit on points that resonate, or people think are real complaints - that doesn't make us journalists."
Jon Stewart,,To have not shot his friend in the face would have sent a message to the quail that America is weak.
Jon Stewart,,Most world religions denounced war as a barbaric waste of human life. We treasured the teachings of these religions so dearly that we frequently had to wage war in order to impose them on other people.
Jon Stewart,,"If everything is amplified, we hear nothing."
Jon Stewart,,"Donald Rumsfeld. Love him or hate him, you've gotta admit: a lot of people hate him."
Jon Stewart,,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I figured this out. I know what's wrong with what we've done in Iraq. We've been following time as it goes forward. What a classic mistake. Linear time is so pre-9-11.
Jon Stewart,,"Why would these English explorers search for these spices, yet never use them in their food?"
Jon Stewart,language,"As our larynxes descended, we were able to make sounds with our mouths in new and far more expressive ways. Verbal language soon overtook physical gesturing as the primary means of communication for all human beings except Italians."
Jon Stewart,,"In fourteen hundred ninety-two Columbus sailed the ocean blue and discovered America. Now, some have argued Columbus actually discovered the West Indies, or that Norsemen had discovered America centuries earlier, or that you really can't get credit for discovering a land already populated by indigenous people with a developed civilization. Those people are communists. Columbus discovered America."
Jon Stewart,government,"What are you so mad about? That we still have a government? We still have “traffic lights.” We’re sorry. The government’s not perfect, but some people wish it was better, not gone."
Jon Stewart,,"What would Jesus, or any human being who isn't an asshole, do?"
Jon Stewart,politics,"If I was to really get at the burr in my saddle, it’s not politics - and this is, I think, probably a horrible analogy - but I look at politicians as, they are doing what inherently they need to do to retain power. Their job is to consolidate power. When you go to the zoo and you see a monkey throwing poop, you go, ‘That’s what monkeys do, what are you gonna do?’ But what I wish the media would do more frequently is say, 'Bad monkey.'"
Jon Stewart,,"I thinking gay and straight people use the same putters, it's not a matter of putters but a matter of hole selection."
Jon Stewart,,"As an adolescent, Vonnegut made my life bearable."
Jon Stewart,,"Bush proposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Some saw the move as an attempt to preserve traditional values, while others saw it as a cynical ploy to ensure that Vice President... Cheney will never have to pay for his gay daughter's wedding."
Jon Stewart,,"And then you've got Lieberman, who is for the war. And thinks the tax cuts could really help. He's basically for people who want to vote for Bush but don't think Bush is Jewish enough."
Jon Stewart,,"I think of myself as a comedian who has the pleasure of writing jokes about things that I actually care about. And that's really it. You know, if I really wanted to enact social change I have great respect for people who are in the front lines and the trenches of trying to enact social change. I am far lazier than that."
Jon Stewart,,"We'd always sworn, we're taking 60 Minutes down. You, Frontline, all you guys. You're meat."
Jon Stewart,opportunities,"We don't consider ourselves equal opportunity anythings, because that's not - you know, that's the beauty of fake journalism. We don't have to - we travel in fake ethics."
Jon Stewart,,"I've been to Canada, and I've always gotten the impression that I could take the country over in about two days."
Jon Stewart,,Thomas Jefferson once said: 'Of course the people don't want war. But the people can be brought to the bidding of their leader. All you have to do is tell them they're being attacked and denounce the pacifists for somehow a lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.' I think that was Jefferson. Oh wait. That was Hermann Goering. Shoot.
Jon Stewart,,Fatherhood is great because you can ruin someone from scratch.
Jon Stewart,,"You know what they say: If at first you don't succeed, fuck it."
Jon Stewart,new york,"I was born in New York City, but I was raised in New Jersey, part of the great Jewish emigration of 1963."
Jon Stewart,,"61% of graduating teens have had sex, 37% will eventually have sex, and 2% become statisticians."
Jon Stewart,advertising,"In case you're wondering what we all do here during the commercial breaks, mostly we just sit around making catty remarks about the outfits you're all wearing at home."
Jon Stewart,,"Like everyone else, I want to sleep with Leonardo DiCaprio."
Jon Stewart,,"He's not stupid ... he's not a retarded man ... he just doesn't give a shit about you, or anything."
Jon Stewart,respect,"I thought those two guys really vibed on each other. They seem to have a very respectful relationship. It felt really sincere. ""I respect you, you respect me."" And I'm not usually a big fan of sincerity."
Jon Stewart,,"It's lunch time in the Diamond District. All the stores close down and the street is filled with chasidim, who suddenly find themselves caught in Yidlock."
Jon Stewart,,The value of holding a grudge. And to always refer to my father sarcastically as Mr. Wonderful.
Jon Stewart,,"I mean, I'm not hoping for the apes and the monolith. I'm hoping for controlled chaos to assist us."
Jon Stewart,inspiration,Insomnia is my greatest inspiration.
Jon Stewart,complaints,"Jews and Blacks come from the same history - 2,000 years of bullshit. We just expressed our suffering differently as people. Blacks developed the blues. Jews complain, we just never thought of putting it to music."
Jon Stewart,"change,challenges","Every generation has their challenge. And things change rapidly, and life gets better in an instant."
Jon Stewart,challenges,"Everybody talks about the entitlement generation. There is no time I would rather live in than now… There’s a tendency to live in a nostalgic state in this country, and think that other generations possessed an integrity and a tenacity better than the generation that is now. I wholeheartedly disagree with that, and I believe this is a group that will rise up to any challenge that comes before them, as well as any other generation in America would have done. My advice to them would be to please don’t think of me as an entitled moocher when I’m collecting my government benefits."
Jon Stewart,heaven,They always throw around this term 'the liberal elite.' And I kept thinking to myself about the Christian right. What's more elite than believing that only you will go to heaven?
Jon Stewart,satire,"To me, that's where a lot of satire lies. News used to hold itself to a higher plane and slowly it has dissolved into, well, me."
Jon Stewart,"dreams,business","You know, I've always wanted to be a young Charles Kuralt. I started in this business with just a Winnebago and a dream."
Jon Stewart,business,"Some are from the world of the arts, some from the fields of business, architecture, wine-making and education. What they have in common is that they are all known nationally - and many internationally - for their wide-ranging achievements."
Jon Stewart,"jail,driving,new york","New York became the first state to ban talking on hand-held cell phones while driving. First-time violators could receive a fine of $100, with an additional mandatory six-month jail sentence if your ringer plays a Latin-themed novelty song."
Jon Stewart,"government,criticism,fitness","Critics noted Schwarzenegger's only previous government experience was serving as chairman of the Council of Physical Fitness, where his only responsibility was doing hundreds of jumping jacks he was doing anyway."
Jon Stewart,,"Capote, of course, addressed very similar themes to Good Night and Good Luck. Both films are about determined journalists defying obstacles in a relentless pursuit of the truth. Needless to say, both are period pieces."
Jon Stewart,army,"Gay people can't be proud of the country and want to defend it too. What's the army afraid is going to happen if gay people are in it. ""Private, shoot that man!"" ""I can't, he's adorable."""
Jon Stewart,,"I don't want to die before my parents die, especially my mother. Because I think that's tragic. Because I don't want her to get the chance to pick out what I'm going to wear for eternity."
Jon Stewart,audience,"Hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill. In some respects, the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most - you know, the difference between potential and kinetic energy? - they have the most potential energy, so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion, the most interest. I don't mean for the audience. I mean for us. Everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we don't care about."
Jon Stewart,business,I think people are used to people in show business having a lot of hubris. I think I have a normal amount of self-loathing but because I'm in show business it's considered self-deprecation. In normal life I would just be considered your average neurotic.
Jon Stewart,marijuana,"Here's the point - you're looking at affirmative action, and you're looking at marijuana. You legalize marijuana, no need for quotas, because really, who's gonna wanna work?"
Jon Stewart,,"We came, we saw, we sucked."
Jon Stewart,,"Most Americans don't live their lives solely as Democrats or Republicans or conservatives or liberals. Most Americans live their lives that our just a little bit late for something they have to do. Often it’s something they do not want to do, but they do it. Impossible things get done every day that are only made possible by the little, reasonable compromises."
Jon Stewart,politics,"If someone was to introduce hope and idealism into our political system, I think the tension that would create in other areas would certainly be ripe. You would think that if you bring oxygen to the organism, the organism lives. But there may be other organisms in there that thrive in darkness and in a more anaerobic environment. Watching those creatures writhe will always be interesting."
Jon Stewart,,I just wanted to tell you why I grieve - but why I don’t despair.
Jon Stewart,,"We hear every damn day about how fragile our country is - on the brink of catastrophe - torn by polarizing hate, and how it’s a shame that we can’t work together to get things done, but the truth is we do. We work together to get things done every damn day!"
Jon Stewart,laziness,"The bias of the mainstream media is toward sensationalism, conflict, and laziness."
Jon Stewart,,"If you don't stick to your values when they're being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies."
Jon Stewart,,"But we are at war, and we here at The Daily Show will do our best to keep you informed of any late-breaking... humor we can find. Of course, our show is obviously at a disadvantage compared to the many news sources that we're competing with… at a disadvantage in several respects. For one thing, we are fake. They are not. So in terms of credibility we are, well, oddly enough, actually about even. We're about even."
Jon Stewart,,"Ahh, Earth Day, the only day of the year where being able to hacky-sack will get you laid."
Jon Stewart,,"I heard Dennis Kucinich say in a debate, 'When I'm president...' and I just wanted to stop him and say, 'Dude.'"
Jon Stewart,religion,"Yes, reason has been a part of organized religion, ever since two nudists took dietary advice from a talking snake."
Jon Stewart,,The Westboro Baptist Church is no more a church than Church's Fried Chicken is a church.
Jon Stewart,,"The more you delve into science, the more it appears to rely on faith."
Jon Stewart,religion,Religion. It's given people hope in a world torn apart by religion.
Jon Stewart,soul,Sarcasm - I get it now! See at the time I thought your jokey manner was just the way you were sublimating your shame over the discomfort you feel deep in your soul after extinguishing the last smoldering embers of any of your program’s journalistic bonafides!
Jon Stewart,,"If I'd only followed CNBC's advice, I'd have a million dollars today. Provided I'd started with a hundred million dollars."
Jon Stewart,,Being a superpower is like being a Santa Claus that everyone hates.
Jon Stewart,,No one is better at not beating America than England.
Jon Stewart,acceptance,"I feel your scorn, and I accept it."
Jon Stewart,,"Happy Valentine's Day! And if this is news to you, my guess is you're probably alone. Valentine's Day is often times a, well, it's a manufactured day that really doesn't mean anything."
Jon Stewart,,"I can't sing. Never been able to sing. I can't do voices very well. Every impression I do sounds the same. I can't dunk. Man, would I give anything to dunk. Just once."
Jon Stewart,,Don't cross Lorenzo Lamas. Ever.
Jon Stewart,,"Last week North Korea publicly admitted for the first time it has nuclear weapons. The Bush administration has so far shown very little concern, as the North Korean missiles are believed only capable of reaching the Blue States."
Jon Stewart,decisions,"Maybe we should always show pictures. Bin Laden, pictures of our wounded service people, pictures of maimed innocent civilians. We can only make decisions about war if we see what war actually is - and not as a video game where bodies quickly disappear leaving behind a shiny gold coin."
Jon Stewart,new york,"The Jews celebrate Passover by eating unpalatable food to remind them what will happen to their people if they ever leave New York City. The traditional meal often includes gefilte fish. For those of you who don't know what gefilte fish is, it strongly resembles a ball of tuna fish that has been passed nasally. It's not good. During Passover, the angel of death passed over the Jews - an event that, up until the late 1950s, was re-enacted every year by Ivy League colleges and suburban country clubs."
Jon Stewart,democracy,"A free and independent press is essential to the health of a functioning democracy. It serves to inform the voting public on matters relevant to its well-being. Why they've stopped doing that is a mystery. I mean, 300 camera crews outside a courthouse to see what Kobe Bryant is wearing when the judge sets his hearing date, while false information used to send our country to war goes unchecked? What the fuck happened?"
Jon Stewart,,"It upset me that, five days after the hurricane hit down in New Orleans, the President's plan was for a day of prayer. I would have thought a truck of food. A day of prayer. Now, maybe I'm mistaken here and, again, I'm not a scientific expert, but isn't a hurricane officially an act of God? Isn't a day of prayer kind of redundant? Hasn't God already made up his mind on that sort of thing? So we do a day of prayer. The President has his stupid day of prayer. Three days later, Hurricane Rita hits. Somebody must have said something... something like, ""is that all you got?"""
Jon Stewart,government,You wonder sometimes how our government puts on its pants in the morning.
Jon Stewart,,"Honest or not, in what world is a 35:1 leveraged position sane?"
Jon Stewart,advertising,"As long as I don't end up hosting a skin care commercial with Cher, I'm happy."
Jon Stewart,obama,"If Obama's a tyrant, he's a pretty tame tyrant. How many tyrants do you know that really suffer because they can't get cloture?"
Jon Stewart,politics,"The country’s 24 hour political pundit perpetual panic conflictinator did not cause our problems but its existence makes solving them that much harder. The press can hold its magnifying up to our problems bringing them into focus, illuminating issues heretofore unseen or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected dangerous flaming ant epidemic. If we amplify everything we hear nothing."
Jon Stewart,,We grew up in the good old days before kids had these damn computers and actually played outside.
Jon Stewart,"9/11,terrorists","If the events of September 11, 2001, have proven anything, it's that the terrorists can attack us, but they can't take away what makes us American - our freedom, our liberty, our civil rights. No, only Attorney General John Ashcroft can do that."
Jon Stewart,,Why did the Articles of Confederation fail so completely? Most historians believe the founding fathers spent a great deal of their first constitutional convention drafting the delaration of independence and only realized on July 3rd the Articles were also due.
Jon Stewart,,"I reject the idea there are just two sides. I think that with the amount of ideas and thoughts there are, it’s not even going to be consistent with the same person. People can hold liberal and conservative dogma points at the same time. They’re not living their lives via platforms. They’re living their lives. The whole thing is an awfully tired construct."
Jon Stewart,,"To the people who are upset about their hard-earned tax money going to things they don’t like: welcome to the fucking club. Reimburse me for the Iraq war and oil subsidies, and diaphragms are on me!"
Jon Stewart,,"The press can hold its magnifying glass up to our problems and illuminate problems heretofore unseen, or it can use its magnifying glass to light ants on fire, and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected dangerous-flaming-ant epidemic. If we amplify everything, we hear nothing."
Jon Stewart,,"If you try to hit a grand slam, you’re going to strike out."
Jon Stewart,,"Reform Jews are the children of Conservative Jews, or as they are sometimes known, Christians with curlier hair."
Jon Stewart,army,"Many of our soldiers are stationed at Camp Coyote just south of the Iraqi border. This is how you know we have a strong army, when you can actually tell your enemy exactly where your camp is and what its name is."
Jon Stewart,,"Look, we're both snake oil salesman to a certain extent, but we do label the show as snake oil here. Isn't there a problem selling snake oil as vitamin tonic?"
Jon Stewart,teachers,"I remember having a grade-school teacher I thought was a hard-ass. When you're that age, you think the guy is Himmler. Then you visit him eight years later and he's wearing polyester pants, he's four foot eight, you think he's gay, and you're like, 'Are you the guy I was afraid of?'"
Jon Stewart,"shoes,baseball","My life was typical. I played a little Little League baseball. I never wanted for food. I always had shoes. I had a room. There were no great tragedies. There were the typical ups and downs but I wouldn' t say it was at all sad. We were Jewish and living in the suburbs so there was a slightly neurotic bent to it, but I can't point to anything where a boy overcame a tragedy to become a comedian. As my grandmother used to say, 'I can't complain.'"
Jon Stewart,dreams,"By the way, when you finish the bottle of Crown Royal, you can still use the pouch to hold your broken dreams."
Jon Stewart,judgment,"Pigmentation was a quick and convenient way of judging a person. One of us, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once proposed we instead judge people by the content of their character. He was shot."

Jon Stewart,,"We must, together as a nation, stop watching Fox."
Jon Stewart,,When did fact checking and journalism go their separate ways?
Jon Stewart,business,"That is amazing! I mean these CEOs saying their own businesses are doing OK! I mean, it makes sense to take these CEOs word for it. For instance, I know O.J. Simpson. He told me he didn't kill anyone and he should know, he was there!"
Jon Stewart,,"You can use your idealism to further your aims, if you realize that nothing is Nirvana, nothing is perfect."
Jon Stewart,tea,The problem with the Tea Party is they're all ignorant hillbillies who drink moonshine and ride around on mules. And they believe in stereotypes too.
Jon Stewart,,"We declared war on terror - it's not even a noun, so, good luck. After we defeat it, I'm sure we'll take on that bastard ennui."
Jon Stewart,society,"The reason I don’t worry about society is, nineteen people knocked down two buildings and killed thousands. Hundreds of people ran into those buildings to save them. I’ll take those odds every fucking day."
Jon Stewart,,I have complete faith in the continued absurdity of whatever’s going on.
Jon Stewart,,"I visit Fox News every now and again, and it’s nice, because the Eye of Mordor is above the building."
Jon Stewart,,"Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit adultery. Don't eat pork. I'm sorry, what was that last one?? Don't eat pork. God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to outsmart everybody?"
Jon Stewart,neighborhood,"It's great having Bruce Springsteen on my show. We have so much in common! We're both from New Jersey, just from different neighborhoods. Sort of like how Martin Luther King and Margaret Mitchell both came from Atlanta. But from different neighborhoods."
Jon Stewart,,"Alright guys, I want to get out there and vote tomorrow. And not because it's cool, because it's not. You know what is cool? Smoking. Smoke while you vote."
Jon Stewart,politics,"He had a passion and a depth of belief, and an optimism, and a tenacity that I very much admired. He was one of the first people I remember learning about, and maybe his death left an indelible mark. I felt that Robert Kennedy was a man of political integrity."
Jon Stewart,celebrities,We all know what happens to celebrities when their time is up - rehab and then a stint on VH1.
Jon Stewart,army,We are not warriors in anyone's army. And that is not trying to be self-deprecating. I'm proud of what we do. I really like these two shows. I like making 'em. I like watching them. I'm really proud of them. But I understand their place. I don't view us as people who lead social movements.
Jon Stewart,,"And try as I might, I am having difficulty giving a fuck."
Jon Stewart,,"For me it was just exciting to see fake news catching on like that. We don't you know, it's interesting. I think we don't make things up. We just distill it to, hopefully, its most humorous nugget. And in that sense it seems faked and skewed just because we don't have to be subjective or pretend to be objective. We can just put it out there."
Jon Stewart,"inspiration,obama","Everybody thought Barack Obama was going to inspire people when he came to Washington, but, you know, the Senate seems like the place where smart people go to die."
Jon Stewart,,Here's the way I look at it. President Bush has uranium-tipped bunker busters and I have puns. I think he'll be OK.
Jon Stewart,army,"Why can't they have gay people in the army? Personally, I think they are just afraid of a thousand guys with M16s going, ""Who'd you call a faggot?"""
Jon Stewart,,"Orthodox Jews, or, as they are known in the Talmud, the Really Chosen Ones, are committed to the idea that the entire Torah was dictated by God verbatim to Moses at Mount Sinai... Other forms of Judaism dispute this claim, although it does explain certain passages in the first Torah, such as, ""I'm sorry, am I boring you?"" and ""What do you like better, Moses, Lord Almighty or Big Hoohah?"""
Jon Stewart,new year,"What you do for Jewish New Year is you go down to Times Square... It's a lot quieter than the regular New Year. It's just a few Jews walking around going, ""'sup?"""
Jon Stewart,soul,I think the metric by which television is considered liberal is literally based on the metric of liberalism in each person's soul. Peoples' senses of humor tend to go about as far as their ideology.
Jon Stewart,"government,democracy,terrorists","Terrorists are planning to disrupt our democratic process. It's scary I know, but we're not going to let al Qaeda tell us what to do. In fact, our government has decided that if al Qaeda attempts to disrupt our democratic process, we are going to respond by disrupting it first."
Jonathan Winters,television,"Now the freaks are on television, the freaks are in the movies. And it's no longer the sideshow, it's the whole show. The colorful circus and the clowns and the elephants, for all intents and purposes, are gone, and we're dealing only with the freaks."
Jonathan Winters,,"I was talking to a businessman, and I said, ""Don't you think most men are little boys?"" And he said, ""I'm no little boy! I make seventy-five thousand dollars a year."" And I said, ""Well, the way I look at it - you just have bigger toys."""
Jonathan Winters,society,"When you wear so many hats in society, you never know who you are. That's the beauty of it. Because once you find out who you are, you're screwed."
Jonathan Winters,,Nothing is impossible. Some things are just less likely than others.
Jonathan Winters,success,"I couldn't wait for success, so I went ahead without it."

Kevin James,,"Thanksgiving, man. Not a good day to be my pants."

Kevin James,california,"For some reason and I don't know why, but I don't think that I'm funny in California. So I always want to do my movies east somewhere."
Kevin James,,"Let go of the damn door! Sit your ass on the kerb, I will come around and let ya in!"
Kevin James,,Back in '93 I saw my first UFC fight and just became enamored by it then.
Kevin James,,"This annoyed me: I was on the phone with somebody today trying to get a phone number from that person and write it down, but they didn't have phone number rhythm and that pissed me off. You know what I'm talking about? Phone number rhythm. Especially if there's like an area code involved, like 'two one two - bum bum buh - bum buh bum buh!' That is the rhythm I think we're all familiar with. This guy had no clue! I was like ""Okay, Hank. Gimme the number."" He's like ""Alright. It's two one two nine - fifteen eight eleven six fou... tw... five... eight... seven... two."" ""Did you throw in your zip code? Cause I got a lot of extra numbers over here. I have extra. I can almost start a new number! What do ya got?! Start again from the top!"" They really screw you up on the last four numbers. That's where they get ya. ""Five five five - six... teen forty one"" ""Dude, I already wrote the six! I made the dash too close, I can't shimmy the one in there now! Forget you!"""
Kevin James,,"It was fun because, after shooting, Will and I would eat a jar of pickles and tell each other secrets. It was so much fun!"
Kevin James,,"I did stand-up my whole career, and Vince didn't, and it's a little frustrating when he's funnier than me, and that bothers me a little bit."
Kevin James,,How about we work out a plan at my apartment and dinner should be around. So we can just do both.
Kevin James,,Why do you always give me jobs you know I'm going to fail at?
Kevin James,,It's always cool to meet people who can do things that you have no capacity to do.
Kevin James,,"If I do a movie where I have to have a son and it's a chubby kid, my mother is always like, 'You were never like that.' She gets so upset about it."
Kevin James,,I've always had something in my heart where I root for guys who struggle with women.
Kevin James,,"I would always love to be an athlete, but it's got to be a tough day when you have to hang up those cleats."
Kevin James,,"I want to do movies that I'm proud of where my kids, at some point, can see and I can feel comfortable sitting there watching it with them. And just that move people. That make people feel a little bit better about themselves when they leave the theatre."
Kevin James,,"I try to connect with the everyday, every guy."
Kevin James,"inspiration,teachers","Teachers have a chance to mold someone, inspire them. I hope all teachers realize that."
Kevin James,,I don't want to be known as this goody-two-shoes who can only do comedies where puppies are licking peanut butter off my face.
Kevin James,,"I've always been the guy who doesn't necessarily get it with women. A woman would have to say, 'I like you, I want to go out with you, you can ask me.' And still I would question it. Did she mean it?"
Kevin James,,I took a public speaking class in college and managed to make the class laugh a little bit.
Kevin James,,I could never be James Bond.

Kevin James,,"I just want to put some positive stuff out there. If it works, great. If it doesn't, no problem."
Kevin James,fitness,My fitness goals are different than most peoples. Most people want to lose enough weight so they look good in a bathing suit or they want to lower their cholesterol. I just want to lose enough so my stomach doesn't jiggle when I brush my teeth.
Kevin James,,I never played a musical instrument growing up but I knew kids who did and took it very seriously.
Kevin James,,"Now I'm starting to jog. But every time I do jog I have 9-1 pressed into my phone, with the next '1' ready to be launched in case I drop."
Kevin James,,"You know, when you're a fat guy you don't need a reason to sweat. Guys come up to me and go ""Jeez... what have you been doing - jumping rope in the attic or something?"" ""Umm, no... I peeled an orange about an hour ago, why?"""
Kevin James,inspiration,"I never played music, but it's an important thing... the studying, the inspiration."
Kevin James,,I think I invented the phrase 'Don't overdo it.'
Kevin James,,My favorite movie of all time is 'Rocky.'
Kevin James,baseball,"As American as an apple is and as American as baseball is, they don't go together. You can't be chewing an apple at a baseball game. You've got to let go of the diet that day."
Kevin James,,Once a year my back will go out and it'll be... it's like a sciatic thing and it's the smallest thing. Like I could be leaning over the sink to brush my teeth in a weird way and it happens.
Kevin James,,"I know De Niro, you know, it's all famous that he packed on 60 pounds for Raging Bull, but ah, he just did it for one movie, I do that for every movie."
Kevin James,audience,Just me onstage with a mike having an intimate relationship with the audience. I don't get nervous for that. I just get excited.
Kevin James,hollywood,I'm not a Hollywood guy.
Kevin James,new york,"I had my boy in Boston on Easter Sunday. That kills me, from a sports perspective. He's a Boston baby and I'm a New York guy."
Kevin James,teachers,"I had many teachers that were great, positive role models and taught me to be a good person and stand up and be a good man. A lot of the principals they taught me still affect how I act sometimes and it's 30 years later."
Kevin James,,"You think school ends when it ends, but it doesn't."
Kevin James,,"There, there's your skin-flap. That piece that looks like my ass caught fire and somebody put it out with an old t-shirt is yours."
Kevin Pollak,,"I am completely and utterly hooked to all the great shows on A&E and Court TV that are about small town murder. These shows like ""Forensic Files"", ""City Confidential"", I just can't get enough of them. It's always the same sort of deal. You know that they interview the actual people that lived through the experience. I miss Paul Winfield as the host of ""City Confidential"", may he rest in peace."
Kevin Pollak,"gays,laws",The law against sodomy is trying to stop homosexual men from enjoying themselves. That's what the law is all about. But this is stupid. What do you do according to the law? You find two men enjoying themselves sexually. You arrest them and throw them in... prison? That outta do it.
Kevin Pollak,,"Peter Hyams - and these are his words, it sounds a little self-serving, sharing them from me - his suggestion was that Gabriel and I could lend a credibility, acting-wise, to an otherwise big, sloppy studio action film."
Kevin Pollak,ice cream,"No one smokes because they like the way it tastes. If we did, they'd make cigarette-flavored cookies, candy, ice cream. ""What is this? Marlboro fudge with nuts? Give me a scoop of that, willya? She's gonna have the Menthol Swirl with the Camel chip."""
Kevin Pollak,audience,"As rewarding as a good film role can be, there is just nothing like getting up on a stage and taking an audience for a ride. You make a movie, and the audience may not see it for another 10 months. Here, you know immediately their reaction."
Kevin Pollak,"market,iphone","If we do have any iPhone users out there, I have incredibly great news for you. I've developed after about six months and finally perfected and it'll be out on the market soon, an app that you'll all want. It allows you to make a phone call."
Larry Miller,,"As women well know, the reason men are no good at playing dumb is most of the time we're not playing."
Larry Miller,"judgment,heaven,white house",I don't want a clean living guy in the White House with his finger on the button. He thinks he's going right to heaven. You want to feel safe with a leader. Give me a guy who fights in bars and cheats on his wife. This is a man who wants to put off Judgment Day as long as possible.
Larry Miller,market,"Manufacturers are making products kosher to get in on that market, plus more people are looking for kosher."
Larry Miller,,"Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to get old is when we're kids? If you're less than ten years old, you're so excited about aging that you think in fractions. ""How old are you?"" ""I'm four and a half."" You get into your teens; now they can't hold you back. You jump to the next number. ""How old are you?"" ""I'm gonna be 16."" Then the great day of your life; you become 21. Then you turn 30. What happened there? Makes you sound like bad milk. Then you're pushing 40. You reach 50; then you make it to 60. By then you've built up so much speed, you hit 70. After that, it's a day by day thing. You hit Wednesday... You get into your 80's; you hit lunch, you hit 4:30. My Grandmother won't even buy green bananas. ""Well, it's an investment, you know, and maybe a bad one."" Into the 90's, you start going backwards. ""I was just 92."" Then a strange thing happens; if you make it over 100, you become a little kid again. ""I'm 100 and a half."""
Larry Miller,,"I've been a character actor, which I define as ""anyone in the movie who's not kissing Renee Zellweger."
Larry Miller,business,"Everything's nerve-wracking; you really shouldn't be in show business if you can't stand situations that are nerve-wracking, and you just have to learn to push that aside or rip it off and graft it onto your positive, creative energy. I mean, c'mon, I've been in 40, 50 movies and a bunch of TV shows. Someone asked a few months ago how many auditions I took, and I said, ""Boy, you got me. A lot, I guess. 700? 2,700? I don't know."" And then I started thinking and realized, ""Boy, I guess that's a lot."" You know what, either get some hard bark on you, or find another line."
Larry Miller,,"It doesn't burn unless you take too long to blow it out. How true that is, for life in general."
Larry Miller,,"I was asleep, in the upstairs bedroom, in the rear of the house. There was this tremendous crash, there was a terrible wind force hitting my body, and then I blanked out."
Larry Miller,dogs,"To women, we are like big dogs that talk."
Larry Miller,"women,differences","Women say they have sexual thoughts too. They have no idea. It's the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. If they knew what we were really thinking, they'd never stop slapping us."
Larry Miller,,"Every time a friend of mine has a kid I go over to the crib and say, ""You know, I used to hold your father’s head while he threw up."""
Lenny Bruce,art,"The only honest art form is laughter, comedy. You can't fake it... try to fake three laughs in an hour - ha ha ha ha ha - they'll take you away, man. You can't."
Lenny Bruce,,I credit the motion picture industry as the strongest environmental factor in molding the children of my day.
Lenny Bruce,dogs,Guys are like dogs. They keep coming back. Ladies are like cats. Yell at a cat one time... they're gone.

Lenny Bruce,government,"If you can't say ""Fuck"" you can't say, ""Fuck the government."""
Lenny Bruce,audience,"The role of a comedian is to make the audience laugh, at a minimum of once every fifteen seconds."
Lenny Bruce,business,When you're eight years old nothing is your business.
Lenny Bruce,violence,"All my humor is based upon destruction and despair. If the whole world were tranquil, without disease and violence, I'd be standing on the breadline right in back of J. Edgar Hoover."
Lenny Bruce,,"A lot of people say to me, 'Why did you kill Christ?' I dunno, it was one of those parties, got out of hand, you know."
Lenny Bruce,school,"I won't say ours was a tough school, but we had our own coroner. We used to write essays like: What I'm going to be if I grow up."
Lenny Bruce,,Never trust a preacher with more than two suits.
Lenny Bruce,,"The thing with Catholicism, the same as all religions, is that it teaches what should be, which seems rather incorrect. This is ''what should be.'' Now, if you're taught to live up to a ''what should be'' that never existed - only an occult superstition, no proof of this ''should be'' - then you can sit on a jury and indict easily, you can cast the first stone, you can burn Adolf Eichmann, like that!"
Lenny Bruce,,The only truly anonymous donor is the guy who knocks up your daughter.
Lenny Bruce,"wife,teachers",That's where the conflict starts. We all want for a wife a combination Sunday school teacher and a $500-a-night hooker.
Lenny Bruce,,"The ""what should be"" never did exist, but people keep trying to live up to it. There is no ""what should be,"" there is only what is."
Lenny Bruce,new york,"If you live in New York, even if you're Catholic, you're Jewish."
Lenny Bruce,politics,"Liberals will buy anything a bigot writes. In fact, they really support hate mongers. George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi Party is probably a very knowledgeable businessman with no political convictions what so ever. He gets three bucks a head and works the mass rallies consisting of nothing but angry Jews, shaking their fists and wondering why there are so many Jews there. And Rockwell probably has only two real followers - and they're deaf. They think the swastika is merely an Aztec symbol."
Lenny Bruce,hate,I hate small towns because once you've seen the cannon in the park there's nothing else to do.
Lenny Bruce,,"Never tell. Not if you love your wife... In fact, if your old lady walks in on you, deny it. Yeah. Just flat out and she'll believe it: ""I'm tellin' ya. This chick came downstairs with a sign around her neck 'Lay on Top of Me Or I'll Die.' I didn't know what I was gonna do...."""
Lenny Bruce,satire,"Satire is tragedy plus time. You give it enough time, the public, the reviewers will allow you to satirize it. Which is rather ridiculous, when you think about it."
Lenny Bruce,,"""Sex"" and ""obscenity"" are not synonymous."
Lenny Bruce,,"You put a guy on a desert island, he'll do it to mud, a chicken, a barrel, anything, a knothole."
Lenny Bruce,"truth,nowdays,audience","Today's comedian has a cross to bear that he built himself. A comedian of the older generation did an ''act'' and he told the audience, ''This is my act.'' Today's comic is not doing an act. The audience assumes he's telling the truth. What is truth today may be a damn lie next week."
Lenny Bruce,,There are never enough I Love You's.
Lenny Bruce,restaurants,"I've been accused of bad taste, and I'll go down to my grave accused of it and always by the same people, the ones who eat in restaurants that reserve the right to refuse service to anyone."
Lenny Bruce,motivation,"The whole motivation for any performer is ""Look at me, Ma""."
Lenny Bruce,,"If you can take the hot lead enema, then you can cast the first stone."
Lenny Bruce,religion,"Now a Jew, in the dictionary, is one who is descended from the ancient tribes of Judea, or one who is regarded as descended from that tribe. That's what it says in the dictionary; but you and I know what a Jew is - One Who Killed Our Lord. And although there should be a statute of limitations for that crime, it seems that those who neither have the actions nor the gait of Christians, pagan or not, will bust us out, unrelenting dues, for another deuce."
Lenny Bruce,violence,"It's the suppression of the word that gives it the power, the violence, the viciousness."
Lenny Bruce,,I'm not a comedian. I'm Lenny Bruce.
Lenny Bruce,,I sort of felt sorry for the damned flies. They never hurt anybody. Even though they were supposed to carry diseases I never heard of anybody saying they caught something form a fly. My cousin gave two guys the clap and nobody ever whacked her with a paper.
Lenny Bruce,comedians,"Four years working in clubs - that's what really made it for me - every night: doing it, doing it, doing it, getting bored and doing different ways, no pressure on you, and all the other comedians are drunken bums who don't show up, so I could try anything."
Lenny Bruce,truth,"Let me tell you the truth. The truth is what is, and what should be is a fantasy. A terrible, terrible lie that someone gave to the people long ago."
Lenny Bruce,,"If Jesus had been killed twenty years ago, Catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses."
Lenny Bruce,,"What is dirty? And what is clean? Now, if I had to make a choice, man, I would rather my kid watch a stag movie than a clean movie like King of Kings. Why? Because King of Kings is full of killing and I don't want my kid to kill Christ when he comes back."
Lenny Bruce,,Every day people are straying away from the church and going back to God.
Lenny Bruce,hollywood,Children ought to watch pornographic movies: it's healthier than learning about sex from Hollywood.
Lenny Bruce,,I am influenced by every second of my waking hour.
Lenny Bruce,,There is only what is and that's it. What should be is a dirty lie.
Lenny Bruce,new york,"If I get busted in New York, the freest city in the world, that will be the end of my career."
Lenny Bruce,,I want to perform an unnatural act.
Lenny Bruce,,"I'll die young, but it's like kissing God."
Lenny Bruce,,Communism is like one big phone company.
Lenny Bruce,,"If a titty is pretty, it's dirty but not if it's bloody and maimed."
Lenny Bruce,"laws,marijuana","Marijuana will be legal someday, because the many law students who now smoke pot will one day be Congressmen and they will legalize it to protect themselves. I don't smoke pot, and I'm glad because then I can champion it without any special pleading. The reason I don't smoke pot is because it facilitates ideas and heightens sensations - and I got enough shit flying through my head without smoking pot."
Lenny Bruce,,The liberals can understand everything but people who don't understand them.
Lenny Bruce,,In the Halls of Justice the only justice is in the halls.
Lenny Bruce,,"If you believe there is a God, a God that made your body, and yet you think that you can do anything with that body that's dirty, then the fault lies with the manufacturer."
Lenny Bruce,,Life is a four-letter word.
Lenny Bruce,"truth,politics",You know there's no crooked politicians. There's never a lie because there is never any truth.

Lewis Black,rain,"Normally, in February, in Boston and in most of the country, the weather is gray, rainy, gray, sleet, gray, rain, gray, sleet, snow, gray; every day it just gets grayer and grayer and grayer! You wake up one day, and you go, 'I'm not comin' into work today!' Your boss goes, 'Why not? You sick?' 'No! It's too gray!'"
Lewis Black,,"Homeland security is a problem... Because, it's a good idea, but it's a problem, because the man who runs it is Tom Ridge. And he is someone who has the leadership qualities of... a gerbil. He was a part of coming up with what is the color coding system of security. You know, orange and yellow, and whatever the fuck the others are. OK? And what's stupid about it is they had it color-coded, like we're in fucking elementary school! There's no need for that! Because every time they tell us what the color is, then they have to fucking explain it, so get rid of the fucking color! Simplify it; there should be three levels of security: Jesus Christ, Goddammit, fuck me! "
Lewis Black,,"This is Grand Theft Auto 3. The object of this game, who cares? I'm too busy randomly hitting an old lady with a bat, carjacking a station wagon and running over people, or, my personal favorite, running over the person whose car I just stole, with the car I just stole! Now, this is a video game! Rescuing the princess is for pussies!"
Lewis Black,"religion,holidays,christmas,halloween","I will tell you, that you Christians have created a holiday that has become a beast that cannot be fed. Every year, Christmas gets longer and longer and longer, and you don't care, do you? You just take more and more of the calendar for yourself. It's unbelievable. How long does it take you people to shop?! It's beyond belief. It's insane. When I was a kid, Halloween was Halloween, and Santa wasn't poking his ass into it!"
Lewis Black,,"The people who told us about sun block were the same people who told us, when I was a kid, that eggs were good. So I ate a lot of eggs. Ten years later they said they were bad. I went, ""Well, I just ate the eggs!"" So I stopped eating eggs, and ten years later they said they were good again! Well, then I ate twice as many, and then they said they were bad. Well, now I'm really fucked! Then they said they're good, they're bad, they're good, the whites are good, th-the yellows - make up your mind! It's breakfast I've gotta eat!"
Lewis Black,opportunities,"I went to New Zealand this year, and, whew man, I know a lot of people want to go there. But let me just tell you, it's 22 hours by plane. So, if you have the opportunity, don't."
Lewis Black,,"I knew it was way too cold this winter because I have not had one thought. I have not been able to complete a sentence in my own head. I find myself wondering, going; You know, I should really - fuck it's cold! "
Lewis Black,differences,"The new millennium sucks! What a disappointment! What's the difference between the old millennium and the new millennium? Nothing! It's the same load of crap with a '2' in the front. When I was a kid, I am old enough so that when I was a kid, I looked forward to the new millennium. When I was young, I said, 'I'm gonna live through a change! A massive change! Things are gonna be different! Things are gonna be great!' Screwed again! No flying cars! No flying cars!"
Lewis Black,,"If the people of New Zealand want to be part of our world, I believe they should hop off their islands, and push 'em closer."
Lewis Black,,"And then the other CEOs would gather and they'd go, ""Who's that?"" ""Who's that? That, my friends, is my very esteemed personal ball washer. What did you guys buy? Another car? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"""

Lewis Black,"holidays,christmas,hanukkah","When you compare Christmas to Hanukkah, there's no comparison. Christmas is great. Hanukkah sucks! First night you get socks. Second night, an eraser, a notebook. It's a Back-to-School holiday!"
Lewis Black,christmas,"The best time to go to Vegas is during Christmastime, because nothing beats watching people gamble while they play Christmas carols. I'm Jewish, and I'm astonished. People going, ""Goddammit!"" ""Jesus Christ!"" ""Holy fuck!"" ""Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum, me and my drum."""
Lewis Black,teachers,"You know what they would do? They would come to my elementary school with films to show me how to protect myself from a nuclear-fuck-holocaust. They would show this giant nuclear-fucking-bomb just blowing the shit out of everything. Goats and monkeys flying everywhere. The windows of the elementary school blown out, the teacher banged up against the fucking blackboard. But there were the children... hiding safely under their desks."
Lewis Black,,"It's absolutely stupid that we live without an ozone layer. We have men, we've got rockets, we've got saran wrap - fix it!"
Lewis Black,health,"We exhaust ourselves worrying about our health. We're obsessed with it. We worry about our health and when we worry about our health, guess what? We're not fucking healthy! We're so worried about our health that we are now the fattest group of fucks on the planet Earth! ""Should I eat this or should I eat this? Well, I'll have to eat both!"""
Lewis Black,,Jesse Ventura is basically proof that the people of Minnesota are not social drinkers... they are obviously alcoholics.
Lewis Black,pope,"The Catholics have it right. I love what they do. That whole ""the pope's infallible"" thing is tremendous. Let's face facts: If you took somebody with no religious leanings whatsoever and locked that person in a psych ward with nobody around and no stimuli, the Catholic church is exactly what he'd come up with. ""Listen to this. There's this old guy in a dress, see? He wears all these great costumes and wherever he says about anything from birth control to what to watch on television, that's it, 'cause pope knows best. He can't lift his head up, but, fuck, he's a genius."""

Lewis Black,halloween,"If you are an adult, and you are planning to dress up on Halloween... don't. I will find you. I will hurt you."
Lewis Black,,Halftime at the Super Bowl is the best because halftime at the Super Bowl has gotten exponentially worse every year. I use the word 'exponentially' because I was taught it in math class and that was the first sentence I could use it in. 'Exponentially worse' means crappier and crappier and crappier.
Lewis Black,,FEMA I always thought was a bone here in your ass.
Lewis Black,advertising,"Can somebody explain to me why Pepsi and Coke advertise? Are we missing something? Seriously, everyone in this room has drank enough Pepsi and Coke in their lifetime they could piss it for a week."
Lewis Black,fishing,"I'd rather go ice fishing, which is the dumbest thing a man can do. You're sitting essentially in an out house and it's 30 below. You've cut a hole in the ice, and you're fishing for fish that you shouldn't eat, ‘cause any fish that is down there is fucking stupid."
Lewis Black,"holidays,christmas","Thanksgiving used to be Thanksgiving, and it was its own holiday, not Christmas: Part 1. When I was a kid, you ate, and you drank, and you passed out and nobody woke you up and said, 'Let's go shopping.'"

Lewis Black,,"Lactose intolerant milk? Kiss my dick! If you're lactose intolerant you can't drink milk. So what's in the fucking carton? Get it out of there, get it away from my milk. It is talking to my milk and making it feel bad about itself."
Lewis Black,,"Is milk good or bad?... I rest my case. You don't know. You don't know anymore, and a lot of you are sitting there thinking ""Fuck, I'm an adult and I don't need to drink that shit anymore!"""
Lewis Black,,"We always feel better in anticipation. You don't think about something and think ""Aw, it's gonna be shitty."" No! You say ""This is gonna be the greatest weekend ever! Sonuvabitch!"" And then, by Monday, you're throwing up and you're thinking ""You know, I always thought those guys were pricks!"""
Lewis Black,,"The amazing thing is there are people who've never left this country who talk about the fact that we're the greatest country on Earth. How fucking dumb is that?! Cuz you don't know, if you haven't left here you don't know. There are countries that may be giving shit away every day! Canada's one of those countries. You know what they give away? Health insurance!"
Lewis Black,,"There is no better moment than this moment, when we're anticipating the actual moment itself. All of the moments that lead up to the actual moment are truly the best moments. Those are the moments that are filled with good times. Those are the moments in which you are able to think that it is going to be perfect, when the moment actually happens. But, the moment is reality, and reality always kinda sucks!"
Lewis Black,golf,"I started playing golf when I was a kid, because across the street from where we lived there was a little nine-hole golf course where my father worked."
Lewis Black,,"If you're working out in front of a mirror and watching your muscles grow, your ego has reached a point where it is now eating itself. That's why I believe there should be a psychiatrist at every health club, so that when they see you doing this, they will take you away for a little chat."
Lewis Black,"coma,terrorists","It The Weather Channel is the most watched cable channel in America. I'll repeat that. It is the most watched cable channel in America. They were worried about the terrorists immobilizing us, and a portion of our countrymen watch weather. 'Kay, you don't get any more immobile than that... unless you're in a goddamn coma. That means you're saying, ""I'd go to the window, but it's too far."" If you want to know what the weather is you go to a window and stick your hand out and if you want to know what the temperature is you drive by a bank."
Lewis Black,hell,I have N'Sync and Aerosmith and Britney Spears. I have a trifecta from hell.
Lewis Black,religion,"There are things about the Jewish religion that I carry with me to this day. Chief among them is Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, as it's so happily called. It had a profound effect on my innocent young mind. The service opens with the organ playing ""Kol Nidre,"" one of the spookiest pieces of music ever written. You hear it and literally are surprised bats and shit aren't flying around."
Lewis Black,,"Nyquil comes in two colors, red and green, and it’s the only thing on the planet that tastes like red and green."

Lewis Black,teachers,I'm just so looking forward to seeing Dick Cheney because it's like the sighting of a rare white elk when he shows up. And I don't even think it's Dick Cheney anymore. We see him so rarely that I think he may be my old shop teacher.
Lewis Black,,"If you want to elect Bush, that's the prick that I'm gonna yell about. If you want to elect John Kerry, I'm gonna be yelling about him. My problem is with authority."

Lewis Black,donald trump,"Stupid presidents, smart presidents, white presidents, black presidents - doesn't work! What this country needs is a crazy Third World dictator. And Donald Trump has what it takes to be that. He's already got a plane with his name on it, solid gold buildings, a harem..."
Lewis Black,"religion,heaven","You know a religion has no sense of humor, when a guy can stand up and say, ‘you know, if you commit suicide for Allah, after you die you will be met in heaven by 70 virgins,' and nobody in the room just goes, 'Ahahaha! Son of a bitch! That was great!'"
Lewis Black,,"It has been way too cold this winter, I mean th-th-th-the temperatures have been ungodly, where the fuck is global warming when you need it! "
Lewis Black,,North Korea is the country that the monkeys in the Wizard of Oz came from.
Lewis Black,,"Here's why I think there's something a little odd with George Bush. Because a lot of the times when he speaks, his words don't match his face. Something is askew. You can't talk about the war with a smile on your face. He does it constantly. If you're the President, you should go ""We're going to talk about the war, I must have a frowny face."" The only time you can smile when you're talking about the war in Iraq is when you go, ""Well, two Iraqis walk into a bar, hahaha."""
Lewis Black,,"A father and two sons run Adelphia. It's a cable company. And they took from that company a billion dollars. A billion. Three people - three people took a billion dollars. What were they gonna do, start their own space program? 'Let's send the monkey to Mars, Dad!'"
Lewis Black,,"There are no fights in Ireland, people just get so drunk they go, ""Goddamn, ya sonofabitch!"" and pass out. And there's no Alcoholics Anonymous there, because if there's a meeting, it's always at the bar."
Lewis Black,,"The weather is out of control throughout the entire country. Where ever you go, it's 90, then it's 30, then it's 80, then it's 20, and my balls can't take it. They're big and then small. Big, small, big, small. Apparently, I can't have kids, cause my sperm are gagging."
Lewis Black,christmas,"Online, there's no time. It's always Christmas."
Lewis Black,new york,"I think comics in New York are interested in being comics. And there're comics in L.A. who are touring comics, who are certainly more interested in stand-up, but a lot of L.A. stand-ups are really looking to do something else."
Lewis Black,golf,I think one reason people play golf is it allows them to obsess about something other than the daily crap. It takes your mind off that.

Lewis Black,,Writing is thinking and thinking is hard work.
Lewis Black,"holidays,halloween","I'm not big on Halloween. I never have been. As a kid my parents would send me out to collect for UNICEF, which just screws up the whole holiday. You're wearing a costume and people are giving you pennies and you're going, ""Well, give me some candy, you fuck."" And the grown-ups tell you, ""Absolutely not. You've got your pennies. Now go build a village, you little shit."" It still brings a tear to my eye."
Lewis Black,,"If you're seeing a psychiatrist, you're wasting money because all you've got to do is get on a plane, get on a subway tomorrow and, inevitably, you're going to be seated in front of some guy who's playing with himself, and he'll be singing, 'Happy Days Are Here Again.' I tell you - when I see that guy, I feel pretty good about myself."
Lewis Black,,"I would love to have the faith to believe that the world was created in seven days... but I have thoughts... and that can really fuck up the faith thing, just ask any Catholic priest."

Lewis Black,,"If you don't drink 56 bottles of water a week, scientists say you should take a garden hose at the end of the week and shove it up your ass."
Lewis Black,hanukkah,"People believe that Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days, and that's a 'liar, liar, pants on fire' situation. Most Jewish families don't make it past the fourth day. It doesn't happen - 'Come on, aren't we going to light the lights?' 'Eh, no. Enough's enough.'"
Lewis Black,,"The thing is, whenever I see Hillary Clinton, I feel like I have to vote for her. She makes me feel guilty because I feel like I should vote for her so that she'll feel better about herself because she'd been in such a bad marriage."
Lewis Black,new york,"I knew that I'd lived in New York too long when, a few years ago, I was on a subway going downtown, and it stopped at 14th Street. At the station, the doors opened, and the conductor announced that there was a bomb on board and we should evacuate immediately. Nobody moved. We just looked at each other, 'Do you see a bomb?' 'I don't see a bomb.' 'There’s no bomb.' 'I've only got two stops - let's go for it.'"
Lewis Black,,"I don't know if watching Chaz Bono will turn your kids into transsexuals, but I'm pretty sure that letting them watch Keith Ablow will turn them into assholes."
Lewis Black,,"Why would you hire MTV to do music? MTV has nothing to do with music, ok? MTV is to music as KFC is to chicken. MTV is video, and video goes where? In your eye, music goes in your ear. Ear eye, eye ear, big fucking difference! Music is like a drug, when you hear it you have a vision, and that vision can change over time or remain the same."
Lewis Black,"sport,sex","Oral sex should be an Olympic sport because it’s harder than curling, and if you’re good at it, you deserve a medal."
Lewis Black,golf,"If I get a week off, I'll go to a hotel that has a golf course. I like to come downstairs and go right onto the course. I'll do that five days in a row."
Lewis Black,,"I believe that every paper in the country should have one headline that when you read it, you laugh so hard you can't stand it. It has to be that way. What about a headline like this: 'Hippo Eats Dwarf'? How good is that? You read that headline, and you immediately close the paper and say, 'Wow, it's gonna be a great day.'"
Lewis Black,,"And I know this happens because I took economics, and I'd explain it to ya, but I flunked that course. Not my fault. They taught it at 8 o'clock in the morning. And there is absolutely nothing you can learn out of one bloodshot eye."
Lewis Black,,"In my lifetime, we've gone from Eisenhower to George W. Bush. We've gone from John F. Kennedy to Al Gore. If this is evolution, I believe that in twelve years, we'll be voting for plants."

Lewis Black,"devil,brain","Who knew that the devil had a factory where he made millions of fossils, which his minions distributed throughout the earth, in order to confuse my tiny brain?"
Lewis Black,,"They've gotta stop reporting wind chill. That's nonsense. It really is. I don't know where they came up with it, why they came up with it, but it's a lie. They come on, ""Well, it's 27 degrees today, but with the wind chill, it's minus 3."" Well, then it's minus 3, asshole! I don't need to know what the weather was like if the conditions were perfect!"
Lewis Black,,"I would like to play Pebble Beach at some point. I keep waiting for them to call and ask me to that little pro-am thing, but I'm not big enough."

Lewis Black,religion,"That's the funny thing about religion: it doesn't matter what you say, you're going to upset someone."
Lewis Black,emotions,"In a series of wonderful essays, Evan Handler gives himself up to us - warts and all. To our amusement and bemusement we share in his emotional growth as he struggles to mature. I not only laughed along with him but felt that I too had grown a little along the way. Who could ask for more?"
Lewis Black,,"I never thought that Bill Clinton should be the president. When he was running to be the president of the United States, he said on over a hundred occasions, he said the following: He said, 'One of the great accomplishments while I was the governor of Arkansas, was to take my state in education from 50th to 49th.' And I thought, ' you know, Bill, you should keep that a secret.'"
Lewis Black,,"He smiles so much, I don't think he has a central nervous system."
Lewis Black,,"When I was nine, my life was devoted to seeing a tit. I was Captain Ahab, and it was my big white whale. I'd go down to Sears on a Sunday in hopes they'd remove a clothing from a mannequin. Sad but true, sad but fuckin' true."
Lewis Black,television,"I was on CNN in Atlanta at one o'clock in the afternoon because apparently everybody else was asleep, and they asked me what I thought of CNN and I said, ""I liked CNN until you started that writing on the bottom."" I don't know why it's there. Why do you put writing on a television set? We watch TV because we don't wanna read! We want somebody to read the shit to us so we can close our eyes and touch our nuts!"
Lewis Black,,"He's a guy who's in charge of determining our energy policy, and he's doing it with $31 million of oil company money in his pocket. Is anybody fucking home?"
Lewis Black,,"I don't know if you know about pilots. The way in which our country generates television, they take one episode, one, and then they take that episode, produce it, and show it to a room filled with monkeys. And if the monkeys don't shit themselves, you might have a hit!"
Lewis Black,"health,new york","Health clubs aren't healthy. In New York City, which has the most stairs of anywhere in the country, people pay money to go to a health club and use a stair master. When you live in a city, that has nothing but stairs and you pay money to use special stairs, that is not healthy behavior. It's fucking psychotic!"
Lewis Black,,There are packs of baboons running around Africa that take better care of themselves than we do. You know what health insurance is for me? I've got Band-Aids in my car.
Lewis Black,"religion,parents,hanukkah","I have no religion because I was born and raised Jewish. And on the first night of Hanukkah, my parents, when I was very young, gave me a top to play with. They called it a dreidel. I knew it was a top. And as I looked at that top, I said, 'You know. I don't think I'm gonna be Jewish for very long.'"
Lewis Black,,"People go to Vegas, and they don't know what to do; here's what you do. You go to the casino in your hotel. On your arrival, you get $100 in quarters. Take that $100 back to your hotel room and stare at it for a long, long time. Why? Because you're never going to see them again. Then you take those quarters to the bathroom and you flush them, one by one by one. And the nice thing about that is that every so often the toilet will back up, and you'll feel like a winner! "
Lewis Black,new york,"I love New York City. The reason I live in New York City is because it's the loudest city on the planet Earth. It's so loud I never have to listen to any of the shit that's going on in my own head. It's really loud. They literally have guys come with jackhammers and they drill the streets and just leave cones in front of your apartment; you don't even know why. Garbage men come; they don't pick up the garbage, they just bang the cans together. And if your block's too quiet, they actually hire a guy who wanders around going, ""Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!"" ... That was the first job I ever had."
Lewis Black,,"Because when you say ""shit"", it makes them cry. ""Why didn't he say 'poopie'? Why didn't he say 'poopie'?"""

Lewis Black,holidays,"Valentine's Day: the holiday that reminds you that if you don't have a special someone, you're alone."
Lewis Black,care,"I don't care who wins because I go to sporting events to scream. It's the one place on the planet you can shout anything you want. You can bellow at will, and nobody will bother you. I yell things like, 'My life sucks! Dan Quayle is a schmuck! If I don't have sex soon, I'm going to explode!' Parents turn to their kids as I leave the stadium and go, 'Hey, there goes a great fan.'"
Lewis Black,,iPod now has music on a fucking credit card. Eventually they'll have it so that you wear underwear and you just hear it in your head.
Lewis Black,,"But what about the children, Lewis? I can hear some of you asking. What about the children? It's more disturbing to hear adults talking about having seen a tit as shocking and disturbing and indecent than it is for children to see one."
Lewis Black,,"Whenever someone says they believe the earth was created in 7 days, I grab a fossil and say, ""Fossil."" And if they keep talking, I throw it just over their heads."

Lewis Black,men,"Wise men say that time is like a river. I say time is like a river of shit... and as you float down that river in your little canoe, your paddles are getting smaller and smaller."
Lewis Black,,"I don't believe pumpkin pie is even made from pumpkin. I mean, how can something that smells that shitty make a pie so sweet? There's not enough sugar in the universe."

Lewis Black,family,Everybody's family has different values.
Lewis Black,language,"""Equestrian,"" by the by, is the gayest word in the English language. In fact, I thought ""Brokeback Mountain"" should have been called ""Two Equestrians."""
Lewis Black,,N'Sync and Aerosmith are two bands that don't even belong in the same state as each other!
Lewis Black,,They should have a store next to the bookstore called the shit store where you can get shit books to read while on the shitter. No one reads great literature on the shitter.
Lewis Black,,"Apparently there is no profit in the unique, or not enough to make it worthwhile to preserve. Ultimately it drains the life out of us, and existentialism starts to make more and more sense."
Lewis Black,,Now I must leave you as you enter the world that is Fuck. You are fucking lucky to be here. It's almost utopian.
Lewis Black,,"Anybody who likes writing a book is an idiot. Because it's impossible, it's like having a homework assignment every stinking day until it's done. And by the time you get it in, it's done and you're sitting there reading it, and you realize the 12,000 things you didn't do. I mean, writing isn't fun. It's never been fun. It's momentum, and once you get the momentum going, that's great, but it's a brutal experience in many, many ways. And when you're done, people tell you ""Well, gee, I'm not interested."" ""Great, I'm glad I sat down and wrote this!"""
Lewis Black,,If you stop eating donuts you will live 3 years longer. It's just 3 more years that you want a donut.
Lewis Black,,"They're so broke that they've actually cut essential services. In many places, they've cut policemen, because, who the fuck needs them? Or firemen, son of a bitch, it's much more fun watching something burn down."
Lewis Black,,"Americans continue to rapidly homogenize ourselves into a neutered oblivion. For a country founded on the protection of the unique, we relish our sameness."
Lewis Black,dancing,We are all shitty little snowflakes dancing in the universe.
Lewis Black,,"If you ask your congressman why, he'll say Because it's hard. It's really hard. Makes me want to go poopie. You know why we don't have solar energy? It's because the sun goes away each day, and it doesn't tell us where it's going!"
Lewis Black,,"You ever read the ingredients in sunblock? I've never seen those words anywhere. You don't even know what you're putting on your face, do you? You go, ""Oh no, the sun's out!"" It could be zebra cum; you don't know. You may not like that joke, but you don't know."
Lewis Black,holidays,"The whole Valentine's thing is fine, but you don't back it up right next to the biggest gift-giving holiday of the year. Unbelievable. And we find it acceptable."

Lewis Black,,"I've seen the end of the universe, and it happens to be in the United States and, oddly enough, it's in Houston, Texas. I know - I was shocked, too. Imagine my surprise when I left a comedy club one day and walked to the end of the block, and there on one corner was a Starbucks, and across the street from that Starbucks, in the exact same building as that Starbucks, there was - a Starbucks. I looked back and forth, thinking the sun was playing tricks with my eyes. That there was a Starbucks across from a Starbucks - and that, my friends, is the end of the universe."

Lewis Black,drugs,"While I was in Miami, they stole my rental car, because apparently, they didn't have enough time to load up a gun and shoot me. On the street, there was a Lexus, a BMW, and in the middle was my car; the rental car. The Plymouth Horizon. Here's a math problem for you, don't ponder it too long or your head'll explode, but how many drugs would you have to consume, in what period of time, to be on the street and go, ""Well, I gotta have the Horizon! Are you kidding me? I've never driven a car that's aqua!"""
Lewis Black,,"If you really think there's a Santa, why don't you sit on the front steps all night in the freezing cold and see if he climbs down any chimneys tonight. Good luck. And since we're a family that isn't lucky enough to have a chimney, how would Santa get into our house? Does he bring a locksmith with him? And it probably would have to be a Jewish locksmith, because a Christian locksmith is going to want to be home with his family. And how many Jewish locksmiths are there? None."
Lewis Black,"dinosaurs,museums","There are people who believe that humans dinosaurs co-existed, that they roamed the Earth at the same time. There are museums that children go to, in which they build dioramas to show them this. And what this is, purely and simply, is a clinical psychotic reaction. They are crazy. They are stone-cold-fuck nuts. I can't be kind about this, because these people are watching The Flinstones as if it were a documentary."
Lewis Black,,"Earth Day was created because we were doing a lot of drugs, more drugs than you could ever imagine. And so we came up with Earth Day, so we'd have one day that would remind us what planet we were living on."

Louie Anderson,,I have a very warm spot in my heart for Vegas.

Louie Anderson,,"I have a cousin Ernie who buys stuff. He's got a big snowblower that's actually the biggest snowblower you can buy, with a remote control, so he doesn't even have to go outside. He's got the microwave and a satellite dish, it's all in one. He cooks and watches at the same time."
Louie Anderson,,"Dr. Phil was very helpful and caring. I believe he helped all of us there and watching how to better relate, understand, and communicate with our families and loved ones. Dr. Phil recommended reading my new book."
Louie Anderson,,It's so much easier to be cynical.
Louie Anderson,,"I'm a 7 o'clock act. My people want to go to a show, a dinner and then go home and go to bed."
Louie Anderson,,"My mom was a garage sale person, save money. Come on in to the garage sale, you might find a shirt. She'd get in that garage sale and point stuff out to you. There's a good fork for a nickel. Yeah, that's beautiful. It's a little high. If it were three cents I'd snap it up."
Louie Anderson,,"I've been in Vegas. That's where you get into the money thing. Boy, you get greedy in Vegas, you know. That's the only place that you can bet $25, get it up to $500 and refuse to quit."
Louie Anderson,,I felt ashamed for what I had done. I don't have any excuses. I did what I did. I take full responsibility for myself and my actions. I wouldn't pawn this off on anybody. I'm sorry it happened. And I hurt people.
Louie Anderson,inspiration,My inspiration is coming more and more from the way I feel and the gratitude I feel. The older you get the more humility you have.
Louie Anderson,,"After 34 years, I feel like I did when I was starting out. I feel excited and feel I've never been better doing what I do."
Louie Anderson,,I have added a lot. There's some Vegas stuff and hotel stuff and a whole chunk on health.
Louie Anderson,california,"I live in California, the worst place in the world for fat people. There are three of us. They have us on eight-hour shifts, so it works out."
Louie Anderson,,"Credit-card debt and day trading-I feel like Michael Corleone in Godfather III, just when I think out, they pull me back in."
Louie Anderson,,I started a big part of my career in Vegas.
Louie Anderson,,"My first words were ""Seconds, please"". Most kids in kindergarten napped on a little rug. I had a braided 9x12."
Louie Anderson,,"You have to be funny about it and honest about it. You can't leave yourself out of that mix. You have to be honest enough to say, I'm that messed-up one in the family."
Louie Anderson,,We were on welfare when we were kids. Thanks for reminding me of that.
Louie Anderson,,We all think we're going to get out of debt.
Louie Anderson,,"Minnesotans really think they run the whole world, I love that."
Louis C. K.,,"Every day starts, my eyes open and I reload the program of misery. I open my eyes, remember who I am, what I'm like, and I just go, 'Ugh'."
Louis C. K.,,"I like pressure. Pressure doesn't make me crack. It's enabling. I eat pressure, and there might be times when I get a bad feeling in my gut that this might be too much, but you feel pressure when you're not doing something, you know?"
Louis C. K.,decisions,"You know, the people who do indie film and decide who gets those little budgets? They're mean, man. They're cold and very cool-oriented."
Louis C. K.,,Perception is created and twisted so quickly.
Louis C. K.,,"Nice to be here. I had a good day today I went to a movie. Before the movie now they show you that presentation where they explain that you shouldn't download movies on the Internet because you're hurting all the people that work on them. They need to feed their families so you shouldn't download the movies. And I saw this and I thought, ""Wow, I had no idea. I didn't know you could download movies on the Internet... I don't care about those people."""
Louis C. K.,,"I find that when people laugh it's usually because they're connecting and identifying in a way that they hadn't considered. That's my payoff. I'm not interested in other people thinking differently. I don't care. I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, ""I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives""."
Louis C. K.,,"I don't believe in this idea of, 'That's hate speech, stop it.'"
Louis C. K.,masturbation,"I ate too much and masturbated too recently, you know? It's bad to like jerk off and run out the door, 'cause you run into somebody. ""Oh, she knows..."" You got to take some time alone to process the shame."
Louis C. K.,heaven,"I wish I could know everything ever, like that would be my wish - that's what I hope heaven is, that they tell you who shot JFK and all that stuff."
Louis C. K.,,"My uncles were all funny. My dad wasn’t funny, but my uncles were all funny. Now I go back and I like him better than them, they were manipulative funny."
Louis C. K.,,It's just a big excuse to say awful things.
Louis C. K.,,"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time, and if you don't give up, you will get better."
Louis C. K.,,"Last week I got a flu that I caught, 'cause my daughter coughed … into my mouth."
Louis C. K.,,It’s been a very old thing for people to gather together and laugh at stuff. The first comedian in America really was Abraham Lincoln. He used to go to a pub near where he lived and stand in front of the fire and he packed the place every night and he would just talk and bust everybody in their guts. He was just a hilarious speaker and that’s what he did.
Louis C. K.,,"Sometimes I just want to tell a story regardless of whether it fits what the show is saying. I’ve been in a lot of writing rooms where somebody says an idea and everyone’s dying, like laughing so they’re delirious. It’s like a black hole in a good way, everything starts to fall into it, you know what I mean."
Louis C. K.,"attitude,love,family","Fuck it... That's really the attitude that keeps a family together, it's not ""we love each other"", it's just ""fuck it, man."""
Louis C. K.,,I thought about going to NYU film school - that was this ideal to me. But I didn't make any kind of grades in high school.
Louis C. K.,,"You have to be really tenacious. You have to keep at it. There are many roads to get there. If you can get yourself into Harvard, that’s a good way to go, because every Harvard graduating class, the agencies come trolling around and they’ll look for you. So if you go to Harvard, you’ll get found there."
Louis C. K.,,"I don’t feel those limits when I’m on stage. For some reason, audiences let me get away with things. Remember, it’s all comedy. Words. Thoughts. All thoughts are safe and worth exploring."
Louis C. K.,,Everybody is different. Some comedy is more musical like Steven Wright. His is a pillar of comedy to me. He invented a whole form and all his jokes are poems. So it's different. I wanted to do it like George Carlin. Now I do it like me.
Louis C. K.,,"I just don't trust any of it. Every time I read something about how there's been another ridiculous climb of the Dow Jones, there's a part of me that goes, “This can't be good.” None of this is real money. You know what I mean? It's not like there's actually more of anything. It's just ideas. When people are getting richer and richer but they're not actually producing anything, it can't end well."
Louis C. K.,,"I thought for like five years that when you have sex, you come and one of your balls comes out. That's what I thought happened, that you have to come a ball out of that little whole at the tip of your dick. I was terrified! That's what I thought, you just... Bahh! And you push a ball out and she's screaming and there's blood everywhere...and you can only do it twice and then you're out of balls. That's what I thought. You come and have two babies, and then you just walk around with an empty sack for the rest of your life. Which turned out to be true..."
Louis C. K.,"brain,alaska","I can't sit down and write jokes. I just flows in from some maddeningly elusive place. Believe me, if I had an Alaska in my brain, I would drill baby drill, and I'd cum right on Sarah's back while I was there."
Louis C. K.,,"I always tell my kids to cut a sandwich in half right when you get it, and the first thought you should have is somebody else. You only ever need half a burger."
Louis C. K.,,It's really the kids that do you in. We have two kids. That's fucking stupid. Don't do that.
Louis C. K.,,"I’ve always benefited from knowing machines well, because it’s freedom, it gives you freedom, I always knew that."
Louis C. K.,questions,"If you study something and you find all this stuff about it, you just went skin deep, so if you keep going and going, you should be left with a fucking mess of unanswered questions."
Louis C. K.,,"I don’t know if you’ve ever had just five dollars in the bank, but I’ve found that if that’s all you have, you can’t get it out."
Louis C. K.,"kids,parents",Very few American parents give a crap about how they raise their kids. They put minimal effort into it. Who told you it’s a good idea to buy a developing mind a video game?
Louis C. K.,arguments,"Nobody ever wins an argument. Nobody ever goes, 'Oh, I'm wrong.' Somebody eventually just goes, 'Shut up. We gotta eat, so let's shut up for minute.'"
Louis C. K.,hate,"I hate when people ask me the time on the street 'cause something happens to me. I just panic. I can't read my watch. When I'm alone, I'm great at reading my watch, but when someone asks me, I just have this anxiety attack, and I just can't make it out... I always end up saying something useless, like, 'It's 20 of 9:40.'"
Louis C. K.,dating,"I did that on a date once - I was wearing a bathing suit under my pants because I didn't do laundry. She wouldn't have known except for I had that white string flapping outside of my fly. She was like, 'What do you have - a tampon in there? What the hell's wrong with you?' "
Louis C. K.,attitude,"That's a very white attitude. You can take a white guy to Africa, and he'd be like, 'Look at all the minorities they got over here. Jesus!'"
Louis C. K.,,I think the idea of fucking someone who just watched you perform is... it's just not me.
Louis C. K.,"stupidity,respect","If you do something and people think you're stupid, just go for crazy. You get more respect that way because nobody likes stupid people."
Louis C. K.,boxing,I do actually use a boxing trainer when I train for stand-up.
Louis C. K.,"people,care","I used to like people more, but now I have children and that changes your life in a lot of ways. Like you spend time with people you never would have chosen to spend time with, not in a million years. I spend whole days with people, I'm like, ""I never would have hung out with you. I didn't choose you. Our children chose each other based on no criteria by the way. They're the same size. They don't care who they make me hang out with."""
Louis C. K.,,"I've had two great years, probably five good years. So I had 20 years of just kind of uncertainty and suffering and ego destruction and poverty. All these things. There's no way I'm ever going to catch up to the misery years. It's impossible... If I don't do anything dumb or I don't get a disease or something, and then I've got to five to eight years I think where it'll really be great and then it will start to degenerate like uranium, you know?"
Louis C. K.,,"I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, ""I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives."""
Louis C. K.,,"When you're a father in a marriage, you sort of become the mother's assistant. And you sort of get a list from her every day and you run down the list and it feels very much like a chore."
Louis C. K.,"dreams,baseball","Bill Gates has 90 billion dollars. If I had 90 billion dollars, I wouldn't have it for long because I would just dream of all the crazy stuff I could do with it. This guy, 90 billion dollars. He could buy every baseball team and make them all wear dresses and still have 88 billion dollars."
Louis C. K.,,"I grew up in Boston, and in Boston, people just beat the shit out of each other for no reason. They just beat the shit out of each other. But I kinda think you need that to keep quality control 'cause in places where it doesn't have it, they're too free."
Louis C. K.,,"Look, it's some cunt coming out of that cunt's cunt."
Louis C. K.,"religion,attitude","It's in the Ten Commandments to not take the Lord's name in vain. Rape isn't up there, by the way. Rape is not a Ten Commandment. But don't say the dude's name with a shitty attitude."
Louis C. K.,,"'I had to sit on the runway for 40 minutes.' Oh my god, really? What happened then, did you fly through the air like a bird, incredibly? Did you soar into the clouds, impossibly? Did you partake in the miracle of human flight and then land softly on giant tires that you couldn't even conceive how they fucking put air in them? You're sitting in a chair in the sky. You're like a Greek myth right now. "
Louis C. K.,"9/11,masturbation","You can figure out how bad a person you are by how soon after September 11th you masturbated, like how long you waited... and for me it was between the two buildings going down... I had to do it, otherwise they'd win."
Louis C. K.,,I like all ladies of all different ages.
Louis C. K.,new york,"One time, I threw a candy wrapper on the street. I was with a friend who said to me, ""You just littered on the street! Don't you care about the environment?"" And I thought about it, and I said, ""You know what? This isn't the environment. This is New York City. New York City is not the environment. New York City is a giant piece of litter. Next to Mexico City, it's the shittiest piece of litter in the world. Just a pussy, runny, smokin', stinkin' piece of litter."
Louis C. K.,hate,I don't stop eating when I'm full. The meal isn't over when I'm full. It's over when I hate myself.
Louis C. K.,stuff,"I like being full, every day, with stuff that I have to do."
Louis C. K.,,I love comedians. They're my community.
Louis C. K.,"life,drugs",Drugs are so fucking good that they'll ruin your life.
Louis C. K.,sex,I'm pretty sure 100% of animal sex is rape. It's just all rape.
Louis C. K.,"wife,dreams","Well, my wife assassinated my sexual identity, and my children are eating my dreams. We don't bother you with that. We just say ""Great."""
Louis C. K.,,I'm a good citizen. I'm a good father. I recycle and I masturbate.
Louis C. K.,,I spend enough time onscreen looking hangdog and depressed.
Louis C. K.,"women,kids","When girls go wild, they show their tits to people. When women go wild, they kill men and drown their kids in a tub."
Louis C. K.,,I think one reason TV has always done well is because there is something comforting where you kind of know what you're going to be taken through.
Louis C. K.,"people,hate","I've started to kind of hate people, and it's not because I have anything against them. It's just, I enjoy it. It's recreation."
Louis C. K.,,"I have a crazy amount of different jobs, so the way I manage that is to not do more than one at a time. It's like old computers that had small memory chips, they would do something called swapping, where they would fill the memory with one task, do it and get it out."
Louis C. K.,,"There's a woman I see who's not my therapist, but she's like an old friend who's a therapist in profession. She lets me talk to her like a therapist once in a while, and she does a great thing. Whenever I have a big dilemma, like this is a big problem in my life, she always says, 'Wow, you're going to have to figure that out.'"
Louis C. K.,gays,"Gay men have to go through something to own their - who they are. They get beat up. They get ostracized. Whatever they go through, if they survive it, they come out very confident people."
Louis C. K.,,A very painful part of being a parent is having really negative feelings about your children when you love them so much.
Louis C. K.,,"Well, when I was younger, I lied all the time, because once you understand the power of lying, it's really like magic because you transform reality for people."
Louis C. K.,,My kids are really easy. I often worry that they're too easy to deal with. They're really nice people.
Louis C. K.,,"I got tits now, too. I just got tits! That is a fucked up day in a man's life, when you look in the mirror and you realize, ""Fuck! I got..."" Because you don't see them coming, they're sort of pouting out little by little, and then one day they just fuckin' fall a little and that's it, you have tits. And they're there for good. They're not gonna like go back, it's fucking over. "
Louis C. K.,,"Anytime you see a bit where some stranger does something to me, it's me."
Louis C. K.,"arguments,driving","I was driving in Manhattan. There's traffic, nobody's moving... The guy behind me is honking just at me. He kept yelling at me. I decided that I'm gonna argue with this guy, but I'm gonna argue about something else. I'm not having his argument; I'm having mine. So, he's like, 'Go!' And I go, 'Well give me back my jacket!' And he stopped. I was like, 'Yeah, you got my jacket! Give it back! I said you could borrow it, not have it! You're stretching it out, you fat pig! Give it back, now!' He got back in his car, and he locked his doors."
Louis C. K.,,"Comedians work great as actors because they're good under pressure. With a lot of actors, you have to make them feel like everything's going really well to get a good performance out of them. But, if you have a comedian on the set, you can tell them, 'Hey, you really are screwing this up,' and then they just get better."
Louis C. K.,,"For my scale, how I grew up and live my life, I'm making plenty of money."
Louis C. K.,,I do feel a lot of times like I'm out of my league with my kids in terms of what my responsibility is.

Louis C. K.,,I know what it's like to have a bunch of material that's working that you don't care about. You want to die.
Louis C. K.,,"I'm not condoning rape, obviously. You should never rape anyone. Unless you have a reason like you want to fuck somebody and they won't let you, in which case what other option do you have? How else are you supposed to have an orgasm in their body if you don't rape them, like what the fuck?"
Louis C. K.,"men,women","A man will cut your arm off and throw it in a river, but he'll leave you as a human being intact. He won't fuck with who you are. Women are non-violent, but they will shit inside of your heart."
Louis C. K.,politics,I'm not a political comedian. That's just not what I do.
Louis C. K.,,"I've never sucked a dick. Isn't that weird? My whole life! That's weird to me. It is! It's weird. Because almost everybody has sucked a dick, when you think about it, most people on earth suck dicks. It's true. Because 51% of the population are women and they suck dicks. Then there's all the gay guys who suck dicks. Then there's all the straight guys who have been forced to suck a dick under various circumstances. So there's only like a thousand of us out there who never blew anyone. Just a bunch of selfish assholes that are fuckin' gettin' blown and not blowin' back, you know."
Louis C. K.,success,"People get successful and they start saying, 'Well of course I am! I was chosen! I'm special!' No, you're not."
Louis C. K.,,"I have a lot of beliefs and I live by none of 'em. That's just the way I am. They're just my beliefs. I just like believing them. I like that part. They're my little ""believies."" They make me feel good about who I am. But if they get in the way of a thing I want, or I want to jack off or something, I fuckin' do that."
Louis C. K.,,"You've got to be optimistic to be single. Stupid. You have to be stupid. That's what optimistic means, you know. It means stupid. An optimist is someone who goes, ""Hey, maybe something nice will happen!"" Why the fuck would anything nice ever happen?! What are you stupid?!"
Louis C. K.,,Some entertainers don't pay attention to what's going on around them.
Louis C. K.,,Sometimes I try to take a nap before shows. That clears my head.
Louis C. K.,comedians,There's no real preparing at home for stand-up. You just go and you just do it.
Louis C. K.,,"Farts are - I just refuse to be snobbish about certain shit with comedy. You know, farts come out of your ass and they make a fucking trumpet sound. That shit smelling gas comes out of your ass and it makes a toot sound. What the fuck is not funny about that? It’s perfect, it’s a perfect joke. It has all the elements."
Louis C. K.,,"To me, it's very exhilarating when somebody else does a great thing, and it's not me."
Louis C. K.,,"When I am in a hotel, and I turn off the lights and the TV, I just freak out. I turn the TV back on and don't get any sleep."

Louis C. K.,hitler,Most people are dead. Hitler. Ray Charles. Some other guys. But mostly those two.

Louis C. K.,,You can't direct without a good crew.
Louis C. K.,television,Television for a child creates such a high bar of stimulus that nothing else competes. A beautiful day is absolute crap to a kid who watches tv.
Louis C. K.,,"Life's too short to be an asshole, as an employer or as an employee."
Louis C. K.,,"All these words we use, anybody can be a genius now. It used to be you had to have a thought no one ever had before or you had to invent a number. Now, it's like, ""Hey, I've got a cup in case we need another cup."" ""Dude, you're a genius!"""
Louis C. K.,,My dick is too aware that your pussy is a chamber of financial ruin!
Louis C. K.,,People don't talk to me on airplanes.
Louis C. K.,airports,"I'm buying a Cinnabon … at the airport … I arrived at. You understand why that's extra disgusting, right? Because when you're at the airport you're leaving from, you can say, ""Oh, I gotta eat. I need some food, because I might be trapped in the sky forever, so I should eat right now."" But I've landed. The trip is over. I'm 20 minutes from my house, where I got bananas and apples and shit. And I'm sitting on my luggage just fucking eating a Cinnabon with a fork and knife."
Louis C. K.,"white people,problems","We have white people problems in America. That's what we have, white people problems. You know what that is? That's where your life is amazing, do you just make shit up to be upset about. People in other countries have real problems. Like, ""Oh, shit. They're cutting off all our heads today."" Things like that. Here, we make shit up to be upset about. Like, ""How come I have to choose a language on the ATM machine? It's bullshit. I shouldn't have to do that. I'm American."""

Louis C. K.,,"If I do something for my kids, I get a medal, because most fathers don't."
Louis C. K.,divorce,"Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird, but it's true because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce … That would be sad. If two people were married and they were really and they just had a great thing and then they got divorced, that would be really sad. But that has happened zero times."
Louis C. K.,"school,dreams","I did a show in New Jersey in the auditorium of a technical high school. Technical high school, that's where dreams are narrowed down. We tell our children, ""You can do anything you want."" Their whole lives. ""You can do anything!"" But this place, we take kids - they're 15, they're young - and we tell them, ""You can do eight things. We got it down to eight for you."""
Louis C. K.,life,People say 'my phone sucks.' No it doesn't! The shittiest cellphone in the world is a miracle. Your life sucks. Around the phone.
Louis C. K.,,"It's like Platoon. You've got all this fucking stuff; you have an impossible amount of shit to carry, and usually, a kid sometimes too. And I see parents all over the place with skinny little ankles and, you know, with no particular features and they just, life's worn them down to a basic like human shape, you know. Their personality and whatever they, the lines in their face and the chiseling is gone. They're just this thing and it's like ant strength, and you just have to, you just have to do it to get through whatever fucking, you know, we've got to get from here to there.

Louis C. K.,,"Oh, I love stand-up."
Louis C. K.,"religion,atheism","I'm not an atheist. I think god is there and that he is watching and he made us. I just don't give a shit. I don't ""believe in god."" I have zero idea how everything got here. I would personally say that, if i had to make a list of possibles, God would be pretty far down. But if I were to make a list of people that know what the fuck they are talking about, I would be really far down."

Louis C. K.,,"When I read things like ""the foundations of capitalism are shattering,"" I'm like, maybe we need that. Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey with pots clanging on the sides. Because everything is amazing right now and nobody's happy... In my lifetime, the changes in the world have been incredible. Now we live in an amazing, amazing world and it's wasted on the crappiest generation of just spoiled idiots that don't care, because this what people are like now. They've got their phone and they're like ""Uh, it won't"" Give it a second! It's going to space! Can you give it a second to get back from space? Is the speed of light too slow for you?"
Louis C. K.,,"First of all, I came immediately, and also I started farting as I came. That's how my sex life started. Fucking shame and depression."
Louis C. K.,,It's a positive thing to talk about terrible things and make people laugh about them.
Louis C. K.,,"If you're a cartoon character or most TV characters, sure, you'll fight, because the punches are juicy-sounding and they don't leave marks. But in real life, if somebody punches you in the eye, it doesn't make any noise and your eye is swollen for, like, six months. It's a nightmare to get punched in the eye."
Louis C. K.,new york,"Plenty of crazy people in New York. There are so many crazy people here, I think it's like one out of every one person is completely out of their mind."
Louis C. K.,"twitter,motivation","I'm not motivated to entertain people through Twitter, so just by having Twitter and not saying anything, I make people mad."

Louis C. K.,,"Sorry, Americans only buy things that come from suffering. They just enjoy it more when they know someones getting hurt."
Louis C. K.,,"I like to talk to strangers. I like to go up to people I don't know and just start conversations with them, just start a conversation. Try it. But the way I do it, don't start the conversation in the beginning, just start it in the middle. Try it. Just go up to somebody you don't know and and just go, 'Well how do you think I felt?'"
Louis C. K.,racism,"Why can't we have racism that's ignorant but nice? You could have stereotypes that are positive about race. You could say, ""Those Chinese people, they can fly!"" ""You know about the Puerto Ricans... they're made of candy!"""
Louis C. K.,,"When I read things like the foundations of capitalism are shattering, I'm like, maybe we need that. Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey with pots clanging on the sides."

Louis C. K.,death,"You're all gonna die. Then you'll be dead for way longer than you're alive, like that's mostly what you're ever gonna be. You're just dead people that didn't die yet."
Louis C. K.,,How many advantages can one person have? I'm a white man!
Louis C. K.,"jail,dogs","I really think it's crazy that we hit our kids. It really is. Here's the crazy part about it. Kids are the only people in the world that you're allowed to hit. Do you realize that? They're the most vulnerable and they're the most destroyed by being hit, but it's totally OK to hit them. And they're the only ones! If you hit a dog, they fucking will put you in jail for that shit."
Louis C. K.,"truth,friends",Friends should always tell you the truth. But please don’t.
Louis C. K.,,"The earliest stand-up comedy I was aware of was Bill Cosby. I watched Saturday Night Live as soon as I was aware of it, and Monty Python used to be on PBS at weird hours, so I used to try to watch that. And I loved George Carlin on SNL, that was the first stand-up I ever really remember seeing on TV. And then Steve Martin. I guess I was in fifth or sixth grade when Steve Martin showed up, and he was instantly my idol. And Richard Pryor around the same time too, I sort of became aware of him, though I don’t remember the first time I saw him."
Louis C. K.,,I would rather be with my kids than anybody else.
Louis C. K.,"attitude,new york","I read something in the paper that really confused me the other day. It said that 80 percent of the people in New York are minorities... Shouldn't you not call them minorities when they get to be 80 percent of the population? That's a very white attitude, don't you think? I mean, you could take a white guy to Africa and he'd be like 'Look at all the minorities around here! I'm the only majority.'"
Louis C. K.,,"I think you have to try and fail, because failure gets you closer to what you're good at."
Louis C. K.,,I definitely look at my body and I go: 'Yuck.'
Louis C. K.,audience,"I can feel how an audience is reacting when I’m on a stage, but when you are on stage, your perception is distorted. That’s something you just have to know. It’s like pilots that fly at high Gs and they lose, sometimes, consciousness and hand/eye coordination and they just have to know that that’s going to happen. They have to be trained to not try to do too much while they are doing that. So when you are on stage, you have to be aware that you are wrong about how it feels a lot of times."
Louis C. K.,decisions,"There's two kinds of press that you get when you put out a TV show: The reviews, and the people that just decide what the reviews say."
Louis C. K.,,"The thing is, comedy's gone in a weird direction. People are really into ironic comedy and fakeness and cleverness."
Louis C. K.,,The only pitch I have to movie people is the same as this one: Just give me $8 million. I'm not telling you what it's about and I'm not telling you who's in it.
Louis C. K.,,"Pushing the envelope' sort of implies that you're inside the envelope with everyone else, and you're trying to find the edges on the outsides."
Louis C. K.,,I'm enjoying the work while I get it right now.
Louis C. K.,,"Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I'm very suspicious. It doesn't make sense to me that you'd have the same solution to every issue."
Louis C. K.,,"Comedy isn't polite and it isn't correct and it isn't accurate, even. It's just a mess. So that's the way that I approach it."
Louis C. K.,men,"If you're a woman and a guy's ever said anything romantic to you, he just left off the second part that would have made you sick if you could have heard it."
Louis C. K.,obama,I really love Barack Obama. Sorry if that’s like “Ew. The president. That’s lame.” I love Barack Obama. What a great man. I’m so lucky to have voted for that guy.
Louis C. K.,family,America's a family. We all yell at each other. It all works out.
Louis C. K.,,"The Jackass movies are honestly some of the best movies I've ever seen. I laugh so hard at them. Those guys are geniuses. If they had grown up with a different group of people, they could've been performance artists at Bard College, and people would be writing papers about them."
Louis C. K.,,"Well, I think ""likability"" is an overused word. I don’t watch people 'cause I like them; I watch them because they’re compelling. Sympathetic is a little different. Likable just thins you out. Working to make a character likable is what kills most TV shows."
Louis C. K.,,I'd love to have a shitty job. I couldn't hold any down. Standup was the only thing I could stick with. I'm an idiot that way.
Louis C. K.,"driving,football","The last jobs I had were fixing cars and covering football games for a local access TV station. As in driving the mobile van to the field, setting up 3 cameras, teaching depressed grownups and interns how to use them and directing the game from the van and then wanting to kill myself."
Louis C. K.,audience,Being popular with an audience is a very rickety ladder to be on.
Louis C. K.,care,"I don't care about the weight. You know, I'm lucky; I'm one of those people - I can eat donuts, whatever, and I just get fat."
Louis C. K.,,I could never sit down and write jokes.
Louis C. K.,,"Breaking records is not something you expect to be doing. That's like a sports thing, it's not usually a comedy and writing thing."
Louis C. K.,christmas,"One thing I learned from drinking is that if you ever go Christmas caroling, you should go with a group of people. And also go sometime in December."
Louis C. K.,"money,kids",Being single at 41 after ten years of marriage and two kids is difficult. That’s like having a bunch of money in the currency of a country that doesn’t exist anymore.
Louis C. K.,dating,"Dating is horrible, it's awful. I don't get it. It's like you're standing there: 'Hi. Do you want to have sex and later wish you hadn't?' It's horrible. And it's awkward at 42 because I don't have the body or the drive. I just sit in the car and hope somebody gets in."
Louis C. K.,kids,"I don't like waking up. I feel like staying in bed usually, but I can't because I've got two kids standing next to my bed, just eager to live another day."
Louis C. K.,,"After you do standup for for, like, five years, you're kind of screwed because you have no other skills. You can't get other jobs. It's like being in prison: you're not suitable for any other career."
Louis C. K.,,"I've had, what, two years? Probably five good years. Before that I had twenty years of uncertainty and suffering and ego destruction and poverty. All those things. That'll always outweigh the good times."
Louis C. K.,girlfriends,God is like a shitty girlfriend.
Louis C. K.,new york,"I like New York. This is the only city where you actually have to say things like, 'Hey, that's mine. Don't pee on that.'"
Louis C. K.,,"Technically, I've learned that having good legs and wind is good for being on stage. You have to be in shape and have endurance."
Louis C. K.,,"The problem is, the more famous you get, the more people see you who didn't choose to."
Louis C. K.,,"There's been a lot of simple vilification of right-wing people. It's really easy to say, 'Well, you're Christian, you're anti-this and that, and I hate you.' But to me, it's more interesting to say, 'What is this person like and how do they really think?'"
Louis C. K.,divorce,"When I got divorced, I thought 'Well, there goes my act.'"
Louis C. K.,"kids,future","When two kids are being completely berserk, and they're naked and throwing food around, sometimes I just let it go because I can see a future where they're going to be dressed, and they're going to be at school. So I kind of let stuff go sometimes."
Louis C. K.,audience,You have to be aware of who you're talking to in an audience.
Louis C. K.,9/11,"Even after 9/11, during the darkest moment of our recent history, the President told us, “Go shopping.” That's how we were told to uphold American values; go out and fucking buy more shit. So what were we supposed to do?"
Louis C. K.,"dating,divorce","When I was first divorced, I started dating younger women, and it was really exciting. But after a while I was like, 'This is just dumb.'"
Louis C. K.,,"Most people are dead. Did you know that? It's true, out of all the people that ever were, almost all of them are dead."
Louis C. K.,,Life is full of horrible mistakes.
Louis C. K.,,"A lot of TV is put together by teams, by writing staffs and several different directors. It's a great, very smart way to make television. It's worked for however long TV's been around."
Louis C. K.,,"I was a nerd growing up, and I'm a little antisocial and awkward."
Louis C. K.,,I don't have a room full of writers pitching ideas. It's just me out of my head.
Louis C. K.,,"A lot of the struggle I had with movies is I really loved moments and tones and feelings in a scene, and I loved creating those, but I never really had great stories to string them together."
Louis C. K.,,Talking is always positive. That's why I talk too much.
Louis C. K.,,"""I'm bored"" is a useless thing to say. You live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen none percent of."
Louis C. K.,"experience,work","I've learned from experience that if you work harder at it, and apply more energy and time to it, and more consistency, you get a better result. It comes from the work."
Louis C. K.,,Everything that people say is testable.
Louis C. K.,money,I never viewed money as being 'my money' I always saw it as 'the money.' It's a resource. If it pools up around me then it needs to be flushed back out into the system.
Louis C. K.,,"I think I'm past any window where I'm suddenly going to become surprisingly ripped so that people go, 'Oh, my God, what happened to you?'"
Louis C. K.,,I've met a lot of people who've lost their jobs and they still have a sense of humor.
Louis C. K.,,"I've tried to do away with lying in my life in the last few years, but it's hard."
Louis C. K.,,It's easier to cancel a show if it's expensive.
Louis C. K.,restaurants,It's kind of awkward to eat alone in a restaurant because everybody's looking at me.
Louis C. K.,"men,women","I don't think women are better than men, I think men are a lot worse than women."
Louis C. K.,,I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping as we all should. I dunno. You don't live that long. It doesn't matter.
Louis C. K.,twitter,"Twitter and Facebook and MySpace; all that stuff makes you warped. We've all basically given ourselves data entry jobs. I've actually heard people say things like, “Aw shit, I have to update my Twitter.” Really? You have to? That's a big priority for you?"
Louis C. K.,,"To me the goal of comedy is to just laugh, which is a really high hearted thing, visceral connection and reaction."
Louis C. K.,"immigration,language","I do have very deep, fond memories of my family in Mexico City, but I also remember feeling funny for not speaking English - I was basically an immigrant. But I picked up the language fast and soon I knew that I wanted to be a writer."
Louis C. K.,,"There are people that really live by doing the right thing, but I don't know what that is, I'm really curious about that. I'm really curious about what people think they're doing when they're doing something evil, casually. I think it's really interesting, that we benefit from suffering so much, and we excuse ourselves from it."
Louis C. K.,,I wish I could keep a journal. I have a lot of journals with one page half written in. I sometimes will write myself a quick email on my Blackberry when I think of something.
Louis C. K.,"husband,dating",Who wants to blow their husband? You want to blow a guy that you've been dating. And he's mysterious and you suck his cock and go home. Who wants to blow a guy and then go to IKEA with him all day?
Louis C. K.,,"I’m a vulgar, fucked-up degenerate comedian who did drugs. And I’m connecting with Christian mothers and fathers. I love that. That means so much to me."
Louis C. K.,driving,"You could drive a rental car until you don't want it. Just get out of it while it's moving and just walk away. No, I don't feel like being in that car any longer. Just call Hertz. Hi, your car is drifting into the intersection of 28th and Broadway, if you're interested. It's now your problem."
Louis C. K.,,"My ex-wife, she really didn't like the material that I did. And that's something I regret, that I wasn't more careful about making sure that she was O.K. with it. I just sort of didn't ask. So that's how that goes."
Louis C. K.,complaints,"Whenever single people complain about anything, I really want them to shut the fuck up. First of all, if you're single, your life has no consequence on the earth. Even if you're helping people aggressively, which you're fucking not, nobody gives a shit what happens to you. You can die, and it actually doesn't matter. It doesn't. Your mother will cry or whatever, but otherwise, nobody gives a shit."
Louis C. K.,"kids,food",What we’ve done with our modern food supply is absolute insanity. It’s not even real any more. You used to be able to give a kid an apple and they would love it. Kids can’t even taste apples any more. Apples taste like paper to kids now.
Louis C. K.,care,Cars and cameras are the two things I let myself be materialistic about. I don't care about other stuff.
Louis C. K.,,"My last name is Szekely. Sounds like Saykay. When I was a little kid I had an instructor in camp who called me Shnizneckely. He would make fun of my name and it hurt my feelings because I was a little pussy and I cried. He said, 'Well, how do you say it?' I said, Seekay. So he wrote 'C.K' on my jersey and everything. He made my name 'C.K' and I just stuck with it."
Louis C. K.,money,"My bank is the worst. They are screwing me. You know what they did to me? They're charging me money for not having enough money. Apparently, when you're broke, that costs money."
Louis C. K.,,"To me, comedies are usually the least funny movies. Movies that are actually a comedy are usually not all that funny. To me Goodfellas and Raging Bull are two of the funniest movies I ever saw."
Louis C. K.,,"Now we live in an amazing, amazing world and it's wasted on the crappiest generation of spoiled idiots."
Louis C. K.,,Everything that’s difficult you should be able to laugh about.
Louis C. K.,,A household name is like ketchup. Everybody wants ketchup. Ketchup doesn't hurt anybody.
Louis C. K.,boxing,I've always loved boxing. It's something I've always been extremely excited about.
Louis C. K.,soccer,I've had soccer moms come up and tell me they can relate when I say that I want to throw my baby in the trash.
Louis C. K.,,"Life isn't something you possess. It's something you take part in, and you witness."
Louis C. K.,,"I don't have a gun, but if I did, I would shoot a baby deer in the mouth and feel nothing."
Louis C. K.,,"Don't smoke pot. Don't bitch. Don't give up. Go on stage anywhere. Try, fail, repeat."
Louis C. K.,hitler,"Human kindness has no reward. You should give to others in every way you see. You should expect absolutely nothing from anyone. It should be your goal to love every human you encounter. All human suffering that you're aware of and continues without your effort to stop it becomes your crime. Humans are always evolving. If you do one thing that if done by every human would destroy the world, that makes you Hitler... I don't live by any of those. But I believe them all very strongly."
Louis C. K.,,I don't have a brother in real life.
Louis C. K.,"hate,arguments","I love being married, it's great, but I hate arguing. I hate fighting. You know what I do now? When we get in an argument, I just take her side against me. It's just easier; it goes quicker. She's like, 'What's wrong with you?' And I'm like, 'I know! Damn it! Argh!' She wins most of them anyway. I might as well be on the winning side occasionally."
Louis C. K.,importance,"When you first get married, you have a relationship that's so important to you, and you're working on it together. But then you have a kid. And you look at your kid and you go, ""Holy shit, this is my child. She has my DNA. She has my name. I would die for her."" And you look at your spouse and go, ""Who the fuck are you? You're a stranger."""
Louis C. K.,"white people,problems","We have white people problems in America. You know what that is? That’s when your life is amazing, so you just make stuff up to get worried about."
Louis C. K.,,"I am really tired of looking at my hips. I’m seriously really tired of standing naked in the mirror and staring at my hips for hours and hours while muttering, ""You hips. You hips need to get it together."""
Louis C. K.,alcohol,"I find that when people laugh really hard, it's usually because they're connecting and identifying in a way that they hadn't considered. That's my payoff. I'm not interested in other people thinking differently. I don't care. I'm not even educated; it's something that I'm not qualified to do. I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, ""I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives."""
Louis C. K.,,"The Greatest Generation gets too much credit. Those World War II guys, if they had all the shit we have today, they'd be assholes too. It's just circumstantial. It's what you're called on to do that makes you great. We haven't been called on to do anything but buy shit and get fat."
Louis C. K.,,"Everything's amazing right now, and nobody's happy."
Louis C. K.,stuff,"Most Americans have so much crap, that you could lose most of it and still have way more stuff than the average Canadian."
Louis C. K.,,"Shut up... let me tell you, let me. Every time I look at your face or even remember it, it wrecks me. And the way you are with me and you’re just fun and you shit all over me and you make fun of me and you're real. I don't have enough time in any day to think about you enough... I don't even think about women anymore. I think about you."
Louis C. K.,,"There’s nowhere I won’t go. As long as it’s horribly, horribly true and or wrong."
Louis C. K.,,"Whenever I've encountered a Christian saying, 'Why don't you stop talking like that so I can hear you?' I think, 'Well you're the one putting the earmuffs on, but I wish you could hear me because I like you.'"
Louis C. K.,art,"To me, art supplies are always okay to buy."
Louis C. K.,white people,"People are too afraid of uptown. A lot of people will tell you, like, 'Don't go to Harlem. You can never go there 'cause as soon as you get there, they kill you.' That's what people think. As soon as you arrive in Harlem, someone just stabs you in the face right away... That's people's image of Harlem: just everyone standing around waiting for lost white people to kill all day."
Louis C. K.,,"We spend all our time now on customer service phone calls. I used to read when I was on the toilet, but now that's when I make customer service calls."
Louis C. K.,,I had five dollars in the bank that I couldn't have for three days until they charged me another 15. Leaving me with -10. What does that mean? I don't even have no money any more. I wish I had nothing. But I don't have it. I don't have that much. I have not ten. Negative ten. I can't afford to buy something that doesn't cost anything. I can only afford to get something that costs you give me ten dollars.
Louis C. K.,douchebags,"The other kid we have she's a girl and she's four. And she's also a fuckin' asshole. It's true man, I'm serious. I say that with no remorse. Fucking asshole, she's a douchebag. She is! Fucking jerk."
Louis C. K.,audience,"I'm close to my audience. I think I have more tools in my box than other guys who might try it. Also, I know how to do this stuff. I know how to write and shoot and edit. I'm technically adept and that helped with the website. You need a big skill set."
Louis C. K.,,"When you're young as a comic, you don't have a lot of leverage."
Louis C. K.,,"Credibility lasts about two cycles of bad material, and then you'll probably never get it back. If you let people down, that's really hard to come back from - harder than climbing from nothing to something, even."
Louis C. K.,,"It's hard to really look at somebody and go: ""Hey, maybe something nice will happen."" You just don't - I know too much about life to have any optimism, because I know even if it's nice, it's going to lead to shit. I know that if you smile at somebody and they smile back, you've just decided that something shitty is going to happen."
Louis C. K.,,They charged me 15 dollars. That's how much it costs to only have 20 dollars.
Louis C. K.,complaints,"I remember the day I saw my hair was thinning. I don't remember caring much. I don't care. It's just hair. It never bothered me much. I was pretty young, too. And it happened and is happening very slowly. I have a feeling dead people get really mad when we complain about losing hair."
Louis C. K.,,"I just always loved comedy and I really wanted to be good at it. And it was heartbreaking, 'cause I started and I wasn't good at it. I was only 17-years-old, so I had a lot to learn about life in general. But I just kept on trying. I was young enough and stupid enough and I had no other choice. I had nothing else I was good at."
Louis C. K.,,"There’s a need to perfect things in a writers’ room, and that can take a lot of fun out of a show sometimes. It’s a struggle. It depends on your personality. Some people love working with a writing staff. I had a great writing staff on Lucky Louie, but it sometimes felt like Congress or something."
Louis C. K.,homeless,You know what hilarious means? Hilarious means so funny that you almost went insane when you heard that shi... its so funny that is almost ruined your life. You're homeless now because you can't cope or reason anymore. Because that hilarious thing just shattered your mind and three months later you got shit and leaves in your hair and you're drenched in pee in the gutter. That's how funny hilarious is.
Louis C. K.,,"When you write from your gut and let the stuff stay flawed and don't let anybody tell you to make it better, it can end up looking like nothing else."
Louis C. K.,,"There’s a huge amount of work that goes into placating a network in regular television. It’s literally 70% or 80% of your workload, is showing them the material, getting their notes and presenting it to them and making sure they weigh in. It’s a huge amount of work."
Martin Lawrence,,"If you don't believe in yourself, then who will believe in you? The next man's way of getting there might not necessarily work for me, so I have to create my own ways of getting there."
Martin Lawrence,,"I know you think I'm crazy. I go into a different room and I actually felt like it takes me to a better place, positive instead of negative."
Martin Lawrence,,I didn't know the full facts of life until I was 17. My father never talked about his work.
Martin Lawrence,family,We grew to know the meaning of love. That is what allowed me and my family to stay close together.
Martin Lawrence,success,"For me, this was all or nothing. I left no room for anything else. That goal was just for my own push, my own self-esteem. The fear of not being a success in my life made me push even harder."
Martin Lawrence,judgment,"I don't really judge. To each his own. You like what you like. If you want someone who's big-boned and you like that, ain't nothing wrong with having a little extra meat on there. If you like them thin-boned, then thats okay too."
Martin Lawrence,,"It's always fun to be able to have a voice, because it helps me to stay in tune with the project and the people that I am working with. Ther's nothing worse than being on a project and not being able to have a voice. I don't like that."
Martin Lawrence,,"My career and life are over, and I have nothing to live for."
Martin Lawrence,,"Here goes all these rumors writin' about me. I see on the paper, one of'em says ""Martin tries to jump out of a plane using his jacket as a parachute."" Now ain't that some bullshit! As I'm trying to get my life together, they're gonna write that bullshit. I know damn well you can't jump out no plane using your jacket as a parachute. Shit, I know you got to use your pants."
Martin Lawrence,"television,challenges","Nobody's ever challenged me and tapped into what I can do. I ain't played a villain which I believe I can do and do real well. There hasn't been any director who has been able to challenge me to go there. At this point in my life I've done a lot of things from stand-up to my own television show for five years to successful comedy shows, and concert films."
Martin Lawrence,,I wanted to trust in my partners and the directors and producers and do the best I can to deliver what I could deliver.
Martin Lawrence,,No one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life.
Martin Lawrence,"respect,family","You can be cool and at the same time respect your woman, who will hopefully become your wife, who will hopefully become the mother of your kids. America needs to get back to family values."
Martin Lawrence,,"Sorry, I had told Craig and them I'm gon' kick it with them. Gotta go! See you when I see you!"
Martin Lawrence,,If somebody pisses me off and I understand it ain't personal then I'll go to another place and I'll meditate.
Martin Lawrence,"kids,worth","Fatherhood means a great deal to me. I love it. To me, there aint nothing better, because your kids keep it real with you. When you think things are bad, you look at them and they show you how things could be all right, and it's all worth it."
Martin Lawrence,,"Enjoy your popcorn and enjoy the jokes. It's just a movie, so have fun!"
Martin Lawrence,,"It's botherin' me, man. You know, ""you can't say this, you can't say that,"" I'm like, well, how am I gonna talk about the world? You know? I mean I need to talk about something to you all, can I - can I do it? Can I talk to y'all? I mean, I hope the kids are in bed, you know, because I got to talk, y'all. "
Martin Lawrence,parents,"White parents use time out. My mom used a different type of time out. She'd be like, 'There... take time out to pick up your teeth.'"
Martin Lawrence,,"I don't live to eat, I eat to live."
Martin Lawrence,,Somebody put something in his mouth. My zipper's stuck.
Martin Lawrence,,Here’s a synonym for procreation... fuck you.
Martin Lawrence,,"Go head on, with yo' fat apple pie ass, Aunt Bea!"
Martin Lawrence,differences,"You make due with the time you have here. Hopefully when you pass on, somebody can look back and say, 'Wow, they made a difference in some kind of way.'"
Martin Lawrence,jail,"There better not be a black person in here that says they don't know nobody in jail... 'cause that's bullshit. Ray-Ray, Earl, Craig, Shorty Tim, Lil' Reg, all them motherfuckers in jail... Shonda's little brother... all of 'em, in jail... chillin'."
Martin Lawrence,boxing,"Boxing kept me out of the streets, by giving me something to do. And it gave me a father figure in the coach that was there for me. I just reiterated what my mother was trying to teach me about focusing and getting my life together."
Martin Lawrence,soul,"I don't want to sound facetious, but humour is the key to the soul. You know what I mean?"
Martin Lawrence,,You used to be looking good from afar. Now you just far from looking good!
Martin Lawrence,,"On the Wizard of Oz Lion's lookin' for some courage... Tin Man's lookin' for a heart... ain't none of them lookin' for some pussy, and they skippin' down the street with a bitch!"
Martin Lawrence,"inspiration,knowledge","God inspired me, because I was blessed with the knowledge that I wanted to do this. And my mother supported it. She said, 'Whatever it is you want to do. If you believe acting or comedy is what you really want to do, I can only tell you it's not easy, it's very hard, but I'll support you.' Her supporting me enabled me to move forward."
Martin Lawrence,,"I'm most proud of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me, in my life. He's given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down, but you can still get back up. Hopefully I'll learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing I do."
Milton Berle,,"If evolution really works, how come mothers only have two hands?"

Milton Berle,doctors,My doctor recently told me that jogging could add years to my life. I think he was right. I feel ten years older already.

What's your symptoms, Uncle Bert?' 'Well, my bowel, I got blood pouring out of it all the time? and I got searing, clawing pains?ripping, tearing, mind-screeching bowel pains?and they're combined with aching, dull, soul-deadening bowel pain. Those are basically my symptoms; how 'bout you?' 'I get happy. I tend to be able to talk to people easier, I find. Sometimes, I'll meet a lady at a bar, got the same disease I do, and I'll fuck her.'"
Norm Macdonald,"sex,brain","This is the amount of time you think about sex: every once in a while. The problem becomes, when you think about it, it's all you can think about. It encompasses your whole brain. You're like a fucking werewolf or something. Usually you're a civilized human being, but then every couple of days, you?re like 'arrrgh.' Then you've got to close the blinds."
Norm Macdonald,dreams,"You ever be having a really good dream, and then, uh- right in the middle of the dream you wake up, right in the best part of the dream? And there you are, back in your stinkin' life again? Man, that's rough, eh?"
Norm Macdonald,sex,"This is a thing I read by a scientist... it said scientists now say that a man thinks about sex once every 7.3 seconds. Now, I know what I think every 7.3 seconds. It's just a bunch of meaningless gibberish."
Pat Cooper,,"We need to try to work out something so folks can be there. We're going to try to find some solution so we don't have to keep repeating ourselves during the regular meeting. I think it is a board issue, but we're just going to try to make some suggestions. We would be open to doing the meetings at a different time."
Pat Cooper,,"When I was a boy, we had forty five statues of saints in my house. Ever have ninety eyes looking at you every time you have to go to the bathroom?"
Pat Cooper,,The new breed of comics are completely different than what I did.
Pat Cooper,,"One time I visited my mother and found St. Anthony's statue upside down. I say, 'Mama, why's St. Anthony upside down?' 'He don't answer my novena, he stays that way!'"
Pat Cooper,sisters,"One of my sisters wanted to be an opera singer. So, we spent a few dollars to try to train her, because Italian people would like to have an opera singer in the family. But she's got trouble coughing, let alone singing. One day, she was in the shower singing 'Madame Butterfly,' three days later the Japs attacked Pearl Harbor."
Pat Cooper,"cars,arguments","When I got older I said, ""Pa, I want an automobile."" He said, ""What do you want an automobile for, when you have the subway. Five cents - the open the door for you, you sit down. Then when you get to the station they open the door and you get out. In a $700 auto who's going to open the door for you?"" You couldn't argue - they were never stuck for an answer."
Pat Cooper,truth,"I say, when you tell the truth, you never offend nobody, particularly if you do it with dignity."
Pat Cooper,,"I remember on Thanksgiving all the kids wanted the drumstick. There were four of us then. Well, today you can go into the supermarket and get 12 drumsticks. Years ago you couldn't do that. So I was sucking on the neck for two years. My mother told me it was the leg, and I believed it. I went to my father and said, ""Why is my leg always cockeyed?"" He said, ""The bird has arthritis."""
Pat Cooper,"embarrassment,flowers","When my mother would make me sandwiches for school - zucchini and eggs, pepper and eggs, everything was with eggs - the oil would drip out of the bag. She didn't care if I lost the sandwich - she wanted that brown bag back. She used to give me artichoke sandwiches. You have no idea how embarrassing it is to sit in the schoolyard eating an artichoke with a piece of bread. A lot of kids didn't know what it was, they'd say, ""Look at that guy eating flowers!"""
Pat Cooper,,"We said to them to take all of the students who are troubled students and work with them. They're not bad. They're troubled because they don't have what you had and what I had growing up. It was tough, and it's still tough, but Jodi and her staff are making it work. These are the kids that would have been out on the street robbing and stealing. "
Pat Cooper,"nowdays,christmas","Today when kids receive their confirmations you have to give them a contract that you're going to buy them a car. I wanted a bicycle, and as I got a little order I was told Santa Claus might bring me a bicycle. Then one year my father borrowed a bicycle at Christmas, put it under the tree and I rode it all that day. The next day it wasn't there. ""Where's my bicycle?"" My father said, ""Somebody stole it."" Then I'd see an other kid on the street, and he'd have a bike. What I didn't know was that all the fathers were doing the same thing - the were all using one bicycle."
Pat Cooper,abortion,"My grandmother, on the stage, has an abortion! Gives birth to a three-pound Shetland pony! My grandfather is the jockey, comes in third and paid $2.80!"
Pat Cooper,business,I was the worst bricklayer in the world. I can show you buildings I worked on - they're a hazard. I closed a window one time. I forgot to set back a brick and I just kept going - there I was singing 'There's no business like show business'.
Pat Cooper,,"My uncle was the first one in my family to get a telephone. It was like going to the moon. He came running over to tell us, and we were so proud. A telephone! We didn't have to go to the candy store to phone any more. We went around telling everyone. But we didn't hear from my uncle for three days, so my father got worried. He said, ""Let's go over there."" We got there, and my uncle was very depressed. I asked, ""What's the matter?"" He said, ""I got a telephone and nobody called me."" He didn't give his number out - he didn't know that you had to!"
Pat Cooper,vacation,"I used to ask my father, ""Can we go on vacation?"" He'd say, ""Yeah, on the fire escape."" One day I was out there when it was raining, and I banged on the fire escape. He said, ""I can't hear you, you're on vacation."" Then he'd ask, ""Do you really want to go on vacation? O. K. The Whole family will go, pack your bag."" In those days they had little cowboy bags. I put my shirt in and - we went into the yard. The yard! He said, ""Isn't it wonderful that you are here, in India?"" I looked at my father like he was cracking up. He said, ""It was a wonderful trip on that boat."" I said, ""This isn't India."" He said, ""If I say you're in India, you're in India."""
Pat Cooper,,I knew I loved it because I could take the failures. I was like a professional fighter - they're beat 20 times in a row and they just want that one win.
Paul Reiser,,I'd distract myself until finally it was a combination of things. The show was over and I had time on my hands. I had taken time and played and just relaxed.
Paul Reiser,,"A new child in the house is a huge tourist attraction. It's like Disneyland, except there the lines are longer and no one brings casseroles."
Paul Reiser,,"The best part of being married is... you don't have to explain a lot of things. Those wordless moments when you both know that what you witnessed together is funny, idiotic, or really sweet. Being connected is pretty miraculous."
Paul Reiser,,"There's something that happens in that delivery room, when a woman becomes ten times more a woman, and a guy becomes six times less a man. You feel really dopey and useless and like a spectator. I did, anyway."
Paul Reiser,diapers,"The first time I tried to put a new diaper on my baby, I yanked the little Velcro strap too jerkily and actually punched the little guy in the jaw. A real solid shot, too. I knew instinctively that this could not be correct. Unless you're specifically trying to raise a welterweight, continual deliverance of powerful uppercuts is not advised when handling newborns."
Paul Reiser,,This is not the most right I've ever been.
Paul Reiser,,"The simple combination of letters and sounds you select as a name for your baby can result in a life of carefree coolness or decades of expensive therapy. ""Hi, I'm Jake"" versus ""Hi, I'm... Tapioca"""
Paul Reiser,,"The most challenging part of being a dad is trying to postpone the moment when they realize you don't know anything. I love any sentence that begins with ""Daddy...?"" because it's implied they're looking up to you - that you'll have the answer. The truth is, I don't have any answers. "
Paul Reiser,,"We had the boy's name picked out, but we didn't have a girl's. When he turned out to be a boy, we were so relieved. Literally, in the middle of contracting and pushing, and with my wife being drugged - out and half - lucid, we were still coming up with names."
Paul Reiser,,"The most rewarding part about being a dad is just looking at children who didn't exist at some point. The first time you saw them, they were the size of a quarter, in a sonogram, and now they can pour orange juice and yell at each other."
Paul Reiser,,"My wife and I never agree on the dishtowels. It's a matter of terms. She asks me not to put the dishtowel in the sink. So I drape it over the sink, but not in the sink. If that's our biggest problem, I think we're in good shape."
Paul Reiser,,"When you realize you would consider not having a child just so you could take an occasional snooze and be available to see Batman Retires the same weekend it comes out, you have to take a good hard look at yourself and acknowledge, ""I am a shallow, shallow person."""
Paul Reiser,,"We have such a long, familiar history with Peter Falk. The minute his mug is on that screen people smile."
Paul Reiser,,"We made this movie for $17, and nobody got anything. So it never dawned on me that we would get real people."
Paul Reiser,,The most used appliance in our house is my 10-year-old son Leon's Xbox.
Paul Reiser,,He was born early. But he was born within a safe range of premature.
Paul Reiser,,"Having a baby dragged me, kicking and screaming, from the world of self-absorption."
Paul Reiser,,The biggest thing I remember is that there was just no transition. You hit the ground diapering.
Paul Reiser,dreams,"Field of Dreams is the only movie - and I saw it in the theater - on an afternoon when I was on location somewhere, and there were like 12 people in the theater. I was just so devastated; I couldn't get out of my seat. And I sat and watched it a second time."
Paul Reiser,,"My wife would say my worst habit is that I'm not good at dropping subjects. If something bothers me, I'll bring it up endlessly and relentlessly. I think it's a search for clarity, but she uses different words."
Paul Reiser,,"In fact, I had the idea because of Peter Falk. I saw my dad watching a Peter Falk movie and something clicked in my head. I gotta go make a movie for Peter Falk and me."
Paul Reiser,,In the original draft I was 27 and Peter was 55 in the script. That's not the same as a guy in his 40s and a dad in the end of his 70s. It's a different point in both our lives.
Paul Reiser,,"And after you've done the acting, there's a lot of places you can put your input - in the editing, in the production of it, in the rewriting of it and so on."
Paul Reiser,,"And in that time, I lost my dad and had kids of my own. It was like, OK, I get it now. I know what fatherhood is all about. And you look at your parents differently."
Paul Reiser,,"The way I figure, there are two types of people: those who get it and those who don't. If they get it, there's nothing to explain, and if they don't, there's no point in trying to explain. They don't get it. Move on."
Paul Reiser,,"But at the same time that the experience is pulling you apart, it's also bonding you. You have this joint venture! You both made this baby. And that's the thing I still can't get over."
Paul Reiser,,Every time I see Peter Falk in the movie I think that would be great. We'd be fun together.
Paul Reiser,,"But you get past that and realize you have to let go of what you think you want. There'll be plenty of time for that later. Right now, go and be with that baby. Just play with this beautiful little boy."
Paul Reiser,,New parents always sound like hucksters in a pyramid scheme. Anyone who has kids and then gets you to go and have kids gets a check from Huckster Headquarters.
Paul Reiser,,It's not like some movies where you're following a bunch of different stories you can cut around. There was nowhere to cut to. It's these guys. We're not cutting back to anybody else.
Paul Reiser,,Nothing would make me happier if Peter Falk would finally win his Oscar for this. Not just as the writer but as a fan and a friend. It would be so great.
Paul Reiser,"coffee,tea","I love coffee. I don’t drink coffee but I love it. I drink tea and I don’t like it. Let me say something about tea. Tea starts out bad and never gets better. You put in honey, cream, sugar, lemon and you still go ""Ooh that’s bad!"" And the people who make tea know it’s bad. That’s why they give you so many choices. You go into a store and there’s a thousand types of teas. Every herb fruit and spice in every combination. They’re desperate to make this stuff palatable and it almost works. You think, ""Wow! Look at this! Apple, cinnamon, mango cherry tea. This should be great. I like all those things... This is going to be just great."" You take a sip and go ""Nope That’s still very bad."""
Paul Reiser,,"But I really felt that, something about the lights going down, and the sense of community. I saw this movie at one festival, and there were 1700 people."
Paul Reiser,,I'd never directed before and this movie's too important to me to put in the hands of some guy who has never directed. Even if it's me.
Paul Reiser,,"I've come to realize that making it your life's work to be different than your parents is not only hard to do, it's a dumb idea. Not everything we found fault with was necessarily wrong; we were right, for example, to resent, as kids, being told when to go to bed. We'd be equally wrong, as parents, to let our kids stay up all night. To throw out all the tools of parenting just because our parents used them would be like making yourself speak English without using ten letters of the alphabet; it's hard to do."
Paul Reiser,,"We all hold on to some image of the family we want, based one way or another on the family we had. Lots of people are thrilled about the families they came from, others couldn't get away fast enough. Most people fall into that vast middle ground: great affection mixed with a few ideas for improvement. A couple of things they wish could have perhaps been done differently."
Paul Reiser,,They don't see that whole pattern. Worm/death. Worm/death. I would catch on. 
Paul Reiser,,"You know, the fact that every morning you get a script in your mailbox, that's going to stop. All these little pedestrian, mundane things. And the cash."
Paul Reiser,,"I'm feeling very vindicated that, when I see the audiences laughing and being moved, we were right."
Paul Reiser,,"Peanut butter and lamb chops were not foods that had ever been a significant part of our life before pregnancy. In fact, my wife almost never ate either.So where did these craving come from? I concluded it's the baby, ordering in."
Paul Reiser,,"The jewel in the baby product crown is the stroller. And if in America you are what you drive, then in Parentland, you are what you push."
Paul Reiser,,"Parents often give middle names just so that later, when they're yelling at the kid, they can drag it out. ""Henry David Thoreau, you come in here this instant!"""
Paul Reiser,,"The consumer mentality - we like something, what other flavor does it come in? We like that TV show, does it come in a book form? Does it come in a capsule? How about a soup?"
Paul Reiser,sisters,"I was just following the corporate manifest, but at the premiere my sister punched me in the stomach. I thought, 'This doesn't bode well for the public.'"
Paul Reiser,,Marriage is just an elaborate game that allows two selfish people to periodically feel that they're not.
Paul Reiser,,I used to walk into a party and scan the room for attractive women. Now I look for women to hold my baby so I can eat potato salad sitting down.
Paul Reiser,,"It felt very natural right off the bat. It was really tailor-made for him and mine was tailor-made for me, so it was easy to jump into."
Paul Reiser,,"I was visiting my parents, and I walked into a room where my father was watching a Peter Falk movie on TV... I think it was 'The Cheap Detective.' Anyway, my father was belly-laughing, and he never really did that. I thought, 'If Peter Falk can make my dad laugh, then I'm going to come up with a movie in which Peter Falk plays my father.'"
Paul Reiser,,"By shrewdly linking procreation to an act likely to make you stupid with excitement, God has seen to it that Life does indeed go on. It's possible, by the way, that this is why God's name comes up so often in the middle of the act; it's a salute to the author: ""Hey, whoever made this up - thanks."""
Paul Reiser,,"There was a period where our child's birth was getting really close, and we still had nothing. We were dangerously close to calling him Untitled Baby Project."
Paul Reiser,new york,"Any issues my parents went through are very prominent in the movie, even though they enjoyed a happy relationship. The story actually started for me when my mom told me a few years ago that because she got a job, she never made it to the World's Fair in New York, and that's a missed opportunity that always stayed with her."
Paul Reiser,,"It is not important to know what facts are true. The relationships portrayed are real. My mother did have a job interview with my father. She worked alongside him for awhile, they dated, were married and had a family. She never did get to the World's Fair."
Paul Reiser,,"A friend told me to listen to my heart. Another friend told me to listen to my gut. Maybe I need an autopsy, because right now my colon is kind of iffy."
Paul Reiser,parents,As you get older you realize your parents don't look so dumb - and that you're not as smart as you thought you were.
Paul Reiser,,"Middle names are kind of like vice presidents: It's a fine distinction and certainly an honor, but you're never not aware that someone else got the real job."
Paul Reiser,,"People come up to us and ask how we knew so much about their own family... I'm talking about people from faraway places, too. I get people from Turkey and Chile coming up to me and saying I wrote about their family."
Paul Reiser,inspiration,Once in a while you get a moment of clarity - an inspiration - and they don't come that frequently.
Paul Reiser,,"So we’re on this plane, and across the aisle from us was another couple, about our age, traveling with their two children - a two-year-old girl and a very new boy who, though tiny in stature, had a crying scream so piercing, it was annoying people on other planes."
Paul Reiser,,"If a tree falls on your head in a forest and no one hears it, it still hurts."
Paul Reiser,,You don't have to have 14 committees and studios weighing in. Its really just you.
Paul Reiser,,There's something very refreshing about being on stage.
Paul Reiser,,I'm not smart enough to write about something that didn't actually happen to me. But I couldn't write a space movie if you put a gun to my head.
Paul Reiser,,"I remember my wife and I used to get on plane and see everybody else with their babies. They'd be putting strollers and car seats up above, and we'd think: Oh, please Lord, don't make us go through that."
Paul Reiser,,"Not only do I sing to him, I sing entire conversations. You become Jerry Lewis."
Paul Reiser,,She kind of reminds one of Helen. There's something very similar about Elizabeth Perkins.
Paul Reiser,dogs,Get a good dog. We have not picked up food in the kitchen in 15 years.
Paul Reiser,new york,Upstate New York in the middle of October. You can't get more beautiful than that.
Paul Reiser,,"I always loved comedy, but I never knew it was something you could learn to do. I always thought that some people are born comedians, just like some people are born dentists."
Paul Reiser,,"But the two of them together, broke my heart. Olympia and Peter, those scenes... When they're kissing in their 20s and then kissing in their 70s, that's what it is. And they had never met five minutes before they shot those scenes."
Paul Reiser,,"It felt like such a right idea that it didn't bother me to put it away, because I knew it would be ready when it's ready. When I had kids, I realized I understood my parents better. I had more compassion for them and I look at my kids and realize, 'Oh, man. This is just the same cycle all over again.'"
Paul Reiser,market,"If the powers that be see there is a bigger market out there, it will make it easier for the next time around."
Paul Reiser,babies,"Babies awaken slightly disoriented, with a look that's half Angel and half Lost Tourist."
Paul Reiser,,"When people talk about wanting to ""have children someday,"" what they really mean is that they want babies. Nobody wants an angry adolescent. Nobody wants an obnoxious seven-year-old trying to wear out dirty words they just learned in school that day. What they really want is cute, adorable babies who love you and need you. The bad stuff is just the price you agree to pay for having the good stuff."
Paul Reiser,babies,"They're not the sharpest people - babies. So, you must be everything to them."
Paul Reiser,,"Younger kids, they understand that things aren't so perfect with their father or with their mother."
Paul Reiser,,"When my son said, ""I can't stop thinking about girls,"" I said, ""That's not gonna stop. Congratulations. You're in the club. From now until the day you die, one way or another you'll be thinking about girls."""
Paul Reiser,,"Over the years, there certainly have been plenty of ideas that I've had and given up on, but for this one, the only thing that was standing in its way was me doing it - I just had to write it... And then if it didn't happen, it didn't happen. But I didn't want it to be for lack of effort on my part, so I had hunch that it would be a good story and that we would work well together. And it certainly worked out that way."
Paul Reiser,,"Three has always been tougher than Two. Think of any of your famous threesomes. The Three Stooges? Look at the anger there. My bet is that before Curly was born, Moe and Larry could play together for hours without even a single poke in the eye. Huey, Dewey, and Louie? Donald Duck never had a moment's peace. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly? I rest my case."
Paul Reiser,,Our date-nightrule is no talking about the kids. That lasts about to the end of the driveway. 
Paul Reiser,,"From the minute we're born, boys and girls stare at each other, trying to figure out if they like what they see. Like parade lines, passing each other for mutual inspection. You march, you look. You march, you look. If you're interested, you stop and talk, and if it doesn't work out, you just get back in the parade. You keep marching, and you keep looking."
Paul Reiser,,"My parenting style could be described as not ""good cop"" or ""bad cop"" so much as ""nervous cop."" I'm always yelling for somebody to stop because they're about to get hurt. I'm the ""take a jacket,"" ""slow down"" guy."
Paul Rodriguez,,Those are adult magazines. Anybody can own them. It doesn't prove the charge.
Paul Rodriguez,,Sometimes I think war is God's way of teaching us geography.
Paul Rodriguez,,"Everybody really needs to laugh... If you don't laugh, you're not going to live long."
Paul Rodriguez,,Maybe he's my good luck charm.
Paul Rodriguez,,"What’s wrong about eating cows? What do you think god made them for? Their big, their stupid, their delicious. You want more reasons? I never met an animal more prepared to die than a cow. Next time you go to the farm look at a cow in the eyes, it is begging you for a bullet."
Paul Rodriguez,sport,"Hunting is not a sport. In a sport, both sides should know they're in the game."
Paul Rodriguez,dreams,"It's like a dream coming true. So when you actually accomplish it, you almost don't know how to react. You imagined you'd run up and down the street screaming, but you're just stunned instead. Like, 'Is this real?'"
Paul Rodriguez,"hollywood,business",It is my belief that Latinos in show business have to be self sufficient and creative while aggressively attempting to penetrate post-mogul Hollywood. Self- starting is becoming the path to serious studio support.
Paul Rodriguez,,"Latinos are black, white, brown, beige. What does that say about our ancestors? We'll sleep with anybody!"
Paul Rodriguez,animals,"Animals don't have anyone to protect them. If we don't stand up, the people who are harming animals will never get stopped."
Paul Rodriguez,life,"Life isn’t like a box of chocolates. It’s more like a jar of jalapenos. What you do today, might burn your butt tomorrow."
Paula Poundstone,,How do you come back? It's one step at a time. I'm optimistic because I don't know what else to be.
Paula Poundstone,,"I have jokes I've told before and will tell again, but my favorite part of the night is talking to the crowd."
Paula Poundstone,,I'm thankful that my memory is good because my vision is going.
Paula Poundstone,,I'll probably never have children because I don't believe in touching people for any reason.
Paula Poundstone,,"There are those wonderful moments of clarity in life when one is reminded how irreparably flawed we humans are. Once, when I was nineteen, on the subway in Boston I lost my balance slightly and bumped into an elderly woman. I quickly apologized and she replied, ""Well, hold on to something, stupid."" There it is. That's it. That's it in a nutshell. I don't want to sound negative, but I think every fetus should be shown a film of that incident, maybe projected up on the uterine wall, and then asked if it wants to come out. I am a strong believer in a woman's right to choose, but I also think that in the last trimester, the kid should be given every opportunity to back out."
Paula Poundstone,,"They're not going to teach science at all. What they do is take the science students down to the lake, tie them in burlap sacks, and throw them in. If God thinks they're good science students, they float."
Paula Poundstone,,"My act is sort of improvisational. I have a skeleton in my head, but no fat or skin on it."
Paula Poundstone,,"There is no course of life so weak and sottish as that which is managed by order, method, and discipline."
Paula Poundstone,,There are really only so many foods and so many ways you can prepare them.
Paula Poundstone,,"When I sat down to write I just felt like a geek writing about myself. And then it dawned on me, just because of the way I am, I can't stop talking, and part of the problem is that anything that gets said reminds me of something that happened to me one time, and invariably I cut people off and talk about myself."
Paula Poundstone,,"I was the youngest in my family. When the other kids went to school, my mother would make them breakfast and then she would go back to bed for an hour, so I was sort of babysat by television."
Paula Poundstone,,"Inside there are three pouches of two. This is what happens to me: I open the first pouch, and I eat one tart, and I enjoy it very much, as naturally I would. And then I feel, Well, I have to eat the second one or it will go stale. Well, now I’ve eaten two, and it’s no longer just a snack, it’s a meal. I figure I may as well eat two more. And then finally I’m just like, Well hell, I don’t just want two pop tarts hangin’ out in a box. I eat the last two just to tidy up, really."
Paula Poundstone,,"I checked in to a hotel the other day and the woman behind the corner said to me, “Do you have a floor preference?” I go, “Yeah, I would like a floor.” Apparently, they can just suspend you from the ceiling now."
Paula Poundstone,,"I only do two things in my life, and that's take care of my kids and work. Fortunately, these are my favorite things to do, so it works out."
Paula Poundstone,,I'm the only person I know of who's ever been pulled over for attempted speeding.
Paula Poundstone,,"The pleasure of the mulch pile is incomprehensible. I wouldn't care if they just hauled the mulch to the landfill somewhere. Obviously, grass clippings are biodegradable, but when they're bunched together at the landfill, they become badly influenced by other garbage."
Paula Poundstone,,"If only someone would do for cows what Bambi did for deer. Cows have been in films, but they haven't starred. I'm still willing to eat a species that is only a supporting player."
Paula Poundstone,,"I've always thought that if my death was imminent, I would read. When I can't focus on a book, I tend to keep reading the same page. My guess is, I would've read, like the first page of Nicholas Nickleby over and over again."
Paula Poundstone,,"I used to use Shopping for a Better World by the Council on Economic Priorities for my responsible consumer needs. It rates companies with an A, C, or F on their environmental impact, their record on hiring women and minorities, and their willingness to disclose that information to the public. So, for example, there's Chevron with an F in the environment category but a B under minorities and an A under the disclosure heading. It seems to me that if a company is destroying the earth, the fact that they're including minorities in their pillaging and are willing to tell us they're doing it should be little comfort. It's like forgiving an ax murderer who is nice to children."
Paula Poundstone,,"I have short-term memory loss, though I like to think of it as Presidential eligibility."
Paula Poundstone,,"The mistakes that I made I made because I drank too much. I don't think that's going to happen any more. Am I going to make mistakes as a parent? Sadly, every day. I'm looking around for the perfect parent and I haven't seen one yet."
Paula Poundstone,,"I mean, I do love clever and witty, but I think that the 'Three Stooges' were geniuses. They'd have to be for their appeal to have lasted this long."
Paula Poundstone,change,"I'm really more prolific than most stand-ups. My act changes. I do fold in new experiences, new observations, whatever you want to call it."
Paula Poundstone,,"I have a horrible memory and I used to consider that a liability, but I've learned along the way that talking to people is really a beautiful thing."
Paula Poundstone,,I get the first flight out from anywhere I am because I have to come home to my kids.
Paula Poundstone,holidays,"I don't need a holiday or a feast to feel grateful for my children, the sun, the moon, the roof over my head, music, and laughter, but I like to take this time to take the path of thanks less traveled."
Paula Poundstone,,"I did auditions at a club called the Comedy Connection. They wanted nothing to do with me. But one night they were doing a night of all women comics, and they invited me to do that."
Paula Poundstone,,"I also like a great Caesar salad with anchovies, although I don't know why some places say 'with anchovies.' If you're making a proper Caesar salad, it's going to have anchovies."
Paula Poundstone,,I don't have a bank account because I don't know my mother's maiden name and apparently that's the key to the whole thing right there. I go in every few weeks and guess.

And then I feel, “Well, I have to eat the second one or it will go stale.” Well, now I’ve eaten two, and it’s no longer just a snack, it’s a meal. I figure I may as well eat two more. And then finally I’m just like, “Well hell, I don’t just want two pop tarts hangin’ out in a box.” I eat the last two just to tidy up, really."
Paula Poundstone,,We need a twelve-step group for compulsive talkers; they could call it Anon Anon.
Paula Poundstone,,"It's funny that we think of libraries as quiet demure places where we are shushed by dusty, bun-balancing, bespectacled women.

Paula Poundstone,,"Hell yeah, I still wear zoot suits on stage!!! I don’t care that they went out of style in the 30s and that I went out of style in the 80s. Look at it like this: You know how Gallagher smashes watermelons and Larry the Cable Guy says ‘Get Er Done’ and Bill Hicks deconstructs society and enlightens people with the truth in a deeply hilarious way? Well, I wear horrendous looking outfits on stage. That’s my thing. And, dare I say, it’s worked out pretty damn well for me. Everybody in the world used to know who I was twenty five years ago.

Not many. Tucker Carlson, maybe…"

Paula Poundstone,,"I was one of the first people to almost actually vomit over hearing the use of the phrase ""family values"" and I pride myself on never having fallen for the idea that Barbara Bush was sweet and grandmotherly. I met Barbara Bush and, as I expected, she was a tank with eyes, not a nice person at all and why should that blow anybody away?"

Ray Romano,"pope,museums",I had a very Italian house - the “plastic furniture you couldn’t sit on” house. Did anybody have the museum house? For a kid it’s traumatic. Towels you can never touch.

Ray Romano,golf,"I'm now unemployed. It's a weird feeling with no work, but at least there's still golf. Standup comedy is like my core, it's what I do. But I want to be a pro golfer. It's a love/hate relationship with golf. I can come away feeling so serene, and yet, it's the thing that I can let get to me to throw a club and say curses that don't even exist. I'm obsessed with something that won't let me master it. I don't know. I need therapy."

Tim Allen,,"In the last three years of racing I've met as many women fans as men fans, and in NASCAR it's the same thing.

Wanda Sykes,divorce,"When you get married, you stand there and you say 'Til death do you part.' That's what you say in the marriage vows - make that vow, stay together forever. The divorce rate is sky high, so everybody's just lying their asses off. Why don't we come clean? Let's be honest, you know? Instead of standing there saying 'Til death do you part,' let's just go, 'I'll give it a shot.'"
Wanda Sykes,,"Actually, I majored in marketing and I have a bachelor of science."
Wanda Sykes,,"I'm not politically correct. I still say 'black,' I do. Because 'African American' - there's no bonus; it's not going to make your life any easier. You don't see black people standing around going, 'Woo yeah, African American. Man, I tell you, this beats the hell out of being black. We should have made the switch years ago.'"
Wanda Sykes,money,"We spend $48 million in lottery tickets. You can’t trust us with out money. ""How you planning for your retirement?"" ""Powerball."""

Wanda Sykes,,"It seems like when I first started, people got into comedy because they wanted to be good comedians."
Wanda Sykes,,"I did a benefit for a feminist organization. Now benefit means 'no money,' so I should be able to say what I want to say. And I figured if I pissed them off, who cares? What, they're going to get mad and pay me? So it's all feminists - Gloria Steinem's sitting right up front. So, I walk out there, and I'm like, 'Hey look, I can't stay here too long with you broads because I got to get home and cook my man a nice hot dinner.'"
Wanda Sykes,"men,women,dogs,hate",I hate when women compare men to dogs. Men are not dogs. Dogs are loyal. I’ve never found any strange panties in my dog’s house.

He is huge. Hey, are they supposed to be that big?' And he was like, 'Uh, uh - don't pay that any mind. They just do that with lights and stuff, that's all.' I was like, 'Well, shoot, we need to get some lights up in here.'"
Wanda Sykes,,"The president is on national TV apologizing for getting oral sex. Why didn't he just stick with his lie? You got to stick with your lie. If you lie, you have to believe that lie whole-heartedly. It has to become the truth for you. But this man, the most powerful man in the world, is on national TV apologizing for receiving oral sex. He's an idiot. There are men sitting in here right now who would gladly accept oral sex on national TV."

I'll show up at the family reunion in a dirty t-shirt and a bald cap - 'Look, everybody, I'm Uncle Earl.'"
Wanda Sykes,,"That's what they want: two women. Fellas, I think that's a bit lofty. Because, come on, think about it - if you can't satisfy that one woman, why do you want to piss off another one? Why have two angry women in the bed with you at the same time? And think about it - you know how much you hate to talk after sex, imagine having two women just nagging you to death."

You know, we're going to stay here with the kids tonight. Yeah, you know, they're a lot of work, but they're worth it. Maybe next week we can go hang out or something - What? Oh, you're going on vacation next week. Well isn't that nice? That's just nice. Where you going, where you going? Jamaica! Wooo! Yeah, that's beautiful.

Wanda Sykes,,"Comedy Central, they told me I had to watch my language because, the woman said, they had 'standards and practices.' I was like, wait a minute - you're Comedy Central. Aren't you the network where your number one show is a cartoon with a talking piece of shit?"
Wanda Sykes,,"People say, 'Well don't you regret not having kids?' And I go, 'No, not really.' And then if they keep asking, I always say this, 'Well, you know, maybe I'll adopt.' But I don't mean that. It's just something I say to make me sound like a nicer person."

Wanda Sykes,"family,christmas","I love my family but my family - they're the type of people that never let you forget anything you ever did when you were little. I was in the first grade Christmas play - I'm playing Mary. Now, during the course of the play, I dropped the baby Jesus. They act like I dropped the baby Jesus. So now, they still talk about this. I go to my family reunion, and one of my cousins just had a baby. So I'm like, 'Oh, that's a cute little baby. Let me hold the baby. Let me see the baby.' And my aunt runs over, 'Don't you give her that baby! You know she dropped the baby Jesus!'"
Wanda Sykes,"husband,dating","There's nothing wrong with dating younger men. My husband and I, we get along except for music because music dates you. He loves hip-hop - that's his thing, he loves rap music - but I like jazz. But he's started to enjoy jazz because I like to listen to jazz while we're having sex. Yeah, right, so now he loves jazz because he associates it with sex. He hears that jazz, he's like, 'That's my cue! It's on now!' But now, I can't even enjoy my music. I'm listening to Miles Davis, washing dishes. I turn around, he's standing there butt naked: 'Did ya call me?'"
Wanda Sykes,ice cream,"I have nephews. They love spending time with us. T they love it because we let them do whatever they want to do - they're not our kids, we don't care.

Wanda Sykes,,"Guys don't buy you free drinks like they used to. They don't. Remember the good old days? You'd go to your local bar, and the bartender would come over and say, 'Excuse me, ma'am, the gentleman way over there in the corner, he would like to buy you a drink.' You would say, 'OK, thank you. Beautiful.' And you would get your drink, and then the greatest thing of all - he would keep his ass way over there in the corner and leave you the hell alone."
Wanda Sykes,,"That's proof right there that men and women are on different levels because men can watch two women together and that's a turn-on. It doesn't work the same way for us, does it, ladies? No, uh-uh - it doesn't work the same. You ask any woman in here her sexual fantasy, and I will bet you a million dollars that it's NOT to go home and catch your man bent over with some big, burly guy standing behind him."
Wanda Sykes,,"My girlfriend called me because one of our other friends is getting married. So, they told me I had to pitch in for a male stripper. I said, 'You out your damn mind. I ain't payin' for no naked-ass man.' I mean, you think about it - women? We really don't have to pay to see that. I mean, really - we spend most of our time trying not to see that."

Wanda Sykes,,"Whenever we go out, I pay all the tolls. Yeah - he backs up to the tolls so the booth would be on my side."
Wanda Sykes,,"I don't go out with my single friends - not at all - because I never have a good time, never have fun. We go to a club, a guy comes over - 'Hey, can I buy you a drink?' They're like, 'No, she's married.' I'm like, 'Yeah, I'm married, but I'm thirsty. Why don't you shut the hell up, and let me have a free drink?'"
Wanda Sykes,,"You know when a relationship goes bad, man. You can tell when it goes bad when the sexual fantasies start getting all dark and everything. I was in this relationship, and he was like, 'Come on, come on - what's your fantasy?' And I was like, 'Well, I woke up, and you were dead.'"
Wanda Sykes,,"Our air quality's all messed up now. Knew that was coming when they lowered the emissions standards. Knew that was gonna happen when he appointed Christine Whitman head of the EPA. Yeah, the governor of New Jersey is head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Do you know how dirty New Jersey is?"
Wanda Sykes,,"Some black people want to get in touch with their African roots. But then you got some black people that just don't give a damn. You tell them, 'Hey, I just got back from the motherland.' They're like, 'Where'd you go - Detroit? Did you see The Temptations?'"

Wanda Sykes,,I always want to go back and do stand-up; I like the freedom.
Wanda Sykes,,"But sometimes the women writers will pitch something and I'll hear it, but the men will keep talking."
Wanda Sykes,,And then also I think it's harder for women because comedy is so opposite of being ladylike.
Wanda Sykes,,"If something stinks, I say it stinks. But I try to massage it a little and not be as cutting, come behind it with a joke: Hey, I cut you deep, but now let me put a couple of stitches in you."
Wanda Sykes,,A woman would pitch a joke. Nothing. Then a guy would pitch it and everybody would laugh.

Wanda Sykes,divorce,"I can hear my mother now: 'What? Oh, you gonna get a divorce? It's just that easy, huh? Things get hard, things get rough - you just want to throw in the towel, just like that.

Wanda Sykes,asians,"As soon as he turned pro and he won his first tournament, I read, 'Bi-racial golfer wins first tournament.' Oh, OK - 50/50: he's 50% black, 50% Asian. Alright, cool. Then after he won the masters, I'm flipping through Sports Illustrated, and I read, 'Tiger Woods is a quarter black,' and I'm like, 'Damn, he's down to 25% now, man. What the hell is going on? They're treating him like he's milk.'"
Wanda Sykes,,"I was really gifted at being able to construct a joke, but it's like they weren't even memorable, my first jokes, because they were so about nothing."
Wanda Sykes,,"But I understand that relationship; I understand how the mother-in-law, daughter-in-law relationship has so many conflicts because it's so forced."
Wanda Sykes,,It wasn't until I became more confident with myself and I put myself forward instead of the jokes; at first it was put the jokes out there and I'm just behind the jokes.

Wanda Sykes,jail,"They pulled out that dress, man - they scared him, they scared him. That little dress with the DNA - he lost it; he gave up the lie. But my thing is, who's going to believe a woman who keeps a nasty dress? They ought to toss that right out of court: 'Excuse me, your honor, she kept the dress.' 'What?
