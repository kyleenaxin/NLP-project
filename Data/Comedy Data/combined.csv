Adam Carolla,"You shouldn't be eating anything that takes six minutes to microwave. || If the rich are evil why are you sitting in their library? Why are you sitting in their hall? Why did I just listen to a whole show on orangutans with no commercials that they paid for? || Nature knew what she was doing when she figured out the penis and the cunt. || My life is about building and working and wrenching on some cars. || It’s something I’ve always kicked around, not doing the eBook but the ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" thing. || Right now, I hope it's later rather than sooner. || The God's honest truth is that I'm probably funnier, but he's smarter. Here's the thing about Stern - he's really a smart guy. He's nutty. He's outrageous. He's all those things, but he's also a very smart guy. || He has a great sense of humor - but it's in his assembly. It's really his craftsmanship that people overlook. It's not being fair to him just calling him outrageous. || Maybe it's weird, but I don't feel in any way, shape or form that I'm taking over his show. || If you are tuning in just for the show, you're going to be sorely disappointed. || When you do television, there's more to do, and when you do new television, there's a lot more to do, especially when you don't have partner. I miss not having that person. || I'd be at someone's house or be up on the roof all day and I'd get lonely - stir crazy - and talk radio became this soothing voice in my life. But the idea that I was making $10 an hour and stacking drywall while these guys were making a few hundred thousand, and they were having a party, and there were Playmates and there were good times, I just couldn't imagine it. || I got drunk in Canada. I was there for 2 days but I was drunk there for 4 days. I don't know how it worked. I guess it was with the time difference or something. || The Aston Martin is a beautiful car. It's a work of art, I love the interior and the style of the car. || Mmm, tastes like hepatitis! || Figure out what to do, then take a nap. || If you're a guy, you have absolutely no idea what's going on at any time in the relationship, ever. Here's what you know: you know when you're getting laid, and you know when it's all over. Those are the only two things you're aware of. || It's like the Fouth of July in my underpants. || All TV is, is really: ""Don't you want to be this, aren't you glad you're not that."" There's nothing really in the middle. || I'm really just trying to hash out the next two weeks of my life. So, something that is potentially four months down the road is not just a mile down the road for me, it's a million miles down the road. || Spontaneous, clever, specific, oblique and at the same time very human. || I spoke to my dad, and he said it took close to 90 dollars to raise me. But that was me and my sister, and my sister moved out when she was 16, so sometimes it can knock you up to triple digits to raise a kid. || My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of ""if you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your taxes, you should be able to just do what you want to do."" It's the freedom and the independence. || Oprah tells women what to read, what to eat, what to think, what to do... || There's no math equation that equals ratings or demographics or even takes into consideration ""The Man Show"". What the fuck is ""The Man Show"" audience? You either go up there and connect, or you go up there and you don't connect. || Everyone keeps saying, ""Oh my God, oh my God, how intimidating."" It's like saying, ""How could you date Jennifer Aniston after she's been with Brad Pitt?"" I don't care. || I urge all our listeners to masturbate. Right now. Because it takes the wind right out of the sex drive. We don't want rapists going into society half-cocked and ready to go. If they masturbate, they'll say, ""Uhh... I think I'll rape tomorrow instead."" || I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don’t think there is no God; I know there’s no God. I know there’s no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there’s no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won’t admit it because there’s another thing they know. They know they’re going to die and it freaks them out. So most people don’t have the courage to admit there’s no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out. || When I am king, I will revise the sexual bases system so that getting to first base will include oral sex and sodomy! || It should be like a salmon taking to open water. I've done so much morning radio that I won't be overwhelmed by it, but it's still going to be a challenge. || What happens is fucking say you can do the joke, but what they're going to do is take your beautiful broth and dump a pillowcase full of flour into it. Then, they say you can still have your broth, but it's not so good anymore, and ultimately it's the people who get the crappy soup because they're worried about the one guy who is allergic to it and not the rest of us. || This is why the terrorists hate us. And it’s not the glitter and it’s not the pomp and circumstance. We’ve got black and white, we’ve got Hispanic and Asian, we got gay, straight, and Guttenberg, all working together for one common goal: to get the mirror ball. And the mirror ball doesn’t care what color you are, and it doesn’t care how rich your parents are, and it doesn’t care what God you pray to. It’s an even wooden floor, and may the best man or woman win. And I say God bless Dancing with the Stars, and God bless the USA. || My son I worry about. I'm pretty sure he's gonna be gay. At this point I'm just hoping he's not a bottom. Sorry to sound closed-minded and uptight, but let's face it, no dad wants his son to be gay. Not only do you get no grandkids, but I'm sure high school is no picnic for a fifteen-year-old gay boy. On the other hand, maybe I'm just viewing this through the bifocals of an old heterosexual dude. The way things are going, my son will probably get his ass kicked for not being gay. ""Carolla thinks he's too good to suck cock. Come on boys, lets get him."" || I had two thoughts about it. One was I could do that, and the next one was I'll never get to do that."
Adam Ferrara,"Ladies, your happiness is very important to us. You have to understand that. Because when you're happy, you let us touch you. || Men tend to lie when it comes to sexual conquests. You should hear some of the ego-driven lies my friends have told me: ""Swear to God, man - the hooker gave the money back."" || I woke up my pop in the middle of the night 'cause the boogie man's under my bed. My pop is this big, huge man, nothing can hurt him. I went running into his bedroom like, ""Daddy, Daddy, the boogie man's under the bed!"" Pop opens one eye, he's like, ""Is the boogie man bigger than me?"" ""Well, no Daddy, he's not."" ""Well, you got your choice: you can deal with the boogie man or you can deal with me."" || You were an altar boy, right? No wonder you're so angry. Show me on Kiefer Sutherland where the priest touched you. || My favourite Catholic holiday is Easter. For those of you that don't know, Easter is the day we celebrate Jesus rising from the grave and coming back to Earth as a rabbit that hides coloured eggs. || I sincerely want to meet the girl that was meant for me, but I want to sleep with the girls that weren't. || Being in a relationship is like being in A.A. My friends ask me, ""How's it going with that girl?"" ""One day at a time, man."" || If she gets a hot flash and walks into a cold room, she can make it rain. || The human body is in constant change the minute we're born. It's in a constant state of decay. We're all like Ford Escorts, just falling apart. || I love that magazine, man - Victoria's Secret - and it comes, like, every three hours. || I don't think it's fair - you get married, you give your wife a wedding ring. I think you should give her a mood ring. Oh, it may sound crass, but just check the color when you come home. ""Hi honey. Infernal red? Oh boy, I ain't getting laid, and I gotta cut the lawn, I know it."" || I think human arrogance will be the demise of civilization. || What if God's a woman? Not only am I going to hell, I'll never know why! || The biggest thing in my life right now is my girlfriend. I love this girl. I know I love her because she told me. || There were many reasons we broke up. There was a religious difference: I'm a Catholic, and she's the devil. || I don't think I'll ever meet the perfect woman. I might have to get me one of them mail order women. You can do that: you send away to the Philippines, and they send you a wife. The only thing is, once you're on their mailing list, they keep sending you a relative a month whether you want it or not. || Whenever she uses the phrase ""I was thinking...,"" that means I either have to move, paint or buy something. || I love my girlfriend, don't get me wrong. I truly love this woman, but I have the ability to have sex without any emotional involvement. It's a gift. || We're all products of our parents: all your mother's traits are in the egg and all your father's traits are in the sperm. And if I know my parents, that sperm and egg had a fight. || As soon as you lay down, that's when the most bizarre things start coming out of her mouth. ""Goodnight, baby."" ""Do you think we were together in a past life?"" ""Yeah, and I died of sleep deprivation. Go to bed."" ""Don't you feel like we're soul..."" || You gotta fight. You gotta get out the negative energy. Don't let it build up. You end up screaming at each other over something totally stupid, like, ""Well, why'd you put this spoon in this drawer then?"" Just to piss you off, that's why! I got spoons hidden all over this house! Keep it up, and your napkin rings are gonna start disappearing. || If you look at a group of people that had faith, it's got to be the Jews. They followed Moses through the desert for 40 years with no map. There had to be one guy in the back, like, ""I don't think he knows where he's going."" || I love to believe that there's one god but there's many different religions so there's just the question of which long distance company you pick. || One day in the shower, you figure it out. It's a special day in a man's life. I was like, ""Oh, I found me a hobby."" || I talk a lot about women in my act, 'cause let's face it - if I was hungry, I would talk about food. || My girlfriend wants to get married. I tell you - I hope she meets somebody nice. || I am a Catholic. Basically, the Catholic religion is ""If it feels good - stop."" || My father tried to give me the sex talk once, and he chickened out. He walked into my room and went, ""Adam - uh, don't kiss guys."" || The only marriage I've observed for any length of time is my parents - 35 years. I asked my pop, I go, ""Pop, 35 years - what do you hope for?"" He's like, ""I hope you die first."" || I know she's just trying to make things nice, so I do my part. Now, when I get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, I turn on the light. I used to just go by sonar: just keep peeing 'til you hear water. || Sex is important to guys. We need stories to tell our friends. || My fondest childhood memory is I made out with my babysitter, Cathy. She stops in the middle of everything: ""We have to stop this. I feel like such a whore."" ""Why? I'm not paying you - my parents are! Come here!"" || I look to nature because I think the animals are smarter than we are. Animals mate; humans date. There's no dating in the animal kingdom. No dinner, no movie - just a quick sniff, ""Alright, let's go."" || The girls are beautiful in Hollywood - and enough silicon to caulk a sink. || That's the perfect microcosm for men and women: it takes a million sperm to find one egg 'cause they're all males and not one of them is gonna pull over and ask directions."
Adam Sandler,"Comedy, such a lovely lady, she'll pick you up, if you're feeling blue. || Now that's what I call high quality H2O. || I think the reason I don't read is because, when I'm reading, I feel like I'm missing out on something else. You know, What are my friends doing? Where's my girlfriend? || They should name a gender after you. Looking at you doesn't do it, staring is the only way that makes sense. And trying not to blink so you don't miss anything. And all of that and you're you. || I'm 31 now. I think I'm beginning to understand what life is, what romance is, and what a relationship means. || I'm not looking to get away from anything. I like what I've done. I like what I get to do and I enjoy working with my friends. I loved those movies, but this is incredible. || I don't laugh at me. I used to. I used to get the giggles when I'd see myself. But now, I see myself onscreen, and I sure don't laugh. || I can’t run a company… I can’t even run my own life! || My comedy is different every time I do it. I don't know what the hell I'm doing. || I never had a speech from my father ""this is what you must do or shouldn't do"" but I just learned to be led by example. My father wasn't perfect. || It definitely has learning a lesson about the way you're living your life. I wouldn't compare our movie to that, but it has a structure where it's about a man who doesn't appreciate all that he has and finds out at the end that life has been great and he has to enjoy that. || So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink, put you to bed when you've had too much to drink. || I sing seriously to my mom on the phone. To put her to sleep, I have to sing ""Maria"" from West Side Story. When I hear her snoring, I hang up. || Mama says that, alligators are onry cause they got all them teeth, but no toothbrush... || I don't think about that. I wasn't a kid growing up saying one day I'll get an Oscar and make a speech. That wasn't on my mind. So what I do is the best work I can do. || I guess in my house when I was growing up, I was comfortable trying to be funny. And my dad, of course, it bugged him sometimes. He was trying to rest, and I was constantly trying to say something stupid to get a reaction. But I like doing these movies. You can do it in front of the camera and then it's over. I don't have to worry about being in front of too many people. || I don't like being out in public too much. I don't like going to bars. I don't like doing celebrity stuff. || Sorry I’m not better looking. || If I saw myself dressed like that, I'd have to kick my own ass. || Its too damn hot for a penguin to be just walkin’ around here. || Its too hot for a penguin out here come here mister penguin. || Chemistry can be a good and bad thing. Chemistry is good when you make love with it. Chemistry is bad when you make crack with it. || Golf requires goofy pants and a fat ass. || Doing Saturday Night Live definitely affects my relationship with my girlfriend and with my family, because you feel so much pressure to do well that night. But I think everyone's grown to accept that and so they give me my space at the show. || Feels good to try, but playing a father, I'm getting a little older. I see now that I'm taking it more serious and I do want that lifestyle. || I do love the films I've done in the past. I work hard in my movies and my friends work hard and we're trying to make people laugh and I'm very proud of that. || I shouldn't be near Vegas and have money in my pocket. || Most of the stuff I do on the show comes out of me just trying to make my friends laugh. || I still like doing stand-up now, but it's not the same. It used to be that I was out there with five other comedians. Now I usually just do it alone. || My movies just kind of sneak up on you. I don't have to worry too much about what everybody is going to say. Anyway, I really don't pay attention to what the world says about my movies. I just care about what my buddies think. || I do want children. I study dads more. I watch what they go through. I admire my father more than I ever did and my brother and my sister. || He has a 5 year plan... What is it, don't die? || I don't want want to go to jail, I'm fragile. || I bought my parents some stuff. That feels kind of good to be able to do that. I got them a place in Florida. I think I'm allowed to say that - I hope my dad doesn't get mad at me. But I don't spend money on myself. I don't like myself enough yet. But the people I love, I like spending the cash on them. || I'd like to have a kid, and I'd like to be driving around. I know a kid is going to be a big part of my life. I can trust my kid. I know my kid would be in the backseat of my car, and when I say ""You wanna get some ice-cream?"" he's going to be happy. My brother has kids. I see that trick work, the ice cream trick. || You know, when you don't go on TV and talk about how many women you sleep with, some people in Hollywood, that are supposedly ""in the know"", start whispering that you're gay. If I were gay, I wouldn't be ashamed to admit it, but I'm not. || I’ve got a hockey record, I took off my skate and tried to stab a guy, I’m the only person who ever tried that. || Stop looking at me swan. || Well, we're living in a material world, and I'm a material girl... or boy. || Well I have a microphone and you don't so you will listen to every damn word I have to say! || Sir one more comment like that and I will strangle you with my microphone wire! || Having a kid is great... as long as his eyes are closed and he's not moving or talking. || Mama says that, happiness is from magic rays of sunshine that come down when you're feeling blue... || I still get very scared when I step in front of a live audience. || I sang a song at my sister's wedding. My mother forced me into that, too. But that one felt all right. || I don't know who I touch and who I don't. I work hard trying to make people laugh. I try to do the kind of stuff that made me laugh growing up. I don't have any secrets. I don't know the reasons I've been so well received. || Wasted is when you have a hankering for ice cream. || Never seen my friends do more push-ups, trying to challenge Cruises' manhood. It was like, ""I can be strong, too!"" || Now let's cut the stupid cake because I know the fat guy's gonna have a heart attack if we don't eat again soon. And while we do that here's a little mood music for you. || It's just weird that out of nowhere God said, ""May the three best-looking guys in Hollywood have babies - Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and me"". It was bizarre that God said, ""I want to make the planet more beautiful"", and I got the call. || I noticed you all were French, opposite of bonjour to you. || The problem with me, as far as getting married and having a family, is that my comedy is so important to me. So I don't know if I'll ever be as good a dad as my dad. || This character feels so much like my brother. He has two children. He has a wife. He works with me. He chooses to stay in New Hampshire because he wants his kids to grow up in the school they started with. He doesn't want them to lose friends. He is his family's hero. || To be honest with you, when I got into this I never thought about reviews. I never thought about what people would say about me. I was just a young guy who was excited to become a comedian and an actor and I just wanted to get to do what I got to do. || We just bought this house. It's too big. It's like 400,000 square feet, or something. We got an indoor lake and ski slope in the house! It's just too big. || When I got into this, I never thought about reviews. I never thought about what people would say about me, I was just a young guy who was excited to become a comedian and an actor, and I just wanted to get to do what I got to do. || When I was younger and did a stand-up gig, it would take me two weeks to recover. Sometimes I'd get so panicked that I would stutter. || I mean, I look at my dad. He was twenty when he started having a family, and he was always the coolest dad. He did everything for his kids, and he never made us feel like he was pressured. I know that it must be a great feeling to be a guy like that. || I drew the duck blue because I've never seen a blue duck before and, to be honest with you I wanted to see a blue duck. || When I'm up there, and I know the show's coming to a close, in my head I'm saying to myself, Oh man, you gotta get off and be a normal person again. That's what I don't like so much. || My buddies, we've always just tried to make each other laugh. I mean, just like all friends hanging out - that's the goal. || First I asked her what time it is, right? Tomorrow I get to ask her the date, the day after that she's all over me. That's how it works, you play it slow. || It's hard to soar with the eagles when you're surrounded by turkeys. || I'm filthy rich! It's good to be Adam Sandler! || And she showed me her boobies and I like them too! || I'm pretty hot, right? Very hot, if I may say so myself. Don't you feel the sex I'm radiating? || I'm not even worried about them getting sick of the characters. I want to make sure stuff is still funny to me. || Some of us will never ever find true love. Take, for instance me. And I'm pretty sure that guy right there. And that lady with the sideburns. And basically everybody at table nine. || Kid is healthy! Wife is healthy! || He was great enough to be loose and funny about it. || That was so much easier, I should just get it in one every time."
Al Madrigal,"If my wife has too much to drink at a party, starts yapping a little too much, I don't have to say anything... three little leg squeezes, she knows that means 'Put a sock in it, drunkie, time for you to wrap it up.' Somebody didn't have dinner like I suggested, now you're spouting off at the mouth divulging all the family secrets. You need to pipe down or we've got to fucking leave. || I'm half-Mexican - get used to it 'cause in about five to 10 years, you're all gonna be related to one. Whether you like it or not, no matter how much you prepared your family, you're gonna show up at Thanksgiving one of these years, you're gonna walk in and say, 'Hey! What's happening? Since when did we start serving flan?' Well, what's happening is that somebody's boning a Latino. || Don't bring your sand toys to the park. That's another bad move. Because I go to the park, and I'm on the Vicodin and a little weed too - let's face it - and I go in there, and my wife's like, 'Bring the sand toys! Bring the sand toys!' And I know what happens every single time: I become sand toy repo man from the eight little kids that run off in nine different directions with my sand toys. || That's what a pinata inspires. It's like, 'Hey kids, let's get your favorite cartoon character and let's lynch his ass. And then we're gonna all take turns beating the crap out of it until its guts come out. We can all scramble for its sugary entrails. Who's with me?!' || I like bourbon, any other detail beyond that is going to make me seem like a drunk. || So I go back, reluctantly, down a murky hallway to what looks like a Dollar Store dressing room, and I open up the dirty curtain. There's a velvet Elvis on the wall with the eyes cut out - some weird sort of quality assurance program they're running in there. They got a dirty recliner they pulled off the street with duct tape on it - God knows what else. They got a bloody pipe on the floor. It's like a third world game of Clue. || What's happening is there's a warm front of Mexicans that are humping their way north to the point where you'll be up in Canada one of these years, walking around, you'll be like: 'Hey look, Eskimos! They came down.' Those aren't Eskimos - they're Meximos: Mexicans in parkas, trying to have sex with Canadian women. || I got distracted by one of the hippie moms who was breastfeeding a kid that was way too old to be breastfeeding. You ever seen that before? It's disgusting. A child should not be old enough to comment on the quality. Like, 'Do you go to Cheesecake Factory, because this is delicious. It's like dulce de leche meets Riesling coming out of this thing, and I've got to say thank you.' || Then I get there and I swear - it's San Jose, CA - there's 2,000 Mexicans. And you know you're half-Mexican when you walk in and you're like, 'Damn. This is a lot of Mexicans. Only half of me is the only white guy here.' || I'm always alone. Sad face emoticon. || Well, once I fried tofu and put Sriracha on it. After that I was so depressed I swore off preparing food for myself altogether. || You grow up real quick, a half-Mexican in a sailor's suit, because I'd be riding the streetcar to school everyday - minding my own business, humming out a 'Frere Jacques' - and I realized that in any other town, this might be considered cute. But you know what it is in San Francisco? Sexy. || I bullshit on the phone all day with a variety of people discussing various projects, and occasionally write jokes. || Near my house in Los Angeles is a waterfall. I love to take the wife and kids, but it's also near a sketchy neighborhood. So there's a lot of gang members that hang out at the waterfall. It's like somebody took an Ansel Adams photo and then put a Cypress Hill video inside it. || We're down in Mexico. It's for a bachelor party, so we go into a Mexican strip club... I go back with this woman down a murky hallway, and then without missing a beat - these ladies are all business - she goes, 'Go ahead, take out your dong.' 'I'm not taking out my dong. And by the way, who uses the word ""dong""? If you want to be hip to the lingo, they're not using the word ""dong"" up in the States.' || My son comes out of his room wearing these flood pants with holes in both knees. I have no idea where he found these pants. And I go, 'Dude, you gotta change your pants. You can't wear those pants.' He goes, 'I like these pants, these are my favorite pants, I'm gonna wear them.' I didn't know what to say, I'm a young dad, so I go, 'You're gonna be embarrassed.' He looks at me, steps to me a little bit, and goes, 'I'm not gonna be embarrassed. They're your friends. You're gonna be embarrassed.' I was like, 'Son of a bitch.'"
Alan King,"However, even under the best of circumstances, four-year graduation rates for the next few years will be substantially lower than those in the three provinces. || The best definition of an honest politician is one who… when he is bought, stays bought. || If you want to read about love and marriage, you've got to buy two separate books. || Modesty is not one of my virtues. || Once they make their commitment, they have to stay with that commitment, ... They have to live with that decision. || A river in Cleveland caught fire… what did they put it out with? || Why spoil a good meal with a big tip? || If the banks are so friendly, how come they chain down the pens? || It was nice to see Chocolate outriding the Flat jockey. || I think he has a hell of a chance on rain softened ground and he probably represents our best chance for a Festival victory. || I was worried about the ground, and while I thought it was quicker than ideal, there was no jar. || Jesus saves, Moses invests. || As life's pleasures go, food is second only to sex. Except for salami and eggs. Now that's better than sex, but only if the salami is thickly sliced. || Marriage is nature's way of keeping us from fighting with strangers. || You do live longer with bran, but you spend the last fifteen years on the toilet. || Banks have a new image. Now you have a friend, your friendly banker. If the banks are so friendly, how come they chain down the pens? || I don't think it's any secret. We can't continue to do business as we're currently doing it. || Comedy is a reflection. We create nothing. We set no styles, no standards. We're reflections. It'a a distorted mirror in the fun house. We watch society. As society behaves, then we have the ability to make fun of it. || A short summary of every Jewish holiday: ""They tried to kill us; we won; let’s eat!"""
Albert Brooks,"Art and resistance are great together. That's what art's made for. Look at Vincent van Gogh: He didn't cut off his ear because he was selling well. || I'm not a person who I ever thought would do well with divorce. Not that it can't happen. I just didn't want that. So I waited a long time to meet the right person. Then I finally met someone that I was willing to be divorced from. || Being a screenwriter in Hollywood is like being a eunuch at an orgy. Worse, actually, at least the eunuch is allowed to watch. || My mother was supportive without knowing it. Deep down she wanted all the right things, she just didn't see the world like I did, and she's not supposed to. || Starting to drink now in preparation for New Years. No more last minute stuff like Christmas. || So I think if you're happy with your brain, you're powerful. || You can equate acting to a tennis game: When you're playing one of the best, you get better. || Acceptance is going to a restaurant where the salad's not great, but the steak is fine. || I've never been disappointed, because I've never given somebody I liked that much power. || I'd still like to see ""Survivor"" minus the planned show-biz parts. That would be the purest form of show business - I want to see someone so hungry that they eat somebody else's foot. || When I die, if the word ""thong"" appears in the first or second sentence of my obituary, I've screwed up. || When we spoke, he told me, 'The Newsweek thing has changed the world.' And I said, 'Wasn't it 9/11 that changed the world?' But Michael said he just didn't want to take a chance. || I've seen the future! It's a bald-headed man from New York! || I got so good at writing to a budget, my brain was restricting myself. I'd write, ""It's a stormy night."" Then I'd cross out stormy. I'd write: ""It's a calm night."" Then I'd cross out night. It's noon. Because you know how much night costs. You know how much rain costs. Nothing comes free in movies. || I don't know that I can define fear. But one of the sources of fear is holding up some sort of model life that doesn't exist and feeling like you're far away from it. || The biggest waste of brainpower is to want to change something that's not changeable. || In line for Black Friday 2012. Gonna get some killer deals. || If we had 3 million exhibitionists and only one voyeur, nobody could make any money. || I was in Kashmir last weekend. Went to visit one of my sweaters. || In the beginning of any career, in every job, people are always forcing you to the middle. || If anything happens to me tell every woman I've ever gone out with I was talking about her at the end. That way they'll have to reevaluate me. || Had an unexplained burst of happiness today. Doctor said not to worry it will go away. || The whole world is tense. Everybody gets the international news. There's been no American comedy at all that even remotely addresses the subject in any way. My goal isn't to solve the world's problems. My character wasn't even able to do his assignment. But the premise of wanting to find out about somebody - other than the stuff that the CIA will tell you - there's no hope unless we do that. || Excited about Black Friday. Also excited about Jew Tuesday. || I have children. I have a family to support. But I really could live in a one-room apartment, as long as the television worked. I never needed anything. Just a comfortable chair and I'm fine. || I feel so badly about what they do to turkeys. That's why this year my family and I are eating a live bird. || The world really changed after 9/11, not just in the tragic way, but in every way. So it took me a couple of years to even understand how my art form I could process any of this. When the world changed, eliciting laughter with subjects that were funny to me before 9/11 just didn't seem good enough. || There are a couple of images I really love in this movie. One is crossing into Pakistan illegally to see a group of guys who ordinarily you'd think would want to kill you, but they want to be stand-up comedians. || But I thought, what could I do in a teeny way - and believe me, it's a teeny way - to defuse this? There had to be some way to separate the 1.5 billion people who don't want to kill us from the 100,000 or so who do. I thought if I could get five Muslims and six Hindus and maybe 3 Jews to laugh for 90 minutes, then I've accomplished something. || This was enormously challenging, because it involved filling 120 blank pages with an actual story and words people say. || We export films that are full of sleazy jokes and toilet humor - that`s why we've earned the affectionate nickname of the Great Satan. What's seemingly benign, by our standards, is doing more damage to us around the world than anything I could ever do. || It's better to be known by six people for something you're proud of than by 60 million for something you're not. || I'm not interesting enough on my own that you'd want to see a film about me. || I come from the place where I am thinking ""I have put my blood on the pages."" || Relaxation is the absence of worry. || There's nothing funny about flying to Houston. || Even if you didn't see the movie, you'd see two words you'd never seen put together before - comedy and Muslim. Comedy is friendly - it's the least offensive word in our language. || Bullfights are hugely popular because you can sit comfortably with a hot dog and possibly watch a man die. It won't be me, but I can sit comfortably and watch it. || I don't want to get close to people who have secrets that I don't know about. || I've always felt like I work in a small little area that doesn't represent anything like the rest of society. || When they made 90210, there were people outside of Beverly Hills who went, Oooooh! But you don't go Oooooh! when you're in there. You're worried about passing the Spanish test."
Alonzo Bodden,"I don't like conservatives. They always talk about the ""good old days"". I'm black, we have no ""good old days"". || There are three goals for any comedian: to make a living as a comedian; I've been fortunate to do that. To make a name for yourself and to be famous would be great - because it would give me that freedom. || I was teaching airplane mechanics when I realized it was more fun to make them laugh. I was laid off one more time and I never looked back, although it was nice to have a steady paycheck and benefits. || Every day theres something new. Something's going to destroy us all. Then it disappears. || Black people don't hijack planes, alright? Now I'll be the first to admit, we steal a lot of stuff, but we do not hijack planes. In fact, in the history of aviation, a black person has never even attempted to hijack a plane. Do you want to know why? Because you can't sell an airplane. || Scientists are trying to invent Viagra for women. It's been along for years... it's called cash. || The difference, generally speaking, between sportbike people and cruiser people is that sportbike people like performance skill and wear safety gear; cruisers like chrome, noise, and style. It's funny to me to separate them because I ride both. I prefer performance cruisers like the Honda Valkyrie I had or my Triumph Rocket III. || I wish airplanes were more like elementary school with someone up front telling everyone to sit down and shut up. || Watching news showing all the same sex marriages. How long before first same sex divorce? || This guy asked me to go camping on vacation. Camping - that's the dumbest vacation I ever heard of in my life. What, I'm gonna work all year so I can go out and pretend I'm homeless? || I was on the highway - I saw the scariest thing in the world, man. I saw an Asian driving an SUV. Really, I just drove my car right into the guardrail, figured I'd save him some time. || I could always make people laugh. || There's always something that's going to kill us all. A few years ago, tomatoes were going to kill us and a few years before that it was spinach. The FDA is run by a 7-year-old kid that hates vegetables! || I got to be funny, I can't dunk. || I didn’t understand NASCAR until I met some NASCAR fans. You talk to a couple of NASCAR fans and you’ll see where a shiny car driving in a circle would fascinate them all day. I can make fun of NASCAR fans because if they chase me, I just turn right. || You know who's mad at Kobe? Every other player in the NBA. You know why? 'Cause he messed around on his wife and bought her a $4 million ring. Yeah, you know what that means: that's the new minimum. 'Cause you know how women are, man. Women get upset: 'Oh, really, what's this? A $1 million ring? What - did that bitch get my $3 million, too?' || Latinos outnumber Black people now. I’m not too happy about it. Because it’s only a matter of time before we lose our month. Soon as they figure it out, they’re going to have Latino History Month. All we’re going to have is Cinco de Negro. || I like white women. That’s why I can’t hate white men. Because we need them for breeding. Sometimes I’m hanging with the brothers, and they get a little militant on me. They’re like, “Kill Whitey!” I’m like, “Slow down. Let’s think this through now.” || I used to be an airplane mechanic until they started drug testing. That's when I knew it was time to let that one go. And people ask me about that; they're like, 'Is that true man? Did you really do drugs?' 'Yeah.' 'Why would you do drugs?' 'They work.' || You can't bring tweezers on an airplane. If I'm on a plane and you try to hijack it with tweezers, I'll whip your ass, man. You think I'm going to be late because you've got tweezers and a bad attitude? || I’m a black male, over 40, with no kids, living in the suburbs - they wanted to put me in a museum. Why did I move to the suburbs? I started watching Desperate Housewives. If comedy didn’t work out I can always try gardening. || We had one idiot put a bomb in a shoe, and now everybody's got to take their shoes off? Where's the bra bomber at? I say, if we've gotta wait in line, let's make it fun for everybody. || I wasn't always a comic, I used to do honest work. || A joke is either funny or it's not funny. If I hear a funny joke, you know what I do? I laugh, that's what I do. I don't start a focus group to see who got hurt by the joke. || I work out with alot of gay guys at the gym. I do, because my only goal is to get into ""gay shape"". Now, you know what I'm talking about. Gay men are the most ripped kind of... listen... I don't know how strong you have to be to blow a guy, but I'm guessin', there is some muscle involved. || Comedy is the drug, when they laugh it's like I'm a jazz musician and they hear it, and they get it. It's power to take the crowd wherever I want them to go. I love it when they laugh, especially when they relate through laughter. It's a beautiful thing. It also means I'm going to get paid, which is nice. || I grew up in the suburbs. I’m an angry suburban nergo. I’m bad in, like, Starbucks. I’ll hurt you over a frappuccino. || In a relationship you have to communicate, which means listening to her talk. Ladies, you fake orgasms. We fake listening. || They sold me a duvet cover, and I don't have a duvet, I don't think. Then, they started treating me like I'm the idiot. They're like, 'Do you have a comforter?' 'Yeah.' 'Well, you have to protect it!' I had no idea it was under attack. || I like psycho chicks... Yeah, you hook up with a psycho, you're gonna learn something. First thing you learn is how to sleep with one eye open. || Women like jewelry. They’re like racoons: show them some shiny stuff and they’ll follow you home."
Amy Schumer,"My comedy is unapologetic and fearless. Like, sometimes you'll wind up having condomless sex with someone that you probably shouldn't. I'm interested in sharing that part of myself unapologetically so that other people will hopefully feel better. || I went home with this French guy 'cause he said something adorable, like, 'I have an apartment.' || Now every idiot from high school's like, 'I'm back!' We weren't supposed to meet again. Stop poking me and inviting me to your weird vampire parties. No, I don't want to follow you on Twatter. Like, nobody's interested in you. I don't want to see you in real life, why would I want to follow you in the imaginary one? || He was really into family... He'd never come on the road with me on the weekends 'cause he wanted to spend time with his wife. || We had to break up, though. We wanted different things - like he wanted kids and I wanted him to hear. || I just say what I think is the funniest thing I could say. I'm not trying to make headlines. I'm just trying to say the stuff that I think is funny and will make people laugh. || I think you can go from being not very funny to working really hard for 10 years and figuring out how to make a living on the road, but I don't think you can rise much above that. || It's a weird age. They're like, 'Amy, I'm pregnant.' And I still don't know whether to be like, 'Congratulations,' or 'Do you need a ride?' || No one’s ever cum on my face. That surprises a lot of people. Never caught one up top as they say in the biz. || The last couple of roles I missed out on went to Jennifer Hudson, Jessica Biel and Olivia Wilde. || I donated blood today. That's what I call getting an AIDS test. || To be really great, you need to be naturally funny in order to stand out. But you can work at it, and find the best vehicle that you have to communicate what you're saying to people. || You know that show 'Teen Mom'? Or if you're from the South, 'Mom.' || It says, 'It's safest to let them sleep alone, especially if you drink, use drugs or are overweight.' Yeah, I thought that was weird, too. But if you think about it, if you're drunk, stoned or really fat, in the middle of the night, that baby might look delicious. I've eaten weirder things. || My friends all got really into that show 'The Deadliest Catch.' But I never watched it 'cause I always just assumed it was about AIDS. It's about crabs. Don't tune in looking for that 'Big AIDS Hour.' || Nothing good ever happens in a blackout. I've never woken up and been like, 'What is this Pilates mat doing out?' || I tend to eat pretty healthy, though, and I work out - I work out hard. || The way that these girls keep themselves skinny is awful, isn't it? By vomiting or using hard drugs - which I can't afford. || I usually feel pretty good about myself. I know what I look like. You’d bang me, but you wouldn’t blog about it. You won’t be Twittering “You won’t believe who I’m inside.” It’s fine. || I may sound like a megalomaniac, but I feel like I'm equipped to become a great, memorable comedian, if I keep working my ass off and staying at the pace I'm at, and I feel a responsibility to do that because of the women who have done it before me, and the ones who need to do it after me. || You shoot saltwater in your ass? || I made out with a homeless guy by accident. I had no idea -- he was really tan, he had no shoes on. I just thought it was, like, his thang, you know? I was like, 'He's probably in a band.' || I'm so in love with my boyfriend right now. Everything is perfect, but we want totally different things in bed. Like, he's always turning the lights on, you know what I'm saying? And I shut them off, and he turns them on, and the other day, he's like, 'Amy, why are you so shy? You know, you have a beautiful body.' I was like, 'Oh my god, you're so cute. You think I don't want you to see me?' || The girls I grew up with they're living normal, adult lives. So they call me now and they're like, 'Amy, I'm pregnant.' And I still react like, 'What are you going to do? I'll drive you, I guess.' || I don't think that's a cute accent on dudes - the French accent. It makes my vagina shut like a steel trap. I mean, thank god for that other hole. || You feel like such a dirty whore buying plan b. It is so embarrassing because it’s over the counter but you have to ask you pharmacist, and they know what you want but they make you ask. They’re lookin’ at me, I’m like, you see where my eyeliner is just give it to me. || I just went through a break up, actually. I'm not worried about meeting someone else or being lonely. I'm just worried about all the pictures. But my mom always told me, you know, ever since I was a little girl, 'Never put your face in them.' || I was actually on two reality shows, which is crazy. Just to think that, out there, there was some guy, like flipping through the channels, being like, 'Hey, I 69'd her on a cruise ship.' || My mom's always saying really smart things... like, you probably heard this one, 'Why buy the cow when the milk has HPV?' Wish I'd listened to that one. || I have an excuse, actually, why I've been drinking so much. I haven't said this out loud yet - this is exciting - I'm drinking for two. Thank you, wow. I mean, just for now. Somebody's being evicted. || I feel like you know what you're going to be good at when you're older based on what you like when you're younger. When I was younger my best friend was Tony, this kid Tony, and he loved rocks. He was always playing with rocks, counting them, and now he's a crack head. || It's work having a vagina. Guys don't think that its work but it is. You think it shows up like that to the event? It doesn't. Every night it's like getting it ready for its first Quinceanera, believe me. || My mom is very good at being passive-aggressive, and my Dad is a total wise-ass, so I think the mixture of the two of them is my comedy. || There's nothing more awkward than going to the first birthday party of a little girl when you told her mom to get rid of her - because the kid can tell. || You know what they say: 'Once you go black, your parents don't talk to you anymore.' || I've always been really dark, and drawn to darker humor. Nothing has been forced, and I don't say anything for shock value. || My background is in theater. I was a theater major in college. || Don't feel bad for me. I think I'm, like, so pretty. || I asked for a glass of Chardonnay. And in a 9/11-like twist, they didn't have any. They offered me Pinot. || You know what the worst part about my drinking is? When I'm drunk I slur. You know, like I say racial slurs. Wow, nobody likes that at a barbeque. || I like to create stuff. I like to express myself through jokes. || Out of nowhere she tells me that Oliver Stone - you know, the director - she's like, 'He has this huge Asian fetish, and I find it totally offensive.' And I'm like, 'Why, Kwan? That sounds awesome.' She's like, 'I'm offended because I'm Asian.' And I was just like, 'Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't even notice that. I thought you were just really tired.' || I walked in on him masturbating. He's like, 'Are you mad?' I'm like, 'Uh no, but you seem to be. Holy shit. Does it owe you money?' || I'll never forget the day I realized I wasn't quite the Ford model I thought I was. || There's a plastic bag whirling around in the wind. Is it a bag full of shit? || Very neat for a boy; always cleaned up his mess, no matter where he got it on me. He's Hispanic, so he's like, 'Now who's the wetback?' I'm like, 'Hey, still you. Get back in the kitchen, those dishes aren't going to do themselves.' || Want me to Stevie Wonder my way to the bathroom? || She's always bragging about the dumbest stuff. The other day she was telling me, she's like, 'You know I can still fit in my wedding dress.' I was like, 'Oh my god, who cares, right?' I mean it is weird that she's the same size now as she was when she was 8 months pregnant. || In New York I'm, like, a six - seven with all the padding. But in Miami, I was like a negative three. People were like, 'What the fuck is that?' Throwing up on their motorized wheelchairs. Children were crying. I was like, 'Beyonce calls it jelly.' They were like, 'That's cottage cheese, bitch. Do some lunges.' || I feel very comfortable in my own skin. When someone makes jokes about me being heavy, it makes me mad. It's not true. I'm right where I should be. || You have to pretend like you want to use a condom. I like to say something fun when I bring it up, but honest. I'll be like, 'You're going to want to wear this. I've had a busy month.' || The kids didn't call me Amy Schumer; they called me Amy Jewmer. One summer, I'll never forget this, all the kids took turns throwing handfuls of pennies at me. I know, I was like, 'Excuse me - this is awesome!' || I finally just slept with my high school crush. But I swear; now he expects me to go to his graduation - like I know where I'm going to be in three years. || It's work having a vagina. Guys don't think that its work but it is. You think it shows up like that to the event? It doesn't. Every night it's like getting it ready for its first Quinceanera, believe me. || I hate false advertising, like 'Skittles: taste the rainbow.' No one's ever been like, 'Rainbow, right you guys?' Or what's Reese's? 'There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.' Oh, really? Tell that to my uncle who used to put them in my underwear. Alright, maybe your uncles didn't love you. || I think of myself as a fairly attractive girl and always have, thanks to my mom. I was brought into this world thinking I was gorgeous because my mother was extremely devoted to this notion. || Hey! Just at the cemetery, thinkin' boutcha."
Andrew Dice Clay,"If it smells like fish its a dish. If it smells like cologne leave it alone. || Don't most men actually think that the more money they spend on a date, the more fingers they get to stick in your pussy before they kiss you goodnight? || People are taking the act too seriously. The Diceman character is a macho moron. It's juvenile comedy. I just like to make people laugh. || Twinkle twinkle little star, Will she blow me in the car. I bought her dinner, she had fun. My balls are boiling, I'd like to come. || Life is like sex, baby - the more you put in, the more you get out. End of story. || C'mon baby, lose the bra. || Mother Goose? Yeah I fucked her. || Little Boy Blue - He needed the money. || I think the best part of being gay is when you're done, you could turn over and talk about football. || What am I looking at? I want to eat you like a tossed fucking salad! || When you jerk off, you’re saying “Hey, I care about me.” || Jack and Jill went up the hill Both with a buck and a quarter, Jill came down with $2.50. || I don't drink to get happy or to forget the pain. I drink to stop the voices in my head. Do you know what's so bad about them, they stutter. Ddddave... Kkkikikill your papapaparents! || I'm not the greatest husband - I've got a girlfriend. It doesn't really please my wife, but then if I was looking to please her I wouldn't have a girlfriend. I mean she knows about it, and I guess she's okay with it. Plus my kids like both of them. || I like a bush. A nice big, hairy, stinky, smelly fucking bush. And I hate when they put cologne on it. They dummy it up with cologne like you don’t know where you are. I like that nice natural scent of salmon. || If my girlfriend brings home a nice looking friend of hers, I fuck her on principal. You know what I mean? Don't throw another bush in front of my face. What do you think I'm gonna do? Talk to it? I'm gonna bang it."
Andy Kaufman,"While all the other kids were out playing ball and stuff, I used to stay in my room and imagine that there was a camera in the wall. And I used to really believe that I was putting on a television show and that it was going out to somewhere in the world. || I was just teasing in fun... || When you go through a tunnel - you're going on a train - you go through a tunnel, the tunnel is dark, but you're still going forward. Just remember that. But if you're not going to get up on stage for one night because you're discouraged or something, then the train is going to stop. Everytime you get up on stage, if it's a long tunnel, it's going to take a lot of times of going on stage before things get bright again. You keep going on stage, you go forward. Every night you go on stage. || We're hoping that this will also be the key to starting community events in a place where the whole community can come together. We've been working with the town on the total renovation. || That was part of the whole original concept. We were thinking, it's off-season, let's do a really fun, local-oriented event, raise money for good causes and bring some music to the valley. || When I perform, it's very personal. I'm sharing things I like, inviting the audience into my room. || My mother sent me to psychiatrists since the age of four because she didn't think little boys should be sad. When my brother was born, I stared out the window for days. Can you imagine that? || I never told a joke in my life. || There's no way to describe what I do. It's just me. || I try to please people, to give them a good time, but I refuse to make my act conform to traditional show-biz standards of entertainment. There's a little voice that says, 'Oh, no, you can't do that, that's breaking all the rules.' That's the voice of show business. Then this other little voice says, 'Try it.' And most of the time, when the voice comes on and says, 'No,' that's the time it works. || The critics try to intellectualize my materiel. There's no satire involved. Satire is a concept that can only be understood by adults. My stuff is straight, for people of all ages. || There's no drama like wrestling. || Pure entertainment is not an egotistical lady singing boring songs onstage for two hours and people in tuxes clapping whether they like it or not. It's the real performers on the street who can hold people's attention and keep them from walking away. || Whenever I play a role, whether it's good or bad, an evil person or nice person, I believe in being a purist and going all the way with the role. If I'm going to be a villainous wrestler, I believe in going all the way with it and not breaking character and not giving away to the audience that I'm playing a role. I believe in playing it straight to the hilt. || I just want real reactions. I want people to laugh from the gut, be sad from the gut, or get angry from the gut. || If I play my cards right, I could bring network wrestling back to TV. Unfortunately, to most people, wrestling is a laughingstock. But fortunately, I'm reaching people who otherwise wouldn't watch it. || What's real? What's not? That's what I do in my act, test how other people deal with reality. || I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. I don't even watch comedians. The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him. I've never done that in my life. My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can. I can manipulate people's reactions. There are different kinds of laughter. Gut laughter is where you don't have a choice, you've got to laugh. Gut laughter doesn't come from the intellect. And it's much harder for me to evoke now, because I'm known. They say, ""Oh wow, Andy Kaufman, he's a really funny guy."" But I'm not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads."
Andy Kindler,"I noticed whenever you call information, 411, there's always a computer voice, and they go, 'What number would you like? City and state, please.' 'Yeah, I'd like the number of Macy's in Century City, California.' 'Did you say 'pretzel nuggets'?' || I love whenever they downgrade a hurricane to a tropical depression, because I always think of a tropical depression as how I feel three songs into a Jimmy Buffett concert. || Now we have two choices in life: have sex with the same person forever or risk a terminal disease. Either way, your life is over. || I don't want to compare the Republicans to Nazis. I'm just saying, Dick Cheney would have had a nice time in Nazi Germany. || It's the same thing every week - every week. What do you think's going to happen? Oh, that guy's got a unibrow. You think they're going to talk about that? He's got cinder block bookshelves. You think that's going to come up? || Larry the Cable Guy has signed a deal with Cracker Barrel. Not the store. He signed a deal with a barrel full of angry rednecks. || When I was 8 years old, I entertained friends with my alligator hand puppet. Where’s my room in Vegas? || You know what's ironic is that I am against the death penalty, and yet, my porno name is Lethal Injection. Isn't that weird? || I don't know if it's the weather or what's going on - the summer or something like that - but recently I've been feeling extremely bisexual. I don't know what it is. I don't know what's going on, but I walked down the street and, suddenly, the ladies are looking awfully good to me. || I’m no sellout, literally. || Yesterday someone asked me in interviews why I was so self-deprecating. I told them it’s because I’m a stupid idiot who doesn’t deserve self esteem. || I believe at the end of my career I’ll be retired into the recurring character hall of fame. || I don’t believe in burning holy books, but I am organizing a protest. I’ll be burning all my Dennis Miller VHS cassettes as a special protest. I don’t want to hear the introduction ‘you may have seen our next comedian on the Hannity show’. || Someone told me Sean Hayes has agreed to star in the new version of the Three Stooges. The stars are starting to align. || Many Zookeeper sequels in the works. Paul Blart Mall Keeper, Kevin James interacts with talking berets at Lids. Then there’s Morning Zookeepers, where he’s a morning deejay and interacting with talking animals. || Here's a guy who's never faced combat or anything in his life - or really had a tough day - and he's like, 'Bring it on,' I love that. He's like, 'Ya got a problem? Bring it on. Over there. In Iraq. Where the troops are.' || Entertainment Weekly said that Parks and Rec is the smartest comedy on tv. Call me when it’s the funniest. || I don't remember much about my bar mitzvah. The only thing I remember - I killed! That's what I remembered. Nobody could follow me at my bar-mitzvah. It was over when I was done. || Once when Larry the Cable Guy was on Conan’s show, Conan O’Brien was so offended by Larry’s material, he had to walk away from the desk he was so offended. || I’m doing a roast as if the roast was pure rage and I wasn’t there to kid. || Pixar had to animate themselves jumping over a shark. || I’m Jewish… We’re a very nervous group. Paranoid. Anxiety-ridden. Maybe that Hitler thing made us a little jumpy. Nothing like a Holocaust to make you mind your Ps and Qs for a couple hundred years I always say. || They had a sign, and it said, 'Do not allow your dog to chase, injury or worry wildlife.' I understand the chasing and injuring part, but how is a dog going to 'worry' wildlife? Dog's going to run up to a bird: 'Hey, I think you've got something on your beak. It could be a tumor.' || I was in Philadelphia - a very angry town, Philadelphia. I've never seen a town like this. It's supposed to be the City of Brotherly Love - like when my brother was 12 and I was nine, and he would lean on my shoulder and dangle spit in my face. || If I don't believe in Jesus, maybe I don't believe in Hell. Did you ever think of that? You're so excited about it, why don't you go to Hell? It's your concept; you invented it. || I believe conspiracy theories are part of a larger conspiracy to distract us from the real conspiracy. String theory. || I actually performed at an orthodox Jewish wedding, where the men were separated from the women, but they both came together to not enjoy what I was talking about. || BJ Novak gets the Perseverance Award for graduating from Harvard and being unemployed for the entire plane ride to Los Angeles. || My friend taught me this one. You take the heel of your hand, you can shove someone's nose right through their brain. I can't even watch someone blow their nose. If I'm in a fight, I'm not gonna be shoving or poking, I'm gonna be running or begging - that's my two choices, right there. || Republicans are just rich, old, white people - that's all they are. You ever see the Republican National Convention? All white people - six black people: paid actors. James Earl Jones in his most difficult, challenging role! Tune in and attempt to watch him look pleased during a George Bush speech. And Clarence Thomas - as himself. || Jewish people, we're repulsed by Hitler, but we're obsessed with him. If you ever want to rob a Jewish person's house, all you have to do is call them up and tell them there's a Hitler film festival down at the multiplex - watch them file out. || You know, civil rights is great and everything, but a lot of people don't realize that plumbers in the South make less money than when they used to install separate drinking fountains. || I noticed when I was driving around that they changed the name of the Interborough Parkway to the Jackie Robinson Parkway. And the Interborough family is very upset about this... || President Obama. He is the man. I’ve tried the rest, and he is the best. My dream is for him to appoint me to be the Secretary of Humor. My first act will be to make whatever Larry the Cable Guy is doing illegal. || Kevin James is going to do a couple of specials. One’s called It’s Getting Muggy In Here. || Jewish people, we don't believe in Hell or a future place to suffer. We're suffering right now. Every one of our holidays celebrates how much we've suffered. Passover - we're celebrating 5,000 years ago, God passed over our houses and murdered all the Egyptians. We're celebrating, 'Hey, thank God we didn't get slaughtered.' || Over in Amsterdam, they spoke pot. They mix it with hash and tobacco and they roll it together. And the reason why they do that: they have so many vices, they have to combine them. “Oh, I’ll smoke pot but I don’t want to have that cut into my cigarette smoking time. I’m doin’ a hooker in 10 minutes.” || My wife and I want to try swapping. We want to go to one of those key parties where you put your keys in a bowl. But we just want to upgrade our car. || I made fun of Adam Sandler so that future generations of comedians could be cast in his movies. I made fun of Jay leno so there could be a Jimmy Fallon. || Tracy Morgan apologizes for his homophobic rant, still no apologies for the sketch about the guy living under the street. || I dated this woman for three weeks, and then she told me that she had a penis. I thought we were just role-playing. It was unbelievable. I was so shocked and embarrassed by it, it took me three more weeks to convince her to start wearing condoms. || George Lopez does so much mugging, I’m surprised he’s not up on charges. || Whenever I watch the beginning of Jimmy Fallon, I feel like I should sue the Roots for bait and switch. || Carrot Top will be doing a show about the history of ancient trunks. Gallagher will be smashing ancient fruit. || I was recently voted best standup never to win a major. || Dave Rath is recovering. A month ago he had hip pocket replacement surgery. || My Jihad energy drink isn’t going to go. Ramadan noodles, not going to go. My Islamic version of the 3 Stooges, with Mohammed and whatever would be the Islamic version of Larry and Curly... || My cat’s fully capable of speaking, but he says he’s afraid of me turning it into a Kevin James vehicle. || George Lopez has to get a physical comedy checkup every year to make sure his bulging eyes don’t get out of control... Good news George... you are humor free! There’s no sign of comedy anywhere in your blood stream. || The saddest day in Pixar history was when some guy said ‘get Larry the Cable Guy on the phone. || Pixar has announced Larry the Cable Guy will be starring in Cars 3 thru 6. Howie Mandel will be playing his sidekick, Mopey the Moped. || How did Dr. Drew become the only psychologist who appears on tv. Did he sign an exclusive with CNN? || I do have insecurities. I don’t know if you can tell. I’m not brimming with confidence. || I get some acting jobs. I like it other than the constant slipping in and out of character. || Why does Louis CK get named Comedy Person of the Year? I should be named Comedy Person of the Year just so I can parlay it into another few weeks of road work. || Judge Judy went to the hospital because she was having intestinal troubles. Turns out, she hates her own guts. || I watched Master Class with Lorne Michaels on OWN. How can somebody produce a sketch show and talk for an hour and not say something even slightly amusing, or sarcastic, or ironic, or interesting, or informative? ‘My mission as a producer is to encourage creativity.’ Mission accomplished. || Some of my inventions didn’t take off. I invented a url lengthener. || Eddie Izzard is doing his show in French... Will he be able to fake ad-lib as well in other languages? He’s been speaking French for a while now, but he’s talking about doing his act in German. Haven’t the German people suffered enough? || I'm sorry and ashamed to report that I'm not actually a Jew. I was pretending to be a Jew to minimize the holocaust. || I don’t think there’s anything Craig Ferguson could say that would make me laugh. Ad-libbing is not the same as entertainment. || Alexander Graham Bell was the first person to ever sarcastically say ""hello"". ""Hellooo, I invented the telephone!"" || You like my shirt? Isn't that nice? $8.50 in a thrift shop. At that price, I can afford not to like it. || I actually wrote a speech. Normally I do bullet points and run-on sentences. || They are telling me there is no way I can fill up an entire room. There must be a constant reminder that I’m not quite able to fill a room. || The motto of my comedy workshop: “If I can’t make you funny, maybe you’re not. Ever think of that?” || Here's a way to break up an astrological love-fest: you just stick your head in the middle of the people and go, 'Uh, you know, Hitler was a Sagittarius.' || Some of my stuff, I realize is just rage. || There’s a lot of controversy online, some people say i’m a genius and other say i’m hugely talented. || I don’t know what Tracy Morgan does on stage, but I can assure you it’s no act. || Comedy Central made their own awards show. They were named best comedy channel. || I have no sympathy for the people who went to Charlie Sheen’s show and were disappointed. ""That didn’t seem very organized! That guy’s all over the map!"" || Milk should be refrigerated even before opening. || I’m still working on my time machine. If I ever perfect it, I’m going back in time to prevent Ace Ventura 2 from being made. And then I’m going after Hitler. || Judah Friedlander, I’m ok with you being the world champion for a few years more. That’s a hook with legs. But I think he should make one more hat, that says ‘there’s a limit to how funny words on a hat can be’. And then move to a chapeau. || Jimmy Buffet was entertaining people at the last shuttle launch... talk about outdated technology. || I don’t like any nastiness on tv unless it’s coming from me. || Maybe Bill Maher should just practice his monologue a few times before the show, so he wouldn’t find it so hilarious. But I kid the asshole. || Jamie Masada is paying for comedians, in lieu of paying them well, he’s paying for them to have therapy at the Laugh Factory. I can just imagine the comedians talking to the therapist ""I dunno, sometimes the audiences here just seem to suck... It is just me, or does the owner here seem crazy?"" || They should also use focus groups only if you’re researching how a cookie tastes. || People are trying so hard to become famous. Johnny Marbles, he tried to throw a pie in Rupert Murdoch’s face. What do I gotta do, give Sumner Redstone a wedgie? || I’m on a show called Wizards of Wavery Place, and I like it, but I’m unable to convince my Tivo that I wouldn’t also like iCarly. || CNN has a thing called You Choose the News. Y’know what CNN? I’m turning you on because I don’t know the news. I was hoping you could help me. || I watched Anderson Cooper 360 for a year before I realized that the second hour was a repeat of the first. I just thought his reporting seemed familiar. || They shouldn’t call anything a boot camp unless you’re going off to war. Standup boot camp has been a fantastic thing, for the people putting it on. They keep you out in the woods and won’t let you come back until you’re funny. Lenny Bruce came up with his Religions Inc. bit on a day hike. || Jewish people, we don't need the money. We're doctors and lawyers. It's the Christians who can't hold a steady job and have to go on TV and ask for money. || Ever since I've switched to the clean syringes, I've never felt better in my entire life. || Next Fall Dr. Drew has a new show coming out: Overdosing with the Stars. || I don’t really know what’s wrong with Jay Leno. I don’t have the training to make a professional diagnosis."
Ant,"My brother hates gay people - hates us. 'We should take all you gays and stick you on an island.' 'Well they have, Frank. We call it Manhattan.' || I'm so gay, I could put a lisp in the word 'cracker.' || I have a wife back in LA who is so pissed at me... yeah, she’s so mad I’m sleeping with her husband. || People are basically good. We all fall. I have so much faith in humanity. That's why God created forgiveness. For those that don't deserve it. You can't spell beautiful without you. || Shine. Do. Become. Repeat. || Miracles happen when fear isn't looking. || Gay people invented sports. Think about it. Boxing. Two topless men... in silk shorts... fighting over a belt and a purse."
Anthony Jeselnik,"My ex-girlfriend have a lot of like really annoying habits, you know I think the worst was she love to read women’s magazines like Cosmo or things like Cosmo and she would flip straight to the relationship quiz, and not only would she present that to me, as if it was like a fun activity for us to do together, even though every question is designed to fuck my entire world. But even worse is she would get mad at my answers and make me change them, so we’d get the best score. || It's impossible for me to hear the words ""quadruple murder suicide"" without thinking of my grandparents. || We just found out my little brother has a peanut allergy, which is very serious I know. But still I feel like my parents are totally overreacting - they caught me eating a tiny little bag of airline peanuts and they kicked me out of his funeral. || Only God can judge wet t-shirt contests. || I spent all night feeding the homeless to dogs. || I used to have sex with my teachers in exchange for good grades on teacher evaluations. || This is embarrassing. My friend accidentally killed himself masturbating when he was just trying to kill himself. || I’ve got a long history of suicide in my family; the good news is it skips a generation, so, if I’m lucky, my kids will kill themselves. || George Zimmerman wants to go to law school. I believe his exact words were, “I’d kill to be a lawyer.” || St. Patrick's Day is what Christmas would be like if Jesus had been killed by a car bomb. || You can't expect everyone to laugh or applaud you for doing edgy things. Sometimes you'll miss. But I think comedians are artists and there's a value in failure. It kind of works both ways between comedians and audiences. The audience has to understand that comedians are going to sometimes tell a joke that doesn't work out with dark subjects, and the comedian has to understand that sometimes they 'll fail and it's not the audience's fault for not getting it or loving it. || My nephew killed himself masturbating but, officially, the cause of death is exhaustion. || Last week, the city of Detroit filed for bankrupty, it became obvious that Detorit was in trouble when it offered to suck chicago’s dick. || I can't talk politics with my cousin because he's such a hypocrite. He's against the death penalty and he hanged himself. || A couple of months ago, I gave my girlfriend some fancy lingerie, and she actually got mad at me. She said, 'Anthony, I think this is more of a gift for you than it is for me.' And I said, 'If you want to get technical, it was originally a gift for my last girlfriend.' || On Twitter, when someone would die, I would write a joke. Or if there's a tragedy, I would write a joke and tweet it. That was my thing, and then at a certain point, people started demanding it. || Babies are the only people I actually trust as far as I can throw them. || I just started a fire in a crowded movie theater. Nobody said shit. || I'm not just offensive, I'm very smart about the way that I do it, and that takes a lot of time. People say that young comics shouldn't be trying these things. That's ridiculous. You should try everything and see what sticks. || I thought I was a father once. But then they did a blood test on the baby and the baby died. || I just took a dump that reminded me of my childhood. Because it was as big as a child. || I'm having trouble convincing my girlfriend to start a fight club. || My ex girlfriend kept stuffed animals all over her bed. It really killed the mood. Because she was a taxidermist. || The best way to break up with a girl is like I'm taking off a band-aid. Slowly and in the shower. || Why don't they put bears in Tampax commercials? || Last year I gave my girlfriend eyeglasses for her birthday. This year I got her Lasik surgery. Because she didn't need the glasses. || If my girlfriend ever turned into a zombie, I would not hesitate to wear a condom. || My girlfriend is pregnant. She asked me if we should have it and I said yes. We should have it cremated. || After a one night stand, make sure you wait two days before you call and tell her she has AIDS. || I would write 100 jokes a day. Most of them were terrible. But I just said, 'I'll write more than everybody else, and that's how I'll get better.' || My girlfriend wants me to choke her while we're having sex. But I say, what's wrong with while we're having dinner? || Everyone makes mistakes. That's why pencils have abortions. || On Thanksgiving, I visit the hospital and deep fry turkeys for the kids in the burn unit, just to see the looks on their ""faces."" || When I was little, I would burn ants with a magnifying glass. But now that I'm older, I'm more of a cat guy. || I've been absolutely furious for no reason lately. Maybe I'll feel better if I find a good psychiatrist and beat him to death. || I don't have a type, really. But I've always been more attracted to girls who yell ""fire."" || I'm not the voice of reason; I'm more the guy using these offensive topics as fodder to raise tension in a joke. || I don't think people shouldn't try to be edgy, but you have to take what the audience says to you in consideration. || I feel worthless. My girlfriend was attacked on the subway yesterday. And I can't even enjoy it. || What do they call that hat Jewish guys always wear? A Yankees cap. || I think my friends wife has been banging a black guy. Because they just had a baby. And the baby had a hole in it. || Why would anyone want to put a mosque at ground zero when we could put a Six Flags at ground zero? || I've got a kid in Africa that I feed, that I clothe, that I school, that I inoculate for 75 cents a day. Which is practically nothing compared to what it cost to send him there. || My neighbor complains every time my girlfriend and I have sex. We're not even that loud. But he used to date my girlfriend. || I wish my family had taken more pictures when I was growing up. Instead of always having to draw everything. || I let a friend set me up on a blind date. It was a disaster. She ended up being a burn victim. By the end of the night. || Ellen Page says that the sexism in Hollywood is constant. You might remember her from her movie Juno, where she played a mouthy chick with no tits. || So glad I'm not the only guy who thinks about killing everyone wearing a hoodie. || No, I did not really punch the woman in the Honeymooners bit. We had a makeup artist punch her. || She got really mad a month ago, because she had e-mailed me a naked picture of herself - which is a nice thing to do - but then I messed up, and I accidentally forwarded that e-mail to both of my parents. Now, my girlfriend is furious, mortified, but I don't even care, 'cause now I have to call up my mother and say 'Mom, I am so sorry - that picture was just for dad.' || Tom Cruise's pre-nup lets him keep his money, the kids and Katie Holmes. || In the second grade, I would just get bored and a joke would pop into my head and I would have to say it. It was almost like I had some brilliant novel in my head that I had to get down, and I would interrupt class all the time and get in trouble. || I never knew if I would get my own show, but I knew I loved stand-up. || Every Thanksgiving, I like to invite the less fortunate over to my place for a great big dinner. And give them the wrong address. || If you drink, don’t drive. Or if you do, at least try to crash into some asshole in a Corvette or something. || Two words no woman should ever have to hear: Triple Mastectomy. || I paid to have sex with a midget once. But I was wasted. And no one told me she was 18. || People in Iceland must be into some pretty freaky shit if they can't find a single virgin to throw into that volcano. || Sure, retarded jokes write themselves. But the spelling is always way off. || Do whatever you want, whenever you want to do it and, as long as you look confident, no one will give you any shit. Put that on the back of a locket, then swallow it. || When I finished high school I wanted to take all my graduation money and buy myself a motorcycle. Buy my mom said no. See, she had a brother who died in a horrible motorcycle accident when he was 18. And I could just have his motorcycle. || Nobody ever went broke telling the American public to fuck themselves. || Yeah we’re not together anymore. She has got - she has got a new boyfriend now. They just moved into together. And I’ve heard rumors that he is abusive, which makes you want to go over there with a baseball bat. And then blame it on her boyfriend. || I think it’s appropriate to start off with a rape joke. It’s good to find out what kind of audience I’m dealing with. || Sure, my uncle killed himself playing Russian Roulette. But I choose to remember him as a great Russian Roulette player. || I like seeing what the comedian thinks is funny, not just what they think I'll think is funny. || Whenever I meet a doctor, I like to pull them aside and say, ""You're a doctor, right? Can you get me some... AIDS medicine?"" || The opposite of sad is down's syndrome. || What kind of super hero would you become if, at age 9, you saw both your parents get raped to death by lambs? Not the cool kind. || Jeff Ross has been roasting people since Whitney Cummings was nothing but a glint in the eye of the man who raped her mother. || I'm an amateur photographer. Never taken anything I'm proud of. Just children having sex. || My roommate in LA used to punch his girlfriend in the stomach. I could never believe what a bitch she was. || Hitler also once tried a juice cleanse. || When I was born, I was my parents favorite. But then they seemed to forgot all about me, once they adopted that stupid highway. || My girlfriend is Jewish. But it's easier to buy her a Christmas present and then break it into 8 pieces. || I'm actually a really nice guy, once you get to blow me. || My mom's been having a hard time lately. She just found out that she has to have both of her breasts removed - if she's ever going to be good at golf. || The driving force behind doing everything that I've been doing for 11 years as a stand-up is having problems with authority and not liking to be told what to do. || That's the worst way you can hear about comedy material: from a third person's blog story that they wrote when they were upset. || Everyone has the same kind of fears; everyone has the same big problems in the world, which is, like, fear of death and 'I hope horrible things don't happen to my family,' but they do. And I think people laugh at them as this great release. || Every night, my girlfriend comes home from work, and she brings with her a houseplant. She’s like, ‘Anthony, I had to pick this up. We need a houseplant in our apartment.’ And every night, I make her return it. I say, ‘No way, baby. You can’t take care of a houseplant. You couldn’t even keep your baby alive.’ || If you suspect your baby may be a problem drinker, please call my cell phone because he sounds fun to hang out with. || Whenever I meet a pretty girl, the first thing I look for is intelligence; because if she doesn’t have that, then she’s mine. || I can drink like a fish, or at least, someone born with fetal alcohol syndrome. || Larry King is so old, he's actually one of the Jews that killed Christ. || I’ve spent the past two years looking for my ex-girlfriend’s killer... but no one will do it. || Larry King's been married eight times. Eight times! Jesus, man. You've got 99 problems and bitches are all of them! || I can tell you what the #4 thing I can’t talk about is. It’s the #4 thing. || I only watch the Oscars to make fun of what they wear in the Memoriam. || I think my friend Jeff is gay. I don't know - I'm so bad with names. || A well-known Huston stripper reportedly twerked so hard that she suffered a miscarriage on stage… Not the punchline. Because in her defense, she did tell everybody, ‘I don’t think you’re ready for this jelly’. || Childhood obesity affects all pedophiles. || I honestly can't remember the last time I hit myself in the head with a hammer. || I would never hit a woman - even if she had a knife or a stutter. || I will never understand how a mother can kill her own baby and not get away with it. || I feel like every first episode of a TV show is bad, you know, and it always improves. || I'm not a religious person; I would call myself an atheist. I don't have a good story behind it, I'm just reasonable. || I'm not a big porn guy. I just like to jerk off to whatever's on Cinemax at two o'clock in the afternoon. || People who get offended by jokes are fucking stupid. || Did you know that diarrhea can actually kill you? Even if you only drink a little bit. || I've decided to take my grandmother off of life support. As soon as she gets sick. || My dad was a complicated man. He was a huge racist, my dad, but he still tried to be a good father, you know? Like, he would tell me that Santa Claus was black - that way, when I found out he didn't exist, it wouldn't be that big a let down. || Broke up with my last girlfriend because she lied to me and told me she got molested by her neighbor. But I know her neighbor. He’s a really cool guy. Not like her creepy ass other neighbor. || My girlfriend was just killed in a car accident. Devastating. I can't believe I'm only going to have sex with her one more time. || I was in Boston a couple years ago, and a very drunk girl - they’re always very drunk - ran up to me. And she screams out, ‘You should never make fun of the Holocaust!’ And I said, ‘Why?’ You know, just to be a dick. And she says, ‘Because I lost family in the Holocaust’. And I said, ‘You don’t look Jewish’. And she said, ‘Listen, asshole, There are certain lines you’re not supposed to cross, certain boundaries you’re never supposed to push’. And I said, ‘Hey, hey, hey. I just gave you a compliment’. || I'm writing a book. It's called The Soft Spot... and Other Ways to Stop a Crying Baby. || Racist dermatologists think all black people have really bad skin. || About a month ago some kids in my neighborhood were playing hide-and-go-seek and one of them ended up in an abandoned refrigerator. It's all anybody talked about for weeks. I said, 'Who cares? How many kids you know get to die a winner?' || I like my mom's cooking a little better than my girlfriend's. But I don't tell my girlfriend that. I tell my girlfriend her cooking sucks. || I loved Stephen Wright, and I loved Mitch Hedberg, but they seemed like geniuses you could never emulate. You'd just be ripping them off. || I hate when I'm masturbating to a hot chick on TV and then, right when I'm about to come, it cuts to one of the other Smurfs. || I have a twelve year old sex doll. Brand new. || I enjoyed writing for someone else's voice, but I wasn't very good at it. || My friend has been enjoying the craziest sex life since he got a divorce from his sister. || The other night my girlfriend and I are in bed together. She says, 'Anthony, I want you to pee on me.' Now I have never thought about peeing on a woman in my entire life. Never even imagined it before but then I got the green light and apparently, it's my thing. I just jumped up right away. But as soon as that begins she starts screaming at me; like it's my fault she talks in her sleep. || I plan on talking to my kids about sex early. Like six. Or seven am. || I buried my grandmother last year. It was devastating for my grandfather. He's still really mad at me. || Of all the ways people save time, I think racism is the worst. || Most guys don't realize that when they're having sex with their girlfriend, their also having sex with everyone I've had sex with, too. || I don't trust anything that bleeds for five days and has AIDS. || I think a theater show is a pure version of me doing my material. The theater crowd is a bit more polite, there really aren't hecklers, and there are a lot of people there to see me, and they're excited about the jokes and hanging out with me for a show. || If I ever get the chance, I'd like to force a mailman to eat his own mail. || I could see myself adopting a kid someday. But, obviously, I'd prefer it to be aborted. || I'm working on a screenplay about a guy who teaches a retarded kid to read. It's good. But it is so fucking long. || My favorite part of going to a wedding is ruining the wedding. || I like to play pranks on my girlfriend, you know, keep things fresh for me, make me laugh, you know? She hates it. But like, the other night, I put Saran wrap over the toilet seat, you know, which doesn’t sound that original, but she’s bulimic. || I killed a squirrel once with a car. Twice with a tennis racket. || I describe myself to people as a ""history buff."" It just sounds better than ""Holocaust buff."" || I don't know what I'd do if anything ever happened to my girlfriend. But first, I'd probably burn my clothes. || Tragically, my last girlfriend couldn't cook to save her life. || It's always difficult when someone close to you passes away. But it's really tough when they're on top of you. || Hitler really wasn't so bad. In the black way. || My sister just had a baby, a little newborn. The kid is adorable, so cute. She wouldn't let me hold him, she refuses. She says, 'No way, Anthony, I'm afraid you're gonna drop him.' I'm 32 years old. Like I'm some kind of idiot. Like I don't have a million other ways to hurt that baby. || I don't know what to do. I have a friend in Japan. And he actually owes me ten bucks. || Yesterday I accidentally hit a little kid with my car. It wasn't serious - nobody saw me. || My mouth is big enough for me to fit my entire fist in your vagina. || Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day. Give a man AIDS, and you don't have to give him any fish. || Stereotypes wouldn't be so bad if black people were nicer, in general. || If you're getting raped by a fireman, do not yell ""FIRE."" And definitely don't bring up 9/11. || I'm trying to teach my girlfriend how to surf. But I just end up yelling at her the whole time. Because I don't know how to surf. || I'm getting pretty worried. My girlfriend hasn't gotten her period. And she's already 14. || My dad was amazing. He raised five boys. All by himself. Without the rest of us knowing. || I grew up in a poor family. I had to cut everyone's hair, because we didn't have money for entertainment. || If we can teach sign language to monkeys, then shouldn't deaf people be awesome at gymnastics? || The true meaning of Christmas is actually centuries of gullibility. || My neighbor's pit bull just attacked their baby. Their kid is fine. But the baby's dead. || The other day my girlfriend complained to me “chivalry is dead. Oh, Anthony, chivalry is dead.” And I told her “No, baby, chivalry isn’t dead. Chivalry is alive and well. You’re thinking of your mom.” || An offended audience member repeating a comedian's act from memory is worse than, literally, anything. || I’m very arrogant and mean. I’m almost like a bad guy professional wrestler. || My girlfriend makes me want to be a better person - so I can get a better girlfriend. || Whenever I’m about to have sex with a girl, I play it smart and just automatically assume she has herpes; because that way I don’t have to tell her about my herpes. || I want to marry the kind of girl that walks out of an abortion clinic with a lollipop. || I once went on a date with a girl where we went hiking... and she gets bit by a snake in between her toes, andI had to suck out the poison... so she’s dead. || Just got an email from a necrophiliac wishing me dead. Hey, thanks for the compliment! || My mom, for most of her life, was a Holocaust denier. And it was terrible for the entire family to have to deal with until, finally, a couple years ago, we had an intervention. And we had a rabbi come into the home, had him walk her through the history of the Jewish people, and then he made her watch “Schindler’s List."" And after that, my mom did a complete 180. Now she can’t believe it only happened once. || My ex-girlfriend owned a parakeet... Oh my god, that fucking thing would never shut up. But the bird was cool. || Just got back from the dentist. He said I have no cavities! And mouth cancer. || I don't know what possessed me, but yesterday I yelled out the wrong name in the middle of my girlfriend's funeral. || Perhaps I'm being too optimistic, but I think this country is finally ready for a black serial killer. || When I'm sick I don't shake hands. I say hello by putting my fingers in your mouth. || My girlfriend just asked me for ten grand because she wants fake tits. I said no, baby. You need fake tits. || I don't ever want to have kids of my own. But I do want a lot of kids. || This past Christmas, I told my girlfriend for months in advance, 'Baby, all I want from you this year is an Xbox. That's it. Beginning and end of list: Xbox.' You know what she got me? A homemade frame with a picture of us from our first date together. Which was fine - because I got her an Xbox. || I should just keep my mouth shut, but I can’t… because I’m so fucking funny. || Every comic went through their Mitch Hedberg phase - the glasses, the hair in the face - and you knew immediately when they were doing it. || I almost got fired for watching internet porn at work. Instead I got fired for masturbating. || My girlfriend is pregnant. But we've already decided to give it up for abduction. || I don't know about condoms for everyone in porn. But there is a strong case for goggles. || In honor of Veteran's Day, make sure to pinch anybody not wearing green. || Father's Day makes me wish I could talk to my Dad just one more time, instead of all the time. || Child molesters must all think they've got huge dicks. || I'm mad at my roommate for masturbating in front of the computer. It's my computer. And he doesn't even watch anything. || The world is full of horrible things that will eventually get you and everything you care about. Laughter is a universal way to life your head up and say: ‘Not today, you bastards.’ || You don’t know anything about pain until you’ve seen your own baby drowned in a tub... and you definitely don’t know anything about how to wash a baby. || Watching soccer just makes me wish I was watching Foosball. || When I was seven, I broke my leg playing soccer. Just to feel something. || Donald, I'm not sure if you're even aware of this, but the only difference between you and Michael Douglas from the movie, Wall Street, is that no one's going to be sad when you get cancer. || So two women who had been shot were discovered on a golf course. It sounds like someone got a hole in one and a hole on the other one. || Weeks after those tragic fires in Arizona, a fallen firefighter's bracelet that said ""Be Good"" was found in the ashes. Some see it as a sign from God, while others see it as what fire suits should be made out of. || People say it's easy to make fun of retarded people, but it's not. You really have to explain it to them. || My girlfriend loves to eat chocolate. She’s always eating chocolate, and she likes to joke she’s got a chocolate addiction. ""Get me away from those Hersheys bars. I’m addicted to them."" It’s really annoying. So I put her in a car and I drove her downtown. And I pointed out a crack addict. And I said, ""Do you see that, honey?... Why can’t you be that skinny?"" || I was always fascinated by forbidden things people didn’t want to talk about, like death. || Women are like potato chips. They better come with my fucking sandwich. || When my girlfriend cooks dinner, I'm happy to do the dishes. Because I make her wash dishes when I take her to a restaurant. || My girlfriend asked me if I only love her for her body. I said no, baby. Just parts of it. || I'm screwed. My girlfriend just found my massive porno collection. DVDs, magazines and hard drives. All over at her sister's place. || It's tough, but I try to wait until the second date before I bring up my dead girlfriends. || Doctor just told me I can't have kids. I asked for a second opinion. He said, Why? No one's gonna to let you take kids from this hospital. || I hated my mom for not letting me play football as a kid. So when I have kids someday, I guarantee they'll never meet their grandmother. || Disgusting. I just found my grandpa's Viagra. I swear, I almost puked from eating so many. || The first time I had sex, I didn't know what I was doing. It was a relief when the whole thing was over after just 45 minutes. || I prefer to sleep with deaf girls. Those crazy chicks never have a safe word. || My girlfriend is despicable. I just found out she flirted with my brother, during my mom's funeral, while I was asleep. || My friend has a weird relationship with his mother. She breast fed him until he was four. And since then he’s just taken it. || World AIDS Day is the one day of the year that it's okay to totally ignore lesbians. || My great grandmother threw herself in front of a bus. The police tried to say she was committed suicide but the family knew she was just trying to stop civil rights. || Every Sunday my dad calls to ask if I went to church. And every Sunday I lie and say: ""Sorry. Wrong Number."" || My girlfriend has the greatest story as to why she isn’t religious anymore. When she was a kid, like 12 years old, her parents nailed a 25 pound crucifix to the wall right above her bed. About two weeks later, in the middle of the night, the crucifix falls off the wall and leaves a two inch gash in the back of her dad’s head. || I want to get a tattoo of the word ""irony"", only misspelled. || I think about my girlfriend's abortion whenever I pass by a school. Or the playground where she had the abortion. || I had a happy childhood in a nice suburban area, pretty idyllic, upper middle class and very, very white. My dad is an attorney. My mother is a housewife. They had five kids in seven years: me, my brother, and three sisters. I’m the oldest. We were all very active. My mother was exhausted. || North Korea pissed off the entire world last week by testing yet another nuclear bomb. This brings North Korea one step closer to a full scale nuclear bomb, that we will drop on North Korea. || Valentine's Day was created by the greeting card industry to get pussy. || My little sister tried to run away from home once. But, just a few hours later, somebody found the body. || I would love to DJ the royal wedding. Just so I could play ""Candle in the Wind"" non-stop. || I was raised Catholic. I rejected it later on. I’m an outspoken atheist now. People say, ‘Oh, it’s a negative thing to be an atheist.’ I don’t agree. I think it’s more optimistic to think that there is no God, no afterlife. || Like I’ll never forget the last time, we played that game, she was like Anthony. If you could have lunch with anyone in the world living or dead who would it be. And I said I don’t know, Caligula and she was really Caligula, that’s your answer, that’s what you’re going to say to me your girlfriend: are you sure, I said I am sorry baby, let me change that, I’d have lunch with you and you’d be dead. || My girlfriend wants an open relationship. I said no way. What kind of man would I be if I had to tell my friends I date you? || Women are really divided on abortion in this country. Half of them are cool, but the other half I have to drag down there. || When I die, I want to be cremated with everybody. || Halloween is just a made up holiday, created by the razor blade industry. || I had written for Jimmy Kimmel and Sarah Silverman in the past. Jimmy had a different voice, and different priorities. He couldn't be the bad guy in the joke; he couldn't upset people, really. || My sister is going to have a simple wedding. Just immediate family. And whoever the hell would want to marry her. || Look at this dais... you've got a pimp, a murderer, a drug dealer, a pornographer... and then eight white people. || I got an email from my ex, telling me that she has AIDS. I didn't know how to comfort her, so I just wrote back ""I know."" || A new survey shows that married women are having 40 percent more extramarital sex than 20 years ago. Scientists say that number drops significantly when they subtract your mom. || You'll get my assault weapon when you pry it out of my curious six-year-old's cold dead hands. || You’re so fucking stupid, you dropped out of school faster than Casey Anthony’s kid. || Who do you think was better: Jesus or Buddha; I mean, just in terms of not letting themselves get crucified? || Maybe the most uncomfortable moment of my life was when my dad gave me the sex talk. The old man was into some really crazy shit. || I had a friend whose gotten so many DUIs that he had to go to jail for a year. Now, his only concern was getting raped. For the entire year, he didn't take a shower. || My dad's been having a hard time lately. Keeps on losing his keys. Can't hang on to a set of keys to save his life. And he has tried everything too: little hook next to the door, little bowl next to his bed, keychain makes a noise when you whistle. Nothing worked. So finally, this year for his birthday, the whole family chipped in - and we put him in a home."
Aries Spears,"I’m at a very frustrating point in my career because I’m not a millionaire. Like, people assume because you’re in movies or TV, you’re rich. I’m not rich, but I’m far from broke. I’m what you call a ‘thousandaire.’ || That's where the money is, on the road. || I know when the anthrax thing hit - white people, y'all was very nervous. Y'all would come up to me at work and warn me, like 'Oh my God, Aries, be careful. Don't open your mail.' Let me tell you something - black folks was never worried about anthrax because, half the time, we don't open our mail no way. We might think that's a bill. We might hold it to the light and go, 'That's a red slip.' If you want to get us with anthrax, put that in a Jay-Z CD. That's how you get us. || There's got to be structure and great comedy. When you start with that, everything else falls into place. || The average comedian is kind of an observer looking at everyday things that everyone could relate to and then trying to find the exaggeration in those things. || We are all a little bit racist. White people, y’all are the first people to denounce it. ""I’m not racist. I’m incapable of being racist. My best friend is black... He’s also my chauffeur, but he’s my best friend."" || I think Chappelle set the bar when he came out with his show. To be as great as him or greater you have to push it a little further - as long as there's substance in terms of the material. || I always said if I ever get married, I would tell my woman - I love Michael Jordan, I am a Michael Jordan fanatic - I said, 'Michael Jordan is the only athlete you can sleep with and I wouldn't get mad, as long as you got something signed. You gotta bring back a ball, a hat or something. You can't just give away that shit for free.' || Ladies Commit, There’s A Wedding In It For You. || I like to go to the frat house and drink with my white friends, because anytime you go drinking at the frat house, white boys bring you a drink and hand it to you like it's a top CIA secret. They'll hand me my drink, and I'll go, 'Man, what the hell is in this?' 'Dude, don't worry. Don't ask, just drink it. I'll see you in 20 minutes.' Next thing you know, I'm buck naked, standing on a coffee table, with a cowboy hat. || Fellas, you have to stop letting women put all this pressure on us. Talking about, ""I didn’t come"". ""Bitch, I did. What’s wrong with your shit?"" I tell a woman before we even get started, ""Look, team bus leaves in two minutes and eight seconds. I’ma scream your name twice and I’ma scratch you off the clipboard. You better hurry the fuck up."" || Eddie Murphy was the Michael Jordan of comedy. He had a full range of abilities. || How do you ask a woman to gargle your nuts? || To sustain longevity, you have to evolve. || My momma used to kick in the door like SWAT! || I'm from the streets of New York. I know what tough talk sounds like. || Because it's uncensored cable, I think we'll be able to do the kind of sketch comedy that really hasn't been seen before. We can actually finish jokes. || I never wanted to limit myself to just impressions. I wanted to branch out and develop other parts of my game. || The best part about being a stand-up is the connection with the audience. There's nothing more gratifying then when you can make 300 people applaud and stand up - because that's all you. || Obama had all the right ingredients that came together at the right time. He’s tall, good-looking, articulate, highly intelligent, smooth under pressure, charismatic. And most importantly, the right shade. He made white people feel comfortable. Because y’all know if that nigga was Bernie Mac black or precious purple, he wouldn’t have won. He’s like coffee with cream, it goes down easy."
Arj Barker,"I could've enjoyed a cigarette if I smoked back before everyone knew it was bad - say, like, 1923. Everybody smoked back then. There was no medical information against it; they had no idea - it was a paradise. It was a smoker's paradise: 'They're taking my lung out next week. I don't know why. Doctor thinks maybe I'm brushing my teeth too often, but I can't help it because, for some reason, my breath smells like I licked a monkey's ass.' || I was in a real conservative area just outside of Chicago recently. And this guy's like, 'Hey, Arj, you're from San Francisco. Are you in favor of gay marriage?' I was like, 'Well, I'd like to get to know you a little bit better first. I don't know what ever happened to buying a guy a smoothie and seeing what happens. That's how we do it back home.' || Nobody can ever learn our military's secrets - unless, you know, they happen to have the Discovery Channel. Then, it's pretty easy, just tune in for a few minutes. || Can you imagine if you had a pair of shoes that you could only walk in? That could be kind of limiting under certain circumstances. 'Everybody get outta here! There's a swarm of bees coming!' What? Oh great, I got my walking shoes on today. I guess I better stroll the hell out of here at a moderate pace. || For years and years, Arj Barker was high on life, but eventually, I built up a tolerance. || A woman is a highly developed, deeply intelligent, infinitely complicated being. And it needs to be carefully tricked into doing things. || I'm thinking of switching banks, and my friend said, 'Well, what's wrong with Citibank?' Well, they can't spell 'city.' I hope their math is better than their English is. || I just got a car, and I gotta say, this car is very cryptic. The very first day I drove it, a light came on out of nowhere: 'Check engine.' Could they be any more vague? What if a light came on and said, 'Problem'? || She picked me up in her car because I was traveling by bus, and I thought it would be a lot easier for her to pick me up in her car than for me to convince Greyhound to reroute the bus to go by her house. The paperwork alone - logistical nightmare. || I was troubled by the presence of a shoe museum because it forced me to ask a very burning question: would my body be able to physically survive the amount of dope I would need to smoke in order to visit a shoeseum? || I'm coming back. And when I get back, then we'll be together forever - forever and ever and ever - until death. Even beyond - beyond death: two souls enmesh as one soul! One soul floating for all of eternity in the great abyss, the aftermath, that which remains unknown to all who dwell in the trappings of mortal flesh, until the final passing!' Anyway, that's what I left on her answering machine. She hasn't called back yet. || All I knew about Ireland before I went there was what I learned from watching soap commercials all my life. I was totally misinformed. I thought it was an Irish tradition where you don't even take a shower with your soap - you take your soap for a walk, you compliment the soap for a little while and then, suddenly, you just start hacking it up with a hunting knife.  || There are so many types of shoes. There's so many categories, and I really have no idea what type of shoe I need at any given time. And I go in there - I find it a little bit overwhelming. 'Welcome to the shoe store! What are you looking for? Are you looking for walking shoes?' Well, uh, I'd like to have that option. Hopefully, they're adjustable. I mean, I'd like to be able to turn them up to other settings, as well. || You don't just get a computer to get online. You gotta get other stuff. You better get a modem, or you're not getting on anything. You gotta get a monitor, that's what I found out. You gotta get a mouse. You gotta get a mouse pad. You gotta get a sperm guard for your keyboard. || You know the little camel on the pack of cigarettes? They just found out that's not even a camel. It's actually a horse with a big, old tumor growing out of its mouth. || I never thought I'd be a comedian. But, growing up, I simply loved watching comedy. The '80s was huge for comedy in the US. Eddie Murphy blew me away with his film Delirious. || My friend and I were up to all sorts of shenanigans at school. But one time it ended up disrupting the whole class and we got in trouble. His parents told him he wasn't allowed to hang out with me any more. I had a friendship break-up in third grade. It was brutal. || Just open your heart man and accept that people are gay. Thousands, probably millions of people are gay. And until we find a cure - we will practice unconditional love and tolerance towards these people. And we will let them get married because they're easier to track that way. || There’s too much porn on the internet. That’s why I’m downloading all of it. || I found a grey hair in my beard the other day, and that can mean one of two things. I'm either getting old or I'm a fucking wizard! || My friends, they only want to know one thing: 'Did you score? Did you score? Did you score? Did you score?' Hey, guess what - news flash, guys - a date's not a sporting event. A date's an opportunity to be in the presence of another individual and celebrate the unique-osity of that person. And no - I didn't fucking score! || She said I was moving too fast... I think it was a nice gesture to give her flowers on the first date. Perhaps the 'Bless This Family' plaque could have waited. || I never smoke grass and drive my car because, for one thing, no matter how many letters I write to the road commissions, they still refuse to start designing highways with second-chance exits. || Home is wherever I am. People make too big a deal about where you live. I try to be grounded in myself. Home is another way of saying 'a place where you keep all your stuff'. || I quit because I'm so tired of hearing bad news about cigarettes... Even if they discover good news, they don't publicize it - like the fact that smoking seriously reduces the risk of jogging. || Is it weird being a twin city? Do you sometimes know exactly what the other city's thinking? || I read this on the Internet - did you know that 4th of July is more popular in this country than in any other country in the whole world? || I hate all generalisations. || I was a typical kid. I dug holes in the yard, threw rocks, had plum battles with the neighbours and used trash can lids as shields. I was always outside getting dirty. || From an early age, I was trying to get laughs, but it wasn't a conscious thing. I think I was about six months old when I first realized I needed friends in life and making people laugh worked for me. By nine months, I came out of my shell. || I deserve someone who likes me for who I am pretending to be. || Anybody see 'Cop Land'? I went to go see it, but I got stoned in the parking lot. And then on the way in, I read the marquee, and I got paranoid and went home. || There's no razor in candy. If for no other reason, it doesn't make financial sense. It's not fiscally prudent. How much does a piece of candy cost - like, a penny and a half? An apple's like 15 cents? Anybody here bought a Mach 3 replacement cartridge recently? They're so expensive, they don't even keep them on the shelf. You know, you have to ask the people behind the counter. I feel like I'm trying to buy enriched plutonium or something. || Google is ridiculous. Everyone uses Google, and that's why Google has such an attitude. Because it's so popular, it's conceited. I mean, it has a serious attitude. Have you tried misspelling something lately? See the tone that it takes? 'Um, did you mean...?' || You're finally old enough to go trick or treating by yourself, and then they gotta give you that talk. 'Alright, son, just go door to door and get the candy, that's all you gotta do. Just go get the candy. Knock on the door, go to the next house, get more candy, and it's all yours. Get to keep it all. Have fun, get lots of candy. Oh yeah, one more thing I forgot to tell you, son - be careful 'cause the candy might have razor blades in it.' Oh my God, what a horrible thing to tell an 18-year-old... || I know that most domesticated animals aren't indigenous to this country. So guess what, cat? You can beat it. Go back to Catalina Island or Catalonia, Spain, or Katmandu, or wherever the hell your hairy ass is from! 'Cause this is America and around here - Katmandon't. || I'm in love with a philosophy major, and she doesn't even know I exist. And what's worse, she can prove it. || I just got a new iPod. It’s got 80 gigabytes. Because I like to jog for three weeks at a time and I do not want to hear the same song twice. || The last time I smoked pot and drove a car I ended up getting pulled over by a street cleaner. Marijuana has been scientifically proven to distort one’s perception of depth and distance. So driving’s a terrible idea. 'Cuz you’re in your car, like, ""Oh man, I got a small steering wheel. Well, I am a magical gnome.. so that’s pretty cool."" ""Maybe I’ll pull over by that pine tree and take a hike... oh wait, shit, that’s the air freshener!"" || I couldn't get away with Halloween pranks 'cause my parents owned the health food store. So, it was so easy to bust me. I was the only kid on the block egging houses with those big 'ole brown eggs. Like, you didn't have to be a detective to figure it out. 'Oh, I wonder who Tofuttied my mailbox. Is it the same evil genius who filled my bird bath with Rice Dream?' || My general rule of thumb is, once something's a ride at Disneyland, I assume that it is no longer a threat in real life. Which is why I don't expect to get attacked by a giant tea cup anytime soon. || I believe that if you go on a date and get to second base and then you go home alone and rub one out, that’s like runs batted in. || It’s gotten to the point where I think my friends would rather hang out with their own kids than hang out with me. And I’m like, ""Alright, but where’s the loyalty, man. I’ve known you for twenty-five years. How long have you known your baby, like, a month?"" || I fainted last night! Luckily I was going to bed at the time so I didn't get hurt. || The other day I saw a guy with a sign that said, ""where will you spend eternity?"". Which freaked me out because I was on my way to the Department of Motor Vehicles. || You can get tested now for early onset Alzheimer's. Hold on a second, could someone hire a marching band, cause I'm so happy I feel like having a parade. You mean I can find out early if I'm going to die of a super horrible disease that there's no cure for? Well, whoopee! || I love New York, though I'll never eat any of the ice creams that they sell in the park. That's just disgusting. You see the little picture of them? They all have a little bite taken out of them already. || I’m trying to feel terrified and alone. And regret every decision I’ve ever made, drenched in a cold sweat. It’s called going to sleep. Maybe you’ve heard of it. || I had to buy a new printer the other day. The printer I wanted was like $200, but for some reason, I figured out that if I bought a printer/copier/scanner/faxer/coffee maker/clay oven/tennis racquet restringer, it's like $8.95. And I had to ask myself: why would it be that by paying less, I get more? How is it that the less I pay, the more I get? And I've figured out there's only one logical answer - the giant, multinational, megacorporations really just want me to be happy. That's the only possible answer. || I’m not even worried about settling down. I think it’s way too early. I’m 25 and I’m in show business. I mean, if things go well, my wife hasn’t even been born yet. || Now I have a fax machine. I never had one before, and I might have to admit, I'm excited to use it. But the problem is, I don't really have anything to fax. I mean, take a good look at me. Do I look like I have any documents that need to be somewhere in a hurry? || I think its time to go to a library and face the facts. || It’s too difficult to convey tone in electronic communication. And we can solve this my friends. All we need is some new fonts. ""'Great party Arj. Best party ever.' What a jerk!"" ""How do you know he wasn’t being sincere, Arj?"" ""Because he wrote it in Sarcastica! If he had enjoyed himself, he would have used Good Times Roman."" || They got a restaurant called Hungry Jack's, but I didn't feel comfortable eating there. How good could it be? The guy who owns the restaurant is hungry. If it was called Fat Happy Fucking Well-Contented Jack's, I'd eat there. But I wouldn't bring a kid because it has a swear word in the title, and that's inappropriate."
Artie Lange,"By the time I am Howard's age I hope to be long retired. I don't plan on working that long. || When you're on that ecstasy shit, this sounds like ""Hey Jude"". || I want to see Toby Maguire fight Christian Bale. || I found a way for her to fall asleep, Paris Hilton, talk to herself. || If I get lucky enough one day to have Howard`s money and life... Actually, you know what, if I ever get Howard money I am going to retire. || You're so stupid... Yet your live. || I have gay friends, I support gay rights, I have nothing against the gay community, but when I see two guys kissing, I think it's gross. And, by the way, it's gross when 99% of straight people do it, too. || Everytime I go to Vegas, I seem to incur some kind of fine. || The Howard Stern Show is a big hit because it entertains dumb and smart people at the same time for different reasons. There's a couple of shows like that, The Simpsons is another one, smart people and stupid people love The Simpsons for totally different reasons; that's why it's a big hit, everybody's either smart or stupid so a lot of people watch it. Our show, smart people and stupid people love it for different reasons and early on in my career I made a commitment to myself; I refuse to cater to stupid people. What we do on the air is just try to be funny and hope that the smart people listen more than the dumb people. || I wish I was this dark genius artist - like Richard Pryor or something. There's that story about how Eric Clapton saw Jimi Hendrix play, and he supposedly went home and cried because he could never be that good. I would never do anything that fruity, but I can relate to that. I wish I was as great as other guys, and that sucks. So I get the blues, and I self-medicate. || Well I have a drug history and a public drinking problem and I am not the healthiest guy. So they just ran that I died of a drug overdose. || I had a career before the Stern show, on Mad TV. I was on the first two seasons of that and I got kicked off it because of possession of cocaine. || If you are a black woman, you get two history months in a row. || But I live an interesting life and I can tell a pretty good story and it has helped my career. But the downside is people know everything. || I did drugs wrong. I’m the only guy who ever got fat on cocaine. I went to rehab for coke, and a black guy came up to me and said, ""Damn, man, what are you pouring that shit on, cheeseburgers?"" || A-Rod wants to be like Babe Ruth. And people don’t realize this, he’s a lot like Babe Ruth. Before the playoffs a couple of years ago, A-Rod went to the hospital and promised a dying kid he’d ground out to second for him. || I've never been swimming, and that's because it's never been more than half an hour since I last ate. || For a degenerate like me, Vegas is like a walk down memory lane. Last time I went to Vegas, I went to my old coke dealer’s kid’s bar mitzvah. || I was in five movies that got a total of four stars from The Daily News. And the reviews of ""Beer League"" were nothing compared to ""Dirty Work."" The review in my home town paper, The Star Ledger, said that I ""had all the charm of a date rapist."" I felt really bad about that, then Norm MacDonald; he's trying to cheer me up, being totally serious; says ""well, a date rapist has to have way more charm than a regular rapist!"" || Women will do anything Oprah Winfrey says, and that is why we can't have women voting. || A weekend in Vegas without gambling and drinking is just like being a born-again Christian. || I was at Yankee Stadium one time at 5 a.m., but that was to buy angel dust. || Vegas means comedy, tragedy, happiness and sadness all at the same time. || Of course in show business there are two ways to play it and I am not politically correct so I am not going to get endorsements or anything like that. || If Mike Tyson was the voice of your GPS, would you ever not use it? || In Hollywood, there is another name for a woman's 40th birthday party, it's a retirement party. || My mother would say, before I left the house, 'Remember Art, hugs are better than drugs.' And I believed my mother, I believed everything she said - until the first time I got high at a party. I leaned back, and I went, 'God, this is way better than when my Uncle Perry hugs me. What else has my mother been lying to me about?' || I'm 30 sit-ups away from the body of a young Mark Hamill. || Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. || Howard's unbelievably nutty, politically incorrect style is probably the single biggest influence on me. || I had a job that people in this business would absolutely kill for on the sitcom I was on, I was working with one of my best friends. Laurie Metcalf was in the cast, really talented people on the Warner Brothers lot in LA. I was a supporting character making 35 grand a week, some weeks I'd have two lines. I had a job making 35 grand a week where I didn't have to take anything to work; I didn't have a briefcase or a piece of paper. I had ridiculously lame, easy jokes to memorize; like the jokes on that show would be I'd go to Norm MacDonald and say 'Are you thinking what I'm thinking?' and he'd say 'No, I'm not thinking of cheeseburgers,' then I'd make a face like 'oh, you got me' and then I'd walk out and then I'd get 35 grand on a Friday. So I had a convertible Mercedes, I was living in a four-thousand dollar a month condo on Willshire and Beverly Hills, I was healthy, I was thin, I had a tan. Even with that life, creatively I was empty inside, I couldn't stand it, after two years I had to get out of there, I was going crazy pulling the hairs out of my head. || I snorted heroin once by accident. It was amazing. But kids, don't snort heroin. It's too good. || When I black out, it's the happiest time of my life. || I have been in a lot of movies, but none of them are critics' darlings, you might say. || Don't do drugs to be cool, do 'em because you hate yourself. || I am not the easiest guy to live with. It is probably the lack of stability in my life. || Have you ever Googled yourself? I did, most depressing thing ever. People have websites hoping I die at 38. || Artie is going to do what ever Artie wants to do. || Crystal meth's a good drug if you need to walk to St. Louis one weekend. || It's a life of five-card draw, and you know what? When God asked me - I'm fine with the card I got. I'm gonna play this. || The point of drinking in moderation is that sometimes you don't drink in moderation. || Whiskey will always be a part of my life. || I once dealt with a prima donna on a movie set. I won't say who, but his first name is a country. A communist country. Run by Fidel Castro. || When I got on Stern I realized that this was the one job where you could be really honest and open, almost like Richard Pryor or something. You can be honest about your life and get laughs. || Frank Sebastiano is a real write. He has two Emmys, one from 'SNL' and the other from 'The Chris Rock Show' . The only award I have is an FM-mmy. || The regular guy still relates to him and Howard is a $500 million guy now who dates a model and drives about in a limo all day. But Howard still knows how to make a plumber laugh and those guys still have him on in the morning, because he is a real talent. || Hugs are great, but - better than drugs? Come on. Let me put it to you this way: I never drove to Harlem at 4 a.m. to get somebody to hug me. || Don't let Karen touch the sauce! || Jason Alexander is a committed actor, he went from working on a show about nothing to actually doing nothing. || I've let chicks think I'm another celebrity just to get laid, just to get any sex. I wish I had a dime for every time in the '90s a chick left New York City thinking she fucked Newman from ""Seinfeld"". || I have a bad gambling problem. You're not in show business for 12 years and dress like this without a bad gambling problem. || I'm not going to lie to you fellas, I've been drinking. || The only reason I can't recommend heroin to kids is because the effects wear off. || And now it looks like I'm probably going to shoot a movie that I wrote. I got the money to do it, and I would star and all, because of being on Howard. || You know how screwed up censorship is, two girls just agreed to make out naked in front of their fathers, and we went ""wait, don't curse"". || I quit drinking, and I figure if I go to ten Yankee games this year without drinking I'll save $32,000. || When I was a kid, I was into The New York Jets. And then I got into girls as I got older, and then I got back into the Jets because I'd realized there's times when the girl won't fuck you, but the Jets will always fuck you. || It is funny because the guy who is my boss now, Howard Stern, has a similarity there. He got big being a regular guy. He wasn't the greatest looking guy in the world."
Aziz Ansari,"No, I don’t text her, ""It was nice meeting you"". I wait eight weeks and I text her, ""What’s cracking?"" || The four sweetest words in the English language - ""You wore me down"". || Yes, I’m married. But my wife understands that a good politician has to be appealing to the ladies. The fact that I haven’t even gotten close to cheating on her is a disappointment to us both. || My perfect date night: I pick you up. In my Kia Sorrento. You get in. There's candles in the car. You go 'Is that dangerous?"" and I go, Yes... but I like danger. We go to your favorite restaurant, and we have a fantastic meal. We come outside and we see my cars on fire. You go, ""Aziz, your cars on fire. Aren't you upset?"" I pull out a bag of marshmallows and I go, No. I knew this was gonna happen. And then I kiss you. In front of my burning car. || What if I couldn’t read? I wouldn’t be able to text my friends movie times or even order cheese biscuits from Red Lobster! || Whats the worst that could happen?! The worst that could happen is he could cut off your legs and use them to make stilts that look like legs! || When I walk around, sometimes people recognize me from things they've seen me in, TV or whatever. And they'd say, you know, stuff, and a lot of times, I wouldn't hear what they'd said because I had headphones on. So, I kinda just go, 'Cool, man. Glad you like the show.' And I'd just keep walking. And this one guy said something to me one time, and I went, 'Cool, man. Glad you like the show.' And then right when I walked past him, I realized, 'Oh, man, that guy didn't say anything about the show.' He went, 'Hey, man, your fly's down.' And I went, 'Cool, man. Glad you like the show. Glad you like seeing my dick pop out of my pants. Come back next week, you can see one of my balls.' || It’s like I’m not even camping. This is actually a dog couch, but it’s super comfortable. || I’m like an elephant, OK? If I walk into a room, it’s like, OK, he’s in there. || Oh yeah he thinks he’s possessed by Scar, the evil lion from lion king, because that happens! || Everyday I start by hitting up Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram. Sometimes, I like to throw in LinkedIn, for the professional shawties. Then I like to go on Reddit. Reddit is great because it has all the important links. Wikipedia! Mankind’s greatest invention. You can learn about anything. Take Ray J for example. We all know he’s a singer, he’s Brandy’s brother, and he was in that classic sex tape with Kim Kardashian. But did you also know he’s Snoop Dog’s cousin and he was in the 96th Tim Burton movie Mars Attacks?! Suddenly, you’re on the Mars Attacks page. I love gChat, you can talk to anybody! I hit up brad.pitt. It wasn’t the actor. It was actually a guy named Brad that’s a teacher in Pittsburgh. We don’t have a lot in common, but we chat quite a bit. Emojis are little cartoons you text instead of words. Instead of saying, ‘What up, boo?’ you can type ‘What up’ and then a cute little ghost because that means boo. There’s even a little Indian guy, but he has a turban on, which I think is racist. But the Asian guy also has a racist hat on. And it’s like, hold up didn’t Japanese people invent this?! Podcasts! They’re a million of them and they’re all amazing! Jean Ralphio and I have one called Nacho Average Podcast where we rate different kinds of nachos. || I'm not making this up - he goes 'Now if your neighbor marries a box turtle, that doesn't affect your everyday life. But that doesn't mean it's right.' I think it's pretty safe to assume that, at one point or another, Senator John Cornyn has thought about making love to a box turtle. I'm sorry, but that's not the first animal you jump to when you're writing that analogy. || I heard this guy going around talking about how he was this big rap producer, and he was just going around and boasting and bragging. And in one of those bragging sessions, I heard him just tell somebody, 'Hey, hey - why don't you try making four beats a day for two summers?' What a dangerously specific challenge that is. || I think you sound like an angel, and everyone else sounds like demons. || This is one of my favorite pick up strategies: I'm constantly giving women my keys. So far, none of them have shown up. Matter of time. And I've been robbed twice. || She broke up with me. Didn’t really tell me why. Luckily when you’re the guy, you can just tell people she’s crazy. ‘Hey, Tom, I heard you and Lucy broke up.’ ‘Yeah, man. Turns out, she’s crazy.’ That’s what they always do on Entourage. || When I’m dating someone, I have a list called my ‘Oh No Nos.’ If a woman commits a Oh No No, it can end the relationship. Not loving ‘90s R&B music is #3 on the Oh No Nos list. Girl don’t even know who Ginuwine is. || Your favorite kind of cake can’t be birthday cake, that’s like saying your favorite kind of cereal is breakfast cereal. || One of the big things I miss about New York is not my friends so much; it's Shake Shack, the burger place. I miss Shake Shack. || Make-A-Baby Tuxedo clothing line. A department store with a guest list. White fur earmuffs for men. Contact lenses that display text messages. Invent a phone that smells good. Own a nightclub, call it Eclipse, that’s only open for one hour two times a year. Cover charge? Five thousand dollars. || She's never seen a single Paul Walker movie? That's a huge Oh-No-No! She also doesn't care about Blu-ray?! || I have no interest in art. Let me clarify - I have no interest in non-nude images. || Most people would say ‘the deets’, but I say ‘the tails’. Just another example of innovation. || My father's cock went into my mother's cunt in the backroom of a Cinnabon. That's how I was born. || Nela - can you come and disinfect this please. I don't want our customers complaining that our fruit tastes like New Zealanders. || I want to take that cheese and do terrible things to it. || I like living in L.A. One thing I don't like about living here is driving. I always get bored when I'm driving, and when I get bored, I go on the Internet on my Blackberry. So I'm gonna die! And whenever they go through the wreckage, they'll find my phone and be like, whoa, that's what he looked up right before he died? Gonna be so sad. It'll be like: Comedian Aziz Ansari was killed in a car accident today. He was struck by another vehicle while using IMDb to see if Val Kilmer was, indeed, in the film ""Willow."" A representative for Mr. Kilmer confirmed he was, indeed, in the film and hopes this will prevent future tragedies of this nature. This is the third ""Willow""-related death this year. || When I tour, it's like, well, like a food tour as much as a comedy tour. I try to eat at all the weird places, the obscure barbecue joints, burger places. There are a few spots in L.A. that I'm obsessed with - one of them is the Taco Zone taco truck on Alvarado. There are secret off-menu items that are amazing. || I was 18 when I started. I was hanging out with some friends and they asked if I had tried stand-up before. I hadn't, but I thought: 'What the hell?' So I went to an open mic night, and I liked it. || For the majority of the time, I may as well have been just a really tan white kid. You know, I may as well have just been, like, a fat kid. || Do It Under the Influence Yourself! That's what we're shooting for! Get drunk and make your dreams come true. || I have a couple of ‘doing caps’ in my wallet. That’s what I call condoms. || Dress code: Black tie optional. Just like life. || Texting With Girls Dangerously Delicious Preview. I’ll text a girl, she text me back right away, I text her back right away, she text me back right away, I text her back right away, she text me back right away, I text her back right away, she text me back right away. Then I’ll say something like: “alright cool, you wanna get pizza on Tuesday?” And I don’t hear anything. || I went to a place recently I think is one of the most fucked up places I've ever been to. I'm convinced this place is the epitome of American excess, of American greed. I'm talking about a place called Cold Stone Creamery. Whoa. If you have not been there, the basic gist of Cold Stone is that they take ice cream and then they just go ape shit with it. || I'm in a situation with this girl that's as hopeless as overthrowing the Bush administration. || Zerts’ are what I call desserts. ‘Trée-trées’ are entrées. I call sandwiches ‘sammies,’ ‘sandoozles,’ or ‘Adam Sandlers.’ Air conditioners are ‘cool blasterz’ with a ‘z’ - I don’t know where that came from. I call cakes ‘big ol’ cookies.’ I call noodles ‘long-ass rice.’ Fried chicken is ‘fry-fry chicky-chick.’ Chicken parm is ‘chicky-chicky-parm-parm.’ Chicken cacciatore? ‘Chicky-cacc.’ I call eggs ‘pre-birds,’ or ‘future birds.’ Root beer is ‘super water.’ Tortillas are ‘bean blankets.’ And I call forks ‘food rakes.’ || Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants, I just give her the names of rappers. Those are some Diddies. Those are some Bone Thugs-N-Harmoniums, right here. Those Ludacrises are coming in great. || At the risk bragging, one of the things I’m best at is riding coattails. Behind every successful man is me, smiling and taking partial credit. || Fiddling knobs, touching keys, having fun with a full grown man. || I was a dishwasher at one of those Japanese places that cook on your table. Not too fun. || Sometimes you gotta work a little, so you can ball a lot. || Oh, what’s this in my shoe? Red carpet insole. Everywhere I go, I’m walking on red carpet. || After you do a joke a few times, you have material that you know works. Although sometimes I have a joke that has worked a bunch of times and then one night it'll flop. And that's when I really take a hard look at myself and say: 'Well, that crowd is obviously wrong. That crowd has absolutely no idea what it's talking about.' || I'm kind of obsessed with food. I like to eat. || It's all dangerously true. It'd be nice if something worked out for me, and then I'd have to get material out of that. || You don’t know Jay-Z’s schedule. He’s a Renaissance man. || The best thing I ever heard about doing comedy is that it’s the ""business of rejection"". || Dude on my flight is watching Men in Black 3, watching with no sound & pretending its a Hitch sequel bout Hitch trying hookup an alien. || When I bet on horses, I never lose. Why? I bet on all the horses. || I strapped an MP3 player to one of those floor-cleaning robots. Call him DJ Roomba - little guy cruises around and plays music. What’s hot, DJ Roomba! || Yeah, I’ve been a little down. Totally natural. I’m getting a divorce, but now I’m ready to pull myself up by some G-strings. || Every time I've done comedy in, like, traditional comedy clubs, there's always these comedians that do really well with audiences but that the other comedians hate because they're just, you know, doing kind of cheap stuff like dancing around or doing, like, very kind of base sex humor a lot, and stuff like that. || Breaking is tough, turns are tough, but telling your parents you’re gay is the hardest part of rollerblading. || Let's have a moment of silence for all the chubby Asian dudes that are getting 'Gangnam style!' yelled at them by bros around the world. || One of my life goals is to be a best man. It’s a baller position. You get drunk, you make speeches, and you make love to the prettiest bridesmaid. Usually standing from behind. || No one’s trying to get with jugglers. || I can’t keep referring to basketball players as Khloe Kardashian’s husband and his friends. || Oh, am I wearing an ascot? I didn’t notice. || Modern life. Where are we running? Sometimes what we want is not always where we are... Are we alone? Is the real winter inside our hearts? We are all struggling for definition in a world that resists our increase. || A lot of people my age think stand up sucks. || If your job was remotely interesting, there would be a show on A&E about it. || Everyone steals. My favorite movie is Love Don’t Cost a Thing with Nick Cannon. Which is based on Can’t Buy Me Love, which is based on Kramer vs. Kramer, or something, which I think was Shakespeare. || Come on, man, I got a full beard! || I want to open up my own club one day, maybe call it something like Club a Dub Dub, or the Club Marine. Sort of a submarine-themed club. Or Tom’s Bistro. The word ""bistro"" is classy as shit. || Every now and then, we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered. One time, I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up. || Well, MTV isn't really my cup of tea... mainly because I hate huge pieces of shit in my tea. || I have never taken the high road, but I tell other people to ’cause then there’s more room for me on the low road. || You missed a crazy party dude. I woke up with glitter on my dick! || Like with Parks and Recreation, it's so much fun because the people writing it are funny and they're open and you just go in there and have a good time. It's pretty much the easiest job I've ever had."
Bernie Mac,"I would like to give these kids a good home. In fact, there's one a few miles away from here... || I wanted to be the best that I could be, first for myself, then for an audience. I love to see a smile on somebody's face... If I can tell someone a story that makes them bend over and laugh, that's bigger than anything else. || Son of bitch kids too God damn smart for me. Sassy-talking, shaking heads and shit. “Talk to the hand. Talk to the hand.” See, I’m from the old school, I’ll kick a kid ass. When a kid gets one years old, I believe you have the right to hit them in the throat or the stomach. if you’re grown enough to talk back, you’re grown up enough to get fucked up. || I ain't scared of you motherfuckers! || If you don't bust a nut when I bust a nut... then you fresh outta fucking luck wit' me! || Okay, first rule of this carpool. No breaking wind in my car. The only gas that Bernie Mac want to be smelling is unleaded. || Whatever you hear at the barber shop, stays at the barber shop. || I will fuck a kid up. When a kid gets one-years-old, I believe you got the right to hit him in either the throat or the stomach. If you grown enough to talk back, you grown enough to get fucked up! || When white people go on break at their job. 15 minutes. They go to their desk. They eat their cheese sandwich. Drink their God damn tea. 15 minutes they’re back on the fucking job. My people I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with us. But when we go on break, that’s just what the fuck we do…. we break. You got to look for our motherfucking ass. “You seen Johnny?” || They say if you don't have your health you ain't got nothing, but the truth is you ain't got nothing if you don't have no one to worry about your health. || Do no touch my TV, my CD, my DVD, my VHS, my old school, my new school. Got it? || Shut up before I drop yo ass off at Koreatown. Now hold on, America, don't start writing no letters. I'm just kidding. But am I lying? || Jerry Weintraub, the producer, might be a pain in the ass, but he really knows how to treat his actors. || Whatever success I've had, I always like to top it. || I'm not a star, and I don't want to be a star. Stars fall. || You've got guys in charge of shows who probably went to school for chemistry, and now they're executive producers. || Making people laugh is what I've been doing since I was like four or five years old. I still have a lust, I still have a passion. I don't care about how I look, I'm dedicated to the laughs. || I have Glocks, .45s, Berettas, Remingtons. I like the marksmanship and the discipline that it takes to be a gun owner. I like the machinery. Being able to take it out and clean it is even more fascinating than having the gun. || Every time you see a black romance it's over-the-top. There always has to be extreme hostility between the sexes. He has to cheat. She has to show him how independently strong she is, not just as a woman but as a black woman. || I was living in a place where I was harming myself. I was irresponsible. I`d lost several apartments. I couldn`t hold a job. I was tired of being a no-good son of a bitch who called himself a man but was just a grown boy. || 'The Bernie Mac Show' is my life. It's the truth, and I'm not ashamed of a minute, an hour, or a second of my life. || When I get a chance to play golf or go on a boat with good people, take the boat out and put some lobsters on the grill, get the ice-cold beer and the cigars - that's heaven here on earth. || I had a white guy tell me... he said, ""Bern, why do black folks use the word 'mother-fucker?'"" Well, I'm gonna break down what the word ""mother-fucker"" actually means. ""Mother-fucker"" is somethin' that black folks have been using for years. It's about expression. Don't be ashamed of the word ""mother-fucker."" Because the word ""mother-fucker"" is a noun: it describes a person, place, or thing! || I'm an ordinary guy with an extraordinary job. || You know you’re black motherfucka when you put fingerprints on charcoal."
Bill Bellamy,"Oh my god, Jenny McCarthy is the coolest chick. She's the kind of girl you can play volleyball with and she's diggin' it out in the dirt. She's the girl that's playing softball - not worrying about breaking a nail. She's out there breaking nails and diving at second. And then, she's going to out-drink you at the bar. || Man, I’m having a good time man, I found out something recently, I wanna share with you all. Do you know if you have a new baby, you can’t bring your own baby home unless you have a car seat, do you know that? It is a law that you need a car seat to bring your baby home. Question is, how we get home? There were no car seat when I was a baby. I’m going to tell you that right now, my momma would drive with the baby, smoking Newport, hitting the brakes, oh, there go the baby. Oh my baby, I know, it made me mess up my cigarette, this is crazy. || The things I talk about in my comedy are my experiences. I just do what I know. || Yeah, I had to wear a speedo! And I must have weighed like a buck thirty, lookin' like I was in dire need of a serious turkey dinner. I went out on a limb. I was not Mr. Sexy at all - I was very skinny and boney. || When they turn 26, women start asking really weird questions like, ""Where are we? Where are we?"" Bitch, we at Red Lobster. Why you tripping? || 50 Cent is a hero to me because he's overcome so many things. He's been shot nine times and lived. I had a cousin got shot once in the ankle. Dead. I had to go to the funeral. I was mad. ""Man, you ain't hard! You ain't hard!"" || I think it go serious in college when I found out I really enjoyed making people laugh. It makes me happy. I said, ""I wanna be a comedian, I wanna get good.' You're not good in the beginning. You're still trying to figure out what the things are that you are going to talk about, what your angle is going to be and there's a lot of trial and error. I just never gave up and that was the beginning of my career. Just experimenting, trying it out and falling in love with it. || It is some beautiful women in Atlanta. Well, let me tell you, I don’t, I don’t know what ya’ll doing in the water, oh, you women down here are so fine, you can look at a woman with your girl, she would be like, yeah, you’re right, go ahead. She is gorgeous, do it, that’s it, that’s all you get."
Bill Burr,"I din’t do shit today. Almost till 4 o clock I just watch TV, so i’m a loser. || 'Several NFL players said they would support a team mate that came out as gay...' Yeah, why wouldn't you?! || Nothing makes a white guy feel safer than seeing a trolly, you never feel you're gonna get fucked up when you're around a trolly. || His tattoos are like shit that you wrote on the cover of your notebook. || Whats up with all these guys killing their wives now? Like, every couple of weeks in the news, you see that shit... guys killing their wives. I don't understand it. First of all, why would you kill another person, and second of all, don't they think the whole thing through? Like, how the whole things gonna play out? Like, I'm gonna kill my wife, then I'm gonna get caught, then I'm gonna go to jail, then I'm gonna get fucked in the ass. || This beautiful woman has something written on the side of her body, it says, ""whatever is not the stars to hold our destinies, but in ourselves""... I just don’t under - why? why? why do people do that? Is that for when she’s hookin’ up with some guy, right? And he’s bangin’ her doggy style and he kinda leans over, and he looks and then he reads that, and like what’s he supposed to think then? Like, ""Da... this bitch is deep!"" || If this goes into sweatshop labor, I’m quitting this podcast. || The first guy who got Aids was a French flight attendant. How you like that Frenchie! You know when I come back and run for office, that may be the one that comes back and haunts me. || You’re good looking for a redhead... yea, well you’re not good looking for a person. || Now, if they were just honest about it and were like, 'Look, this guy's going to die in, like, seven or eight minutes; I'm going to get a bag of cash and a Lexus,' I wouldn't have a problem with it. || Put your head down, don’t be a dick, and you’ll get in. || Oh look an ATM! Ok here we go! I lost all my money, now what do I do? Get a gun! Rob a casino! Good idea! Look at all the lights! This is beautiful. || You wanna know how you know you’re informed as a protestor? They don’t show your interview on TV. || I heard a quote once in a documentary about a band that said you're better off owning everything 100 percent and selling 20,000 copies of an album than signing with a record company and selling a million copies. There has never been a truer statement about show business than that. || Haven’t you noticed that every time the government fucks up McDonald’s has a new sandwich? || Seriously, any other town you go to there's this little devil and a little angel on your shoulder. A little good advice, a little bad advice.You go to Las Vegas, there's like a devil and a devil and they're just battling it out the whole time. It's like, 'Smoke some crack!' 'Get a hooker!' And then I go, 'Yea! Yea, this is a good town. Smoke some crack and get a hooker! Alright!' || Dave Chappelle was great. He's just the way he is in the wraparounds on the show. He's a really laid back guy. Just doing five skits on his show gave me enough exposure where I was able to move up a few notches, which was like night and day from where I was in this business. So I'm always thanking him. || I’ve never wanted to kill myself over anything major. It’s always the little things that do me in. || I love the Spurs and their white guy basketball that they play. I absolutely love their fundamentally sound pick and roll, fucking kiss it off the glass, ‘I can’t jump either’ game that they play, it’s tremendous. There’s not a lotta white guys out there doing it, but when I watch the Spurs play, it looks like 5 white guys playing pick-up at the Y. || Fuck this I'm going to get a pumpkin. || I'd be like, 'Lady, get the hell away from me! You're old, you're gross... I'm sorry. I'm sure you were unbelievable back in the 20's, when you were doing the Charleston, making beer in your bathtub, but you're at least four decades past humpable. I'm sorry.' || I think it's a really selfish thing, especially if your guy isn't making a lot of money, to make him go out and blow money on a shiny fucking rock that was dug out of the ground by a fucking 8 year old. Ya know? Just because you're not mature enough as an adult to walk up to all your other girlfriends with your engagement ring and letting it be something other than a diamond or at the very least letting it be a diamond that your future husband can afford. || Let’s go to Brunch. What a great idea! Why would you want to sleep in on a Sunday when you can go pay $18 for eggs? Now, you’re thinking. || Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around. || You better believe that they wanna make all their fucking friends jealous, okay? And the greatest thing that could ever happen is if one of their friends is already married and if you go a couple of carats bigger and they can fucking pull that out. That's like their biggest dick competition is whoever has the shiniest fucking rock. You know what I mean? It really is fucking stupid. || Having a dick is one of the most dangerous things on the planet. How many people are eaten by sharks each year? How many guys lose everything they've got because of their dick? Yet the Discovery Channel has Shark week every other fucking month. Why doesn't it have Dick Week? That would be the scariest seven days in the history of television. || I used to always work in, like, warehouses, because if my boss gave me a rough time, I could just get on a forklift and just, like, drive away from him. || You're a kid, your whole life is awesome. It's awesome, right? You had no money, no ID, no cell phone, no nothing, no keys to the house. You just ran outside into the woods. You weren't scared of nothing. I challenge you to do that as an adult. All your IDs, all your credit cards - just run out of the house with no phone, turn the corner where you can't see your house, and not have a full on panic attack. || When I go to church, I can't get past the fact that I'm just listening to some fuckin' guy. Do you ever think of that shit when you go in there? That's just some dude. And people are like, 'No! That's a special guy.' No it isn't! It isn't. No, he didn't levitate down from the ceiling with this white light around him. Why would you listen to another human being tell you where you're gonna go when you die? It's just like: 'Dude, have you ever been dead? No. Great. So wouldn't it be safe to assume that you wouldn't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talking about? Yeah, you're making it up. You're making the shit up. You're not fooling me with the robes and the candles, speakin' in old English, 'He saideth unto you-eth'. Shut the fuck up, you don't talk like that. You're just some guy, your names Jerry, you play soccer, you got your ass kicked in gym class, and now you're doin' this.' || You know why men make more money than women? Because, in the unlikely event that we're both on the Titanic and it starts to sink, for some reason, you get to leave with the kids and I have to stay - that's why I get the dollar more an hour. || Serbia? Isn’t that the place that Clinton bombed because he stuck that cigar in that girl’s twat? || I bet The Walking Dead gets really low ratings out in Montana, just because all they need to do is look out their fucking window, am I right? || 'I was in heaven and I was in hell, believe in neither but fear them as well'... damn! Were you really in heaven and were you in hell? Here on earth or did you visit another land? This fucking jerk off… || You know what a cubicle basically says? It basically says, like, 'You know what? We don't think you're smart enough for an office, but we don't want you to look at anybody.' || I think racists know at this point that they've probably got to keep their ideas to themselves unless they're at one of those Klan meetings. You know bunch of douchebags sitting around with a fucking comforter thrown over your face, just fucking getting all sweaty under there, your face breaking out. You know? Whats wrong with those people? || It's weird, when you buy a house you just suddenly become really conservative. Before, when I rented, I didn't give a shit if there was a homeless guy jerking off on the street. I thought it was funny. 'Look at that guy right outside my window! Who needs cable when that guys sitting there rubbin' one out? Look at the lady runnin'!' It was great. But once you buy... every fuckin' little thing. 'Ahhh there's a pothole down the street that needs to be covered!' || Fuck all of you, and fuck the Liberty Bell, and shove it up Ben Franklin’s ass. || Fast food I think is like a conspiracy, y’know. I think that’s how they just keep us dumb. You can’t even think after a while, you ever notice that shit? Like you ever had your whole day planned out, you eat one egg McMuffin and you’re just on the couch, ‘Eh, y’know what, fuck my dreams.’ || As much as Metallica rocked, they always had these song names... ‘The Thing That Shouldn’t Be’. ‘The Chair That Wasn’t There’, you know? || Some guy workin’ at Home Depot, he wants to fuck just as many women as a celebrity. But he can’t do it, because whores don’t care about lumber. || Black guys with dirty sneakers scare the shit out of me. || Inter-racial sex is probably some of the best sex on the planet. You know what that is? Because with inter-racial sex there’s like this whole added pressure to perform. ‘Cause it’s kinda like you’re not just humping for yourself. You’re humping for your race. You got to represent your people. || Are any terrorists listening to this podcast? Are ya? In a fuckin' cave right now jerkin' off to your 72 virgins or whatever the hell they're promising ya. First of all, they're not there. When ya die, ya go in the ground. Okay? That's where you're goin'. So what ya wanna do is ya wanna try to stay alive. Ya know? Meet yourself a cute fuckin' lady. Have a cookout. Ride a bicycle; feel the wind in your fuckin' hair... or in your beard. Ya know? Whata ya doin'? || Do you know how many times a week people ask me why I'm yelling? || I am so pro-swine flu... I want it. We need a plague. It's got to happen; don't be afraid. It's only going to kill the weak. || You know what I like about George Bush? He makes me feel like I could be president, too. No, he does. He's like the first guy, like, from my reading level, you know... the first guy, like, from my math class to finally go out and do something! || I think Twitter is really great for those comics that are good with the one-liners. The thing about the Internet is that there are so many different things you can do, as a comic, to get yourself out there. It could be YouTube, it could be Twitter, it could be blogging. On the Internet, it's like I have my own little store. I have a bunch of YouTube videos up, and it's like, 'Check out these videos and if you like what I do, come check me out and if not... no harm, no foul.' || There's no 'brothers' when it comes to white people. We are just complete individuals. We don't care about each other. He's not my brother; my brother lives in Ohio... I don't know that guy. || It's not until you're an adult you appreciate how awesome a dog is. Your dreams start dying, somebody cheats on ya, bankers fuck up your 401k, ya know? Then ya come home and that dog's looking at you and he's like, 'Dude, you're awesome!' It's like No, dude you... You are fucking awesome!' || I actually had the urge to elbow an elderly lady today... || Only an adult with dying dreams can appreciate how awesome it is to have a dog. || What’s that, son? Nah, we’re not going to church today, fuck that. It’s all a bunch of bullshit. God’s everywhere, but I gotta go down there to see him? Really? And he’s mad at me down there, and I owe you money? Go fuck yourself. || There's this critical point where you've stayed single for too long and your brain switches from 'You know, maybe I shouldn't say that.' to 'Eh, fuck it, say it, see what happens.' || You have no idea how long a year is until you’re stone sober. || I was scared to death because for the comics of my generation, HBO specials are like the pinnacle. I'm thinking of all these unbelievable comedians I've seen on HBO: Chris Rock, George Carlin, Damon Wayans, Richard Pryor and Billy Crystal. I started having a panic attack seeing my name in that list of people. It was pretty overwhelming. || A good story is always you doing something wrong, you know? That's why nice people are so damn boring. I mean, they're nice, but their stories suck. || Pitbulls are like a gun you can pet. || Do you guys realize how fucked I am if Christianity is actually 100% correct? Do you understand about the fucking - the god damn 2 bed room suite they’re already preparing for me in hell’s fire? Do you really believe that there’s a guy in the sky? I think there is. I think, ya know - actually, I don’t. I think when you believe in that stuff, this is my own personal opinion: you’re just too dumb to figure shit out for yourself. || You know that dumb song 'More money, more problems'? Yeah, because you're goin' down to the fuckin' titty bar with money hangin' out of your pocket, dumpin' Cristal all over a rug in front of people who work in cubicles. More titty bars, more problems... is really what it is. || Gold diggers are the wife beaters of men! || Women want you to suffer. You know what I mean? They want you to go 4 to 8 grand in debt. They want you to do that, and go to work every fucking day, knowing that you're working for their fucking love and the use of their fucking vagina. || Rednecks are like America's pit bulls. They should just sedate those people, drop 'em off in Afghanistan, just let them run wild. Just be like, 'Dude, just go do everything you ever dreamed of doing. Just go crazy. Have one of your friends play the banjo... it'll scare the hell out of them.' || You know, I have to admit, I saw this robbery coming from a mile away, which is why I put my car keys up my ass."
Bill Cosby,"The past is a ghost, the future a dream, and all we ever have is now. || You go and you buy a lottery ticket. You've got just as much chance of getting struck by lightning as you do of winning the lottery. || But if that's what you want to be, that's what you will be - as long as you study. || In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. || It is a point of pride for the American male to keep the same size jockey shorts for his entire life. || You can never give complete authority and overall power to anyone until trust can be proven. || What is it about grandparents that is so lovely? I'd like to say that grandparents are God's gifts to children. And if they can but see, hear and feel what these people have to give, they can mature at a fast rate. || Fatherhood is asking your son to make up a name rather than tell anybody who he is. || The main goal of the future is to stop violence. The world is addicted to it. || The summit, which is set up to educate people about managing their money and protecting their income, leads to empowerment of self, for which this summit needs to be applauded. || Thank you for remembering me. I'm also happy to be accepting this trophy before I become incontinent. || I was told maybe nine years ago by an executive who was working for a major network that the networks from now on are going to be entertaining 13-year-old people, and that's what you see today. || It's painful, but we can't heal ourselves unless we cleanse the wounds. || It doesn't have to be that way. || I'm here for a friend. I brought a couple of boxes of chocolate Jell-O. || The beautiful thing about older people is their ability to cut the fat off of conversation. When they talk, they don't go on forever and ever. They say what they have to say, and that's it. That was my grand dad. Some of the things he said stunned me, but his words were logical. I'll never forget them. || It's more blessed to give than to receive - especially kittens. || Sex education may be a good idea in the schools, but I don't believe the kids should be given homework. || Take that money and build something you can see... something for the children. || You know my father's favorite game? ""Come here and pull my finger."" || I want to die before my wife, and the reason is this: If it is true that when you die, your soul goes up to judgment, I don't want my wife up there ahead of me to tell them things. || Is the glass half full, or half empty? It depends on whether you're pouring, or drinking. || That's why ears have cartilage, to keep them from flapping. || The very first law in advertising is to avoid the concrete promise and cultivate the delightfully vague. || Beware of people who fall at your feet. They may be reaching for the corner of the rug. || Your parents put a curse on you Someday your kids are going to act just like you. || College was a wonderful time - except, of course, when it was trying to teach you things. || I was lying, of course: that's what parents do best. || Women don't want to hear what you think. Women want to hear what they think - in a deeper voice. || Gray hair is God's graffiti. || Anyone can dabble, but once you've made that commitment, your blood has that particular thing in it, and it's very hard for people to stop you. || I am not the boss of my house. I don't know how I lost it. I don't know when I lost it. I don't think I ever had it. But I've seen the boss's job and I don't want it. || My wife and I have five children; the reason we have five children is because we do not want six. || Kids will spend $500 on sneakers but won`t spend $200 on ""Hooked-on-Phonics"". || Every father says the same thing: ""Where's your mother?"" || Fatherhood is helping your children learn English as a foreign language. || My father walked to school, 4'oclock every morning. With no shoes on. Up a hill, both ways in 5 feet of snow, and he was thankful. || In my old neighborhood, a boy stopped playing when he began to lose his pulse. And then he became the referee. || A pelican that is wet walks with a gated limp, but a dry fish swims alone. || Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it. || It says here that you are a compulsive gambler and that you are wanted by the police. Is this correct? || Sigmund Freud once said, ""What do women want?"" The only thing I have learned in fifty-two years is that women want men to stop asking dumb questions like that. || Civilization had too many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them. || After you take off your coats, go to sleep... Then in the morning I'll take you all home. || How long can you tread water? || We go out of our way to make people so different,... to punish them because of color, because of sex, because of size, and the game starts. || A sail boat that sails backwards can never see the sun rise. || What best defines a child is the total inability to receive information from anything not plugged in. || No parent must ever say, ""Get the kids out of here, I'm trying to watch TV."" The father who does start saying this is likely to see one of his children on the 6:00 news. || Have you ever had a cookie? Then you won't get any here either. || A person that is going to go out and get so drunk that you're going to get sick is just an, all-time dumb person. || She (his wife) is the wind beneath my wings. || These people marched and were hit in the face with rocks to get an education and now we've got these knuckleheads walking around. || I just felt wonderful about that. Just to erase all that mess about,""'Well, I'm either flipping burgers or doing drugs, you know, or getting shot."" You know, that kind of a thing. || One of the beauties of watching our show is that, really and truly, it remains fresh because you're dealing with human beings and their behavior. || Never say to younger people ""that was before your time,"" because the last full moon was before their time! || Old is always fifteen years from now. || We're the geniuses of the house because only a person intelligent as we could fake such stupidity. || When you become senile, you won't know it. || My grandpa didn't believe in hugging and kissing, or saying ""I love you."" His love had to do with the way he treated you. When he said, ""We're going here, we're going there,"" he was telling me about life. That was his love for me. My love for him was listening to what he said, keeping out of trouble, doing right, being fair. || I wanted to give the house back to the parents. || Give me 200 active 2-year-olds and I could conquer the world. || Why do kids always say peace out, I though peace was in. || This happened to the people. The Constitution says ""of the people, by the people, for the people""... but the people who got the office, got into office and forgot about the people. || Your rooms are as filthy today as they were when you graduated from high school. And we want them cleaned up. || You also notice that the right side of your face feels like it's sliding off of your skull. And your bottom lip is in your lap! || Look, I'm not going to put pressure on the boy. If he's good... Great. If he's bad... If he quits, he's dead. || Try to be rational? I'll tell you how rational I can be. I hope that he goes out into the wilderness and gets poision ivy, and comes back and I have to treat him then he will find out how much sick people get charged. || What's your name again? That's right. I'm so glad you know your name. || Repeat after me. I promise not to run outside of the house. I promise not to run inside of the house. I promise not to touch, pick up, step on, anything that looks interesting. || I've got a Ferrari. VROOM! I do 104 from the garage to the front door. || There's no reason for him to come here and jump on black men who have been held down for years. || One of the great mistakes that can be made by a man of my age is to get involved in athletic competition with children - unless, of course, they are under six. And even then, stay away from hide-and-seek. || On many young actors that don't give their parents proper credit: I'm still waiting for some actor to win, say, an Oscar... and deliver the following acceptance speech: I would like to thank my parents, first of all, for letting me live. || I'm not sure if my parents had me because they loved me, or because they wanted someone to watch their other children. || I can tell you, from experience, that whoever said ""Children and fools cannot lie"" was one or the other himself. There`s only one way to guarantee that your children are telling the truth: limit your questions to the names of their schools. || You can teach an old dog new tricks. You just don't want to watch the dog doing them. || The problem is that your daughter has given her heart to a 15-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old boy does not yet qualify as a human being. || My mother was an authority on pigsties. This is the worst looking pigsty I've ever seen in my life. || My wife was a beautiful woman before we had children. || All children have brain damage! || Man can not live by bread alone... he must have peanut butter. || When the child is twelve, your wife buys her a splendidly silly article of clothing called a training bra. To train what? I never had a training jock. And believe me, when I played football, I could have used a training jock more than any twelve-year-old needs a training bra. || ""And tired"" always followed sick. Worst beating I ever got in my life, my mother said, ""I am just sick..."" And I said, ""and tired."" I don't remember anything after that. || I'm not saying looting is good, ... But I'm saying surely at a time when your child needs diapers and you need food, when does looting stop... || And to those people with no children but who think they'd like to have them some day to fulfill their lives. Remember: With fulfillment comes responsibility. || We have many things in common, the greatest of which is that we are both afraid of the children. || The childless experts on child raising also bring tears of laughter to my eyes when they say, ""I love children because they're so honest."" There is not an agent in the CIA or the KGB who knows how to conceal the theft of food, how to fake being asleep, or how to forge a parent's signature like a child. || Raising children is an incredibly hard and risky business in which no cumulative wisdom is gained: each generation repeats the mistakes the previous one made. || My father established our relationship when I was seven years old. He looked at me and said, ""You know, I brought you in this world, and I can take you out. And it don't make no difference to me, I'll make another one look just like you."" || I guess the real reason that my wife and I had children is the same reason that Napoleon had for invading Russia: it seemed like a good idea at the time. || I am proud to be an American. Because an American can eat anything on the face of this earth as long as he has two pieces of bread. || A baseball manager has learned a lot about his job from having played the game, but a parent has not learned a thing from having once been a child. || I am certainly not an authority on love because there are no authorities on love, just those who've had luck with it and those who haven't. || Even though your kids will consistently do the exact opposite of what you're telling them to do, you have to keep loving them just as much. || My childhood should have taught me lessons for my own fatherhood, but it didn't because parenting can only be learned by people who have no children. || You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in anything, even poverty, you can survive it. || Poets have said that the reason to have children is to give yourself immortality. Immortality? Now that I have five children, my only hope is that they are all out of the house before I die. || My eleven year old daughter mopes around the house all day waiting for her breasts to grow. || The heart of marriage is memories; and if the two of you happen to have the same ones and can savor your reruns, then your marriage is a gift from the gods. || A husband is what is left of the lover after the nerve has been extracted. || No matter how calmly you try to referee, parenting will eventually produce bizarre behavior, and I'm not talking about the kids. Their behavior is always normal. || In spite of the seven thousands books of expert advice, the right way to discipline a child is still a mystery to most fathers and... mothers. Only your grandmother and Ghengis Khan know how to do it. || Any man today who returns from work, sinks into a chair, and calls for his pipe is a man with an appetite for danger. || People can be more forgiving than you can imagine. But you have to forgive yourself. Let go of what's bitter and move on. || Always end the name of your child with a vowel, so that when you yell the name will carry. || My father confused me. From the ages of one to seven, I thought my name was Jesus Christ! || A grandchild is God’s reward for raising a child. || Nothing separates the generations more than music. By the time a child is eight or nine, he has developed a passion for his own music that is even stronger than his passions for procrastination and weird clothes. || Human beings are the only creatures on earth that allow their children to come back home. || A word to the wise ain't necessary - it's the stupid ones that need the advice. || People will frighten you about a graduation...They use words you don't hear often... ""And we wish you Godspeed."" It is a warning, Godpeed. It means you are no longer welcome here at these prices. || There is hope for the future because God has a sense of humor and we are funny to God. || It`s the little things that count when you`re a daddy. Like taking your little girl for ice cream. First, you have to teach her about the concept of gravity. I can`t tell you how many ice creams I`ve had to pick up off the floor, rinse off and stick back on my kid`s cone. Now that may sound strange, but have you bought ice cream lately? Good gosh, it`s up to 75 cents a scoop. A scoop! What`s in it, gold? || I feel that in-person contact with people is the most important thing in comedy. While I'm up on stage, I can actually put myself into the audience and adjust my pace and tuning to them. I can get into their heads through their ears and through their eyes. Only through this total communication can I really achieve what I'm trying to do. || Advertising is the most fun you can have with your clothes on. || I recently turned fifty, which is young for a tree, midlife for an elephant, and ancient for a quarter miler, who's son now says, ""Dad, I just can't run the quarter with you anymore unless I bring something to read."" || If the new American father feels bewildered and even defeated, let him take comfort from the fact that whatever he does in any fathering situation has a fifty percent chance of being right. || If you're a parent, the five worst words you can say to your children are, ""When I was your age ..."" You were never their age. You were older in the womb. || Ladies and gentlemen, the lower economic and lower middle economic people are not holding their end in this deal. In the neighborhood that most of us grew up in, parenting is not going on. || Nobody ever says, ""Can I have your beets?"" || I asked my father for a dollar for the school picnic, he told me how he killed a grizzly bear with his loose-leaf notebook. || Ours is a youth culture, and like a golf tournament, we honor only low scores. || In spite of what Thomas Jefferson wrote, all men may be created equal, but not to all women. || In spite of the six thousand manuals on child raising in the bookstores, child raising is still a dark continent and no one really knows anything. You just need a lot of love and luck - and, of course, courage. || It isn't a matter of black is beautiful as much as it is white is not all that's beautiful. || Nothing I've ever done has given me more joys and rewards than being a father to my children. || Immortality is a long shot, I admit. But somebody has to be first. || I said to a guy, ""Tell me, what is it about cocaine that makes it so wonderful"" and he said, ""Because it intensifies your personality."" I said, ""Yes, but what if you're an asshole?"" || Some authority on parenting once said, ""Hold them very close and then let them go."" This is the hardest truth for a father to learn: that his children are continuously growing up and moving away from him (until, of course, they move back in). || You know the only people who are always sure about the proper way to raise children? Those who've never had any. || I wasn't always black... there was this freckle, and it got bigger and bigger. || Did you ever see the customers in health-food stores? They are pale, skinny people who look half dead. In a steak house, you see robust, ruddy people. They're dying, of course, but they look terrific. || A new father quickly learns that his child invariably comes to the bathroom at precisely the times when he's in there, as if he needed company. The only way for this father to be certain of bathroom privacy is to shave at the gas station. || Like everyone else who makes the mistake of getting older, I begin each day with coffee and obituaries. || The worst thing to do is to die while reading LIFE magazine. || I was a physical education major with a child psychology minor at Temple, which means if you ask me a question about a child's behavior, I will advise you to tell the child to take a lap. || There is no labor a person does that is undignified; if they do it right. || If the new American father feels bewildered and even defeated, let him take comfort from the fact that whatever he does in any fathering situation has a fifty percent chance of being right. || I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody. || Men and women belong to different species and communications between them is still in its infancy. || That married couples can live together day after day is a miracle the Vatican has overlooked. || Lasting harmony with a woman (was) an undertaking in which I twice failed rather disgracefully. || Parents are not interested in justice, they're interested in peace and quiet. || Having a child is surely the most beautifully irrational act that two people in love can commit. || The essence of childhood, of course, is play, which my friends and I did endlessly on streets that we reluctantly shared with traffic. || Fatherhood is pretending the present you love most is soap on-a-rope. || Children today know more about sex than I or my father did. || As I have discovered by examining my past, I started out as a child. Coincidentally, so did my brother. My mother did not put all her eggs in one basket, so to speak: she gave me a younger brother named Russell, who taught me what was meant by survival of the fittest. || Let us now set forth one of the fundamental truths about marriage: the wife is in charge."
Bill Engvall,"I go ""it wasn't my fault, it was Captain Morgan!"" And my wife goes ""Oh, like when Jose Cuervo made you ride the floor buffer?"", and I said ""Exactly!"" || A condom is a rubber thing shaped like a wiener that hums. || And isn’t that weird? Think about this, when you’re born, you nurse on your mama. And then you get a little older, you go to applesauce. And then you see these toddlers walking around with these Ziploc baggies full of Cheerios. Then you get to be my age, and the doctor wants you to start eating Cheerios to watch your cholesterol. Then you lose your teeth, you go to applesauce. I now know why old men like women with really big boobs. They see a trend. I mean, they call it a nursing home, hello. || In 1903 the Wright brothers invented airplanes, because in 1902 they took a road trip across the country with their family. || No parents. You have Uncle Jesse, forever in overalls. Then there's Bo and Duke. What do they do? I never saw them working for food or gas money. You can only kill so many possum. || Martial sex is kinda like ordering a Civil War chess set through the mail. You get one piece every four to six weeks, you don't know what kind of shape that piece is gonna be in when you get it, but you still gotta pay the handling charges. || I thought ""RV"" stood for ""Recreational Vehicle."" No! It stands for ""Ruins Vacations."" || Lady, I didn't get up this morning wanting to be a jackass... but you just pushed my jackass button. || My bitch in high school had a 12 foot boa constrictor, she named it Fluffy. That's just sick in my book. Well, we go over to her house, I don't know about the snake, and she says, ""Hang on while I get into something more comfortable, okay?"" and I'm like, ""All right!"" A few minutes later, she comes out wearing that snake around her neck, I'm backin' away, saying, ""No thanks, I can drive."" She says to me, ""No, wait, Bill. Fluffy can wrap around us while we make love."" I said, ""No, he can't. 'Cause I'll kill him. Okay?"" || I believe that Lady Gaga is like a carnival ride. From a distance she looks fun, but up close, you don’t wanna climb on that. || I believe that if you want to wear a thong, you should have to go through an application process. || As we're staggering out of the hospital, I don't remember doing this because I was still high, but apparently I turned to the entire operating room staff and screamed ""hey! I'd better not see this on YouTube!"" || Cause he's driving 200 miles an hour & he don't have the luxury having his wife sitting right there telling him how to drive. || Webster's dictionary defines awesome as ""anything that leaves you in awe and wonder."" Like winning the lottery twice. That would be awesome. Getting a phone call from the IRS saying you've been audited and they owe you $50,000. That would be awesome. Ladies, you wake up tomorrow and the newspaper reads ""Scientists have discovered a way for men to experience childbirth."" That would be awesome. Getting invited to the Playboy Mansion on trampoline night. That would be awesome. And I started thinking what would be awesome for Bill Engvall? What would leave me in awe and wonder? And it would have to be if I left this stage tonight and went back to my hotel room. And Shania Twain met me at my door, wearing nothing but a fur coat, holding a note from my wife that said ""have a good time."" That would be awesome! It ain't gonna happen; but that would be awesome. || No, I got a better one. If you ever crack open a beer during a eulogy, you might be a redneck. || Who applies for that job? Who says ""I want to work in lost luggage""? You don't have a good day. That's like having a job emptying port-a-potties. You're just going to catch crap all day long. || My son developed this really bad habit. He would come to my side of the bed and he’d get that close to my face. And just stare at me. You ever get that feeling when you know you’re being watched? He’s be like: “Dad… Dad… Da-” “What? What? What?” He starts crying. My wife goes, “You scared him!” I’m like, “Hell, he scared me! Jesus, put a bell round his neck!” || I go ""what is it?"" And she goes ""we're going on a shark feeding frenzy!"" Okay, wait... we're in a boat looking down in the water? ""No, that's the best part! We're in the water with the sharks!"" And I go ""have you lost your mind?"" || I was traveling down the road with a buddy and there's a guy driving around in a jeep with a dead deer strapped to the hood. My buddy says to me ""you think he's been hunting?"" ""Nope, They're probably giving them away with the purchase of every jeep."" Here's your sign! || That's why dogs are man's best friend. 'Cause guys want buddies that are dumber than they are. So do women, but they've already got men. || We're in the process of remodeling our house; we've been doing it for a while now. And we have the painters in, putting sheets up around the furniture, you know? And we have a piano, just a regular, up against the wall piano. One of the painters said to me, ""Is that y'all's piano?"" I said, ""Nah, that's our coffee table, it just has buckteeth!"" Here's your sign! || If you thought Stairway to Heaven was a long song, dear god you should listen to it played on a lute. || I thought, ""I'm gonna try that at my house!"" Well apparently, bologna and string cheese is not a real big turn on to a blindfolded woman. || Boobs are the center of power. Boobs can make a 6-month old baby and a 65 year old man both act the same way. And I'm a big fan. Oh, man, I love 'em! And I ain't picky neither. I hate guys that say ""I don't like little boobs."" I don't care! Big boobs, little boobs, saggy boobs, perky boobs... You could have boobs that look like nanners, I don't give a damn! They're the perfect toy! You squish them, mush them, POOF! They come right back out! You can't even break 'em! Oh god, they're amazing. Boobs can make a long trip seem short, make a bad day seem great. Bud, let's say you had a bad day at work. Boss been chewing you out all day long. That girl sitting next to you shows you her boobs, you're like, ""This day was great!"" || I was at the gym the other day working out with my buddy. My buddy Joey. And he goes ""hey, man, I'm getting a divorce."" I said ""Wow, that sucks. Can you spot me?"" That was our whole conversation! So then I go home to my wife, and I say ""Hey, Joey is getting a divorce."" She goes ""Oh, my God! What happened?"" ""I dunno."" ""What do you mean you don't know? Is she cheating on him, is he cheating on her?"" ""Again, I'm not holding anything back here, I don't know!"" She goes ""Bill, someone tells you they're getting a divorce and you don't ask any questions?"" And I go ""Well, that's because he didn't ask me a question! He didn't say 'hey Bill, what do you think about me getting a divorce?', he said, 'I'm getting a divorce', which said to me, 'I require no further input on your part.'"" If he had said 'What do you think about me getting a divorce?', I'd have said, 'Well, you're gonna be dating again, so you should work on your abs'. || I took Duke to the vet ’cause he eats his own turds, and I asked the vet, “Isn’t that unusual?” and he says, “No, a lot of dogs do that. Just take some of this powder here, sprinkle it on his food and it’ll make him stop.” I said, “What’s it do?” He says, “It makes his turds taste bad.” || “I’m sorry, Doc, did you just say ‘it will make his turds taste bad’?” Let me tell you something, if you’ve stooped to eating turds, you’ve never uttered the phrase, “Oh my God! This is nasty!” || I am out in public and using the phone. I am in a phone booth, got the phone in my hand and a man taps on the glass and says ""You using the phone?"" ""Nope, I'm superman, i am just looking for my costume."" Here's your sign! || My wife was going through my car one night. She said looking for a map. I know it's bogus. 'Cause every time we drive anywhere, she knows exactly where we're going and has no problem telling me how to get there. || Just when I think the human race has been lost to the ""what about me"" people. I see the best we have to offer helping others. || I go ""I just want a cup of black coffee."" She goes ""Do you want to try a biscotti? They're from Italy and they're considered a delicacy."" Have you ever eaten one of these things? It tastes like a burned cookie. Where I'm from, that's considered a mistake. || God was havin’ himself a good day when he made boobs. He must’ve stepped back from Eve and said, ""Yes ma’am! Those’ll work."" || Well, you know the rule: The person who builds it gets to try it first, so my son was at school and I built the trampoline and start to go on it, my wife goes, ""Hey, why don't you wait until he comes home?"" I said, ""Hey, why don't you hush... please?"" Hey, I ain't that big an idiot, all right? So, I was jumping on the trampoline, and I was thinking, ""Oh I remember this."" Started doing seat drops and knee drops and then I got cocky. One thing I learned about a trampoline, if you don't land square, you go up at an angle. And you don't come down at that same angle, you go down at an equal and opposite angle. Yeah, I'm 20 feet in the air and NOW my high school geometry kicks in. I curled into the fetal position, banged against the rail. My wife's laughing so hard, she nearly peed herself. Two important things I learned that day. One, the springs will pull the hair off your legs, and two, the dog doesn't like to jump. || I swear to you, I am the cheapest drunk on the planet. It takes nothing to get me loopy and doing stupid stuff. Yeah. Some of you like that? Well... like riding an electric floor buffer for a shot of tequila. Did it! || My son is 12 now, and is really getting into girls. A lot. But the thing about twelve year old boys is that they don't possess what I like to call that discretionary gene yet. We were walking home from the ballfield the other day and there was a woman walking towards us who was gifted. I saw them, and I saw him see them. But she was too close for me to go, ""Dude, shut up."" She hadn't walked two feet behind us and he goes ""God dang, did you see the size of those things?"" And all I could say was ""Yeah, I did!"" || I think my wife puts up with me ‘cause I try. I think that’s all any guy can do is just try. That’s right! ‘Cause we ain’t never gunna get it. ‘Cause as soon as we get close you ladies change it. It’s like this memo goes out, ‘they’re getting close, change it, change it!’ || I was a dork hunter. That’s hard to do. I fell out of a tree. || We get in the club, and we are totally out of our element. There's this synthesizer-computer music going, there's these laser lights and black lights. It's just not our kind of gig. So we're standing there having a beer and all of sudden my friend goes, 'Hey man, check out that table over there. Those girls'. And there was a table of really young girls. Old enough to be in a bar, but younger than us. And I go 'Yeah'. And he goes 'I think they're checking you out'. I go 'Shut up. They're not checking me out'. Of course, in my head, I'm going 'Hell yeah, they're checking me out! What are you not seeing?'. And he goes 'Nah man, I think they're gonna come over'. I go 'Shut up'. And all of sudden, this one stands up, and she's about 5'10"", smoking hot. She's got a little, tight dress on, cut up to the hip and she has locked eyes on me. And my friend goes 'Dude, you are dead'. And I turned around to talk to them and - this is when you know you have really good friends - they have all taken a step back from me. So now I'm just the turd in the punch bowl. And she is walking right at me and I'm thinking 'Oh my God'. In my head, this whole scenario is going down. I'm thinking 'Just be cool, let her down easy...'. And she walks up to me and says 'Hi'. And I go 'Hi'. She goes 'I'm Bridget'. And I go 'Hi Bridget, I'm fifty. And you're hot'. And I go 'So why don't we do this? Look, before this gets awkward, let me just buy your table a round of drinks, we'll call it a night, and it'll be over'. And she goes 'Okay. But we thought you were Cindy's dad. She's puking in the bathroom so we called him'. || I was always the ""Class Clown"" and over time became very good at it. I started doing comedy on stage at the Dallas Comedy Corner where I honed my skills by watching guys like Garry Shandling, Robin Williams, Jay Lena and more. || I shot me a nice deer, and I hung it on the den wall in my house. My neighbor comes over and he says, ""Did you shoot that thing?"" I said, ""Nope. He ran through the wall and got stuck. Here's your sign."" || The older you get, the more people think they have to listen to you. || While I am venting hey oil companies why does gas cost different in different parts of the country. It's the same freaking gas. || To all companies please stop using Xmas songs and inserting your own lyrics. Write your own music. I am boycotting you until you stop. || I want you to think back to when you were a kid. Remember the day you learned you could burn ants with a magnifying glass? Oh, what a great day that was! You got to be God. You decided who lived, who died. I must've burned ants for an hour, just laughing. Then I saw one on my arm. Let me tell you something, when you burn yourself with a magnifying glass, you're on your own. You can't even tell your mom, because she gives that face, ""Oh, he is that stupid."" || Ladies, you wake up tomorrow and the newspaper reads ""Scientists have discovered a way for men to experience childbirth."" That would be awesome. || See, all this stuff is turning me into this guy I don't want to be: that grouchy old, get-off-my-yard guy. Remember that guy? He was like 'Ah get off my yard! I hate everyone. I hate kids'. It's making me this grouchy guy and I don't want to be it. But I'll give you a great example. The other day, I was in my car and I got stuck behind a school bus. Now, I don't know if you've been stuck behind a school bus before, but once you're there, you're stuck. I've passed kidney stones quicker than you can get around a school bus. || Does your wife ever look at you with a look that if your name wasn't on bills that need to be paid you'd be out the door? || So the hotel tells us that it is not safe to go in the water because its shark mating time. I know how I'd feel if someone interrupted me. || My wife and I had an argument last week that was so stupid, that it bears repeating. My wife collects twist ties... welcome to my world. || As I stand in line at southwest I feel the urge to moo really loud or scream. || I called my pilot 2 weeks before I flew and asked him, ""I don’t want to get sick, what should I eat?"" He said, ""Peanut Butter."" I said, ""If I eat peanut butter then I won’t get sick?"" He said, ""no, but it tastes the same comin’ up as it does goin’ down."" || I'm at the airport, and they lost my luggage, so I go to the lost luggage department. I go up to the girl and say, ""Excuse me, you lost my luggage"", she said, ""Has your plane landed yet"", I said, ""No princess, I'm just having an out of body experience... I'm just checking on It"" There's your sign! || My wife got us a catalog of stuff just for our dogs. 42 pages of things just for our dogs. She bought a feeding dish this high off the ground. I said, “What does he need that for?”, and she says, “So he don’t got to bend his neck to eat!” I just saw him licking his own ass! Excuse me for thinking he’s limber enough to eat! She said, “It helps his digestion!” I said, “His digestion’s just fine! I pick it up out of the yard every morning.” || So I go to this spa, and it was weird. They had pillows all over the floor, Zamfir music playing, water flowing over rocks, supposed to relax you. Made me have to go pee! Then she starts rubbing my butt! Yeah! All I could think was “Don’t fart!” Yeah, you’ve thought about it, haven’t you! ‘Cause when you’re standing up and you’ve got gas, you can clench it in. When someone’s rubbing your butt cheeks east and west, you’re bound to let one of those icky dog farts squirt out. || I'm at the register in the clothing store, and i put a pair of pants on the counter. The lady says ""You Gonna Buy Those"" I said ""Nope gonna steal them, just wanna let you see them before I do"" Here's your sign! || I stayed back late at work one afternoon last week and I had a co-worker looked at me and said ""are you still here?"" I said no, I left 10 minutes ago. Here's your sign !!  || It's like before my wife and I moved. Our house was full of boxes and there was a U-Haul truck in our driveway. My friend comes over and says ""Hey, you moving?"" ""Nope. We just pack our stuff up once or twice a week to see how many boxes it takes. Here's your sign."" || She sits down across the table from me, and didn't say ""Hi, hello, my name is..."" She just said ""this is what I'm going to tell my husband when he gets home from work today. I'm going to tell him that I had lunch with Jeff Foxworthy."" || My wife goes ""that's not a bicycle, Rembrandt!"" And I go ""well, it ain't a monkey wearing glasses, Helen Keller!"" || Now, I tell you that for two reasons. One, to brag. And two, to tell you she wants to retake the test. I go, ""what are you, stupid?"" I wish my SAT scores had four digits in it! That equal 13. || Greed is a bad color on a person. || I never say never. Who knows? I’d welcome it. || I pulled the boy close to me and said you see that girl, that's my only lil' girl. So if you think about huggin' or kissin'. Remember these words. I ain't afraid to go back to prison.  || I hit two trees and fell down a ditch. And that was just walking from the lodge. || If I ever find out who told my son this, I will kill them. Apparently, somebody told my son there’s a wiener thief out there, and if he takes his hand off it, Wssh! They’re gonna snatch it away! || I just hate stupid people. They should have to wear signs that say ""I'm Stupid"". That way you wouldn't rely on them, and you wouldn't ask them for nothing. || My wife, trying to be helpful, goes to the grocery store and buys this stuff called soy bacon. Let me tell you something: I know soy beans are good for a lot of things. Let's stay out of the bacon market! It says ""It looks and tastes like real bacon!"" No it doesn't! It tastes like somebody bacon-flavored a turd, that's what it tastes like! || You can’t tell somebody to kiss your ass on a scooter! || We were in the park flying a kite and a guy walks up and says ""You flying a kite?"" ""Nope, we're fishing for birds."" Here's your sign! || I was sitting on a plane that is traveling towards Seattle. And the guy next to me turns and says to me ""Hey, you going to Seattle?"". ""Nope, San Francisco... I'll be parachuting off in about an hour."" Here's your sign! || I called my wife up on the cell phone and said baby you aint gonna believe this, I go, we just hit a deer with the airplane. and there was a silence on the other end of the line followed by...Oh m God! Were you on the ground? I said ""Nope, Santa was making one last run..."" || You could take Vicodin, step out of the house, onto a freeway, have a truck hit you, and you'd say ""My bad!"". || Welcome to my garage! This is where I go to get away from the honey-do list. || This year, I was cool for 2 seconds of my life. I got to fly with the Airforce Thunderbirds. They called me out of the blue, and said ""How would you like to fly with us?"" And I'm like ""You got the right number?"" ""Yeah, Bill Engvall, you stand for what America stands for. Be an honor to have you fly with us."" And I'm like ""I'd be an honor to fly iwth 'ya."" ""Well, we gotta get you clearance from the Pentagon."" I went ""Well, I'm screwed."" || She's online with her friends, and little boys are starting to call the house. Oh, my God, we had a kid call the house at two in the morning. Oh, I lost it. 'Cause first of all, I'm off in La-la land with Shania Twain in the mountains somewhere. I hear a phone ring and I'm like ""Who's got a phone in the mountains?"" So when I realize it's my phone, I'm already a little miffed, so I go, ""Hello!"" And this little voice says ""Uh... is Emily there?"" And I go, ""Dude, if you have a brain in your skull, you will hang this phone up right now!"" Click. Then my wife turns to me and goes, ""Bill, you've got to be nice."" And I go, ""No, ma'am. ""Nice"" stops at midnight!"" || Y'all, I am screaming at my television set: they're spitting cobras, you moron! || I was watching one of those animal shows on the Discovery Channel. There was a guy inventing a shark bite suit. And there's only one way to test it. ""All right Jimmy, you got that shark suit on, it looks good... They want you to jump into this pool of sharks, and you tell us if it hurts when they bite you."" ""Well, all right, but hold my sign. I don't wanna lose it."" || There was a girl who was cooking a cake for her family for the first time and the directions said ""Grease the bottom of the pan."" So, she greased the bottom of the pan... You think there was a house fire? Here's your sign! || I woke up one morning, got dressed, and my wife asked me, “Where you going?”, I said, “I’ve got my yearly physical today.” “I’ll go with you!” OK, how boring is your day? I’d never go with her to her physical! Seen it! It’s not like we’d be breaking any new ground! It’s not like I’d go, “Hey Doc, what’s that?” || I was born in Galveston, Texas in 1957 in the middle of a hurricane. I guess because of the drop in the barometric pressure it affected my brain and I was destined to become a stand up comic, although at that age I wasn't aware of my destiny. || I'm in my fifties now, which is a cool age. I love being in my fifties because people gotta listen to you now; you've been around for awhile. Now, the other side of that coin is that - cause you're in your fifties - you still care what people think about you. So you kind of filter what you say. Now if that's the case, I can't wait until I'm eighty. Because eighty-year-old people don't give a damn what you think. Think about it: how many eighty-year-old people with any tact at all do you know? None! 'Cause they don't have to! They're eighty! Does Grandma hold her farts in at the dinner table? No! She doesn't have to. She's earned the right to fart at your dinner table. She'll fart at the pearly gates on her way to meet sweet Jesus. || Then we got my dog, Duke, he’s a basset hound. Duke’s the perfect dog, yeah! He eats his own turds! Perfect dog right there. Goes outside to poop, cleans it right up! You can’t teach that. That’s just a gift. Best part is, my wife doesn’t know he does it. She loves to let that dog lick her face! That’s why we never have an argument. She starts climbing on top of me, and I’m like, “Duke! Mama needs some lovin’!” || I might have tried bungee jumping, until I saw that video of that guy whose cord came untied. He didn't know it 'till he hit the ground. Oh, he flew off that tower, hollering at his buddies. ""Whoo, check me out, dudes! Oh, that ground is coming up..."" WHAM! And what do you say, if you're the operator of that ride, to the next guy in line? ""All right dude, you're up."" || My uncle Jack. We are at the funeral, and we weren’t even outside. We were in the church! And the reverend had just finished his eulogy, when we heard, “Psshhh!” And everyone turned to uncle Jack, who was holding a beer, going, “What?” || Can someone explain to me why pilots feel they need to wake everyone to tell us that we are flying by a cloud that looks like a monkey. || A lady goes into a bar and orders a beer. So, she sits there and drinks it for a while. Well, a man comes in a few minutes later and liked to buy the lady another drink. He asks her, ""Is that a beer you're drinking?"" She's like, ""No, it must be pee I'm drinking because it's a yellowish color."" Duh!! Here's your sign. || We were trying to sell our car about a year ago. A guy came over to the house and drove the car around for about 45 minutes. We get back to the house, he gets out of the car, reaches down and grabs the exhaust pipe, then goes, ""Darn that's hot!"" See? If he'd been wearing his sign, I could have stopped him. || I come in the house soaking wet and am greeted by ""Is it raining?"" ""Nope, decided to take the fish for a walk"". Here's your sign! || I pull up at the Christmas tree shop and I walk up and the guy says ""hey you here to buy a tree?"" ""Nope, My son had to go to the bathroom and these trees looked mighty inviting."" Here's your sign! || I'm going to pull him in tight next to me so only he and I can hear the conversation. And I'm gonna say to him, ""Boy, look at me. You see that little girl right there? She's my only little girl, man. She's my life. So if you have any thoughts about huggin', or kissin', you remember these words: 'I've got no problem going back to prison.'"" || I'm not going to get to pick the restaurant. Because I'm going to go ""where do you want to eat?"", and she's going to go ""I don't care."" So I'll say, ""okay, how about Italian?"" ""Hmmmm..."" I'm not going to get to pick the movie, and there's a real good chance I'm not going to get lucky! That's not a date! || When you're doing stand-up, you achieve an intimacy with the audience you can't get on TV. There's not a better feeling in the entire world then when you look out and see the audience is identifying with you. || I've come up with the three things you never want to hear at your kid's parent/teacher conference. Number one: ""You're only responsible for the first $10,000 worth of damage."" Number two: ""We have medication for this."" And number three: ""It was more than an ounce and he was less than a hundred yards from the school."" || I believe that the way to a man’s heart is not through his stomach. It’s a little further south. || We could walk into a Chinese restaurant right here in Chicago. And the waiter could have been born here, raised here, went to college here, he has never left the city limits. I'm the idiot that walks in that restaurant and goes [in exaggerated Chinese] ""Uh, yes. I'll have fried rice. Egg roll..."" And you can see him go ""I am so going to spit in your food, I swear to God."" And it drives my daughter crazy. 'Cause she goes ""why do you do that? That is so insulting to them!"" || This guy from L. A. sits down next to me, and he says ""you like baseball?"" I said, ""Oh, man, I love baseball."" So he goes ""Did you know that if Jesus had played ball, he'd have been the greatest ball player ever?"" Like I'm gonna argue with that logic. So I sat there for a second, and then I said ""did you know that if Babe Ruth had been the Messiah, the Catholics would have beer and hot dogs at Communion?"" He left. || We get a magazine called Modern Ferret. It's a magazine about that hairy rat, I swear to God! And if you ever see it, pick it up. And on the inside cover, it's a woman and the man who publish this magazine wrote this inscription: ""some day, we hope to make money doing what we love, playing with our ferret."" Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Pee-Wee Herman lose a lot of money playing with his ferret? || And don't put a rose in my hand. Put a slim-jim in it. Send me to heaven with a slim-jim! || I arrived home the other day, and it was just pouring rain out side so buy the time I get from the car to the front door I am soaked. I walk in side and take off my jacket and my wife says ""Is it raining out"" I couldn’t help my self when I replied ""Nope, I had to take the gold fish for a walk. Here's your sign!"" || How about this, have you ever farted so hard you shivered? || Yeah, let me give it a shot! The other, a few weeks ago my car broke down on the road. I had it pulled over to the side, and there’s just smoke pouring out of the motor. A guy stops to see if I’m all right, but he asks the stupid question. He said, “Car break down?” I said, “Nah, car wanted a cigarette, so I pulled over!” Here’s your sign! || There was a ship out in the ocean, and the guy up in the crow’s nest says, “Enemy ship ahead!” The captain says, “Bring me my red shirt.” And the servant says, “Uh... okay.” So he gets the captains red shirt, and the captain puts it on. And as the battle proceeded, they didn’t loose one sailor. At the end of the battle, the servant comes up and says, “Before the battle, you said to bring you your red shirt. Why your red shirt?” And the captain says, “Because, if I happen to be shot, and started bleeding, the sailors wouldn’t see the blood and would continue to fight on!” The sailor said, “Oh! That’s brilliant, right there!” The next morning, the guy in the crow’s nest yells, “20 enemy ships ahead!” The captain then said, “Bring me my brown pants!” || You can’t climb a tile wall. || We bought a piece of stereo equipment, you know inside the box they put that little package of drying agent. And on this in big bold letters, what does it say? ‘Do not eat this’. You ever bought a piece of stereo equipment thinkin’ there might be somethin’ to eat in there? || One day I locked my keys in my car and as I was standing there with a hanger halfway through the top of my window, a guy walks up and says,"" Lock yer keys in the car?"" Without missin' a beat I said, ""Nope, Just washed it and was hanging it up to dry."" Here's your sign. || He knows all the golf lingo. You know? You hit your ball, he's like ""there's a golf shot. That's a golf shot."" Well of course it's a golf shot; I just hit a golf ball. You don't see Gretzky skating around going ""there's a hockey shot, that's a hockey shot."" || You know your getting older when you lay in bed til 10am and think to yourself ""god I just wasted half the day"". || I just realized that with the invention of the iPhone and others you now get to see the top of people's heads. || I'm in high school, and I was walking to my 6th period class the other day. When I get there being the first one there I pull on the door to find it locked. The drapes are closed, so I can't see if anyone is inside, so just to be sure, I start pounding on the door. At that moment the principle walks by the classroom with keys and says ""are you locked out?"" I said ""nope,the door made fun of my mom, I was just giving him a beating for it. Here's your sign."" || Anybody who's ever tried to quit smoking knows exactly what I'm talking about. It is the hardest thing you will ever do in your life. And people who have never smoked just don't get that. It's like, my wife goes ""I don't understand why you just don't quit, Bill. Just put them down and quit."" I go, ""Baby, I am trying. It is hard."" And she goes, ""I'm sorry, Bill. I don't understand why you just don't quit."" And I go, ""all right. Why don't you quit yelling?"" 'Cause you can't. || A couple of months ago I went fishing with a buddy of mine, we pulled his boat into the dock, I lifted up this big 'ol stringer of bass and this idiot on the dock goes, ""Hey, y'all catch all them fish?"" ""Nope - Talked 'em into giving up. Here's your sign."" || Because we've become so ecologically minded now, they have developed a product called ""Rapidly Dissolving Toilet Paper."" Just how ""rapidly"" are we talking? 'Cause I don't want to have to play ""Beat the Clock"" in the thicket. || I've about decided if it wasn't for the sex, I could be gay. Hell, then you're just hangin' out with your buddies. || Remember chin-up bars in elementary school? Yeah, so do I. Fourth grade, me and my buddy got this idea, we would run our Stingray bikes through the chin-up bar, when we got to the bar, we would the grab the bar and let our bikes go and just swing there. ‘Cause we’re idiots. One day we were out on the playground, it had been raining. We didn’t think metal got slick when it got wet. Never had cause to think that thought. We’re straddling our bikes, trying to look cool, and I see these two little fifth grade girls by the swings. I turned to my buddy and said, “Hey man, older women.” “I’ll go first.” Boy, I spun that knobby tire in the mud, I’m flying towards that chin-up bar, the banana seat’s getting hot just from the wind blowing by it! I grabbed that wet pole, I let that bike go, my full wait hit the chin-up bar, I went, “Thunk!” Knocked out cold on the ground. My friend flips out. He runs across the street to my house where my mom’s in bed sick with the flu, runs into her bedroom and screams, “Bill’s dead!” About the time I came too, I saw a woman in her nightgown and panties run at me going, “Waaaaaa!” Boy I wish I had died! || Can’t have sausage anymore, and not because of health reasons, but because I saw a commercial that nearly scared me to death. I was watching TV one night, and this is what the commercial said word for word. “The eggs are from real chickens. The milk is from real cows. But the sausage is from Jimmy Dean.” Really? You’d think someone would have caught that! || For about two weeks after that, my wife and I would be sitting at the breakfast table and there would be two or three coyotes sitting watching the back yard. And you’d know the conversation went something like this: “Naw, hell no, don’t go in there, that little dog’s a setup.” “I ain’t lyin’, ask Joe what happened to him!” || A truck driver was driving along on the freeway. A sign comes up that reads, ""Low Bridge Ahead."" Before he knows it, the bridge is right ahead of him and he gets stuck under the bridge. Cars are backed up for miles. Finally a police car comes up. The cop gets out of his car and walks to the truck driver, puts his hands on his hips and says, ""Got stuck, huh?"" The truck driver says, ""No, I was delivering this bridge and ran out of gas.""  || Last time I had a flat tire, I pulled my truck into one of those side-of-the-road gas stations. The attendant walks out, looks at my truck, looks at me, and I swear he said, ""Tire go flat?"" I couldn't resist. Said, ""Nope. I was driving around and those other three just swelled right up on me. Here's your sign."" || I discovered two very important facts that day - Number one: The springs will pull the hair out of your legs, and Number two: the dog doesn't like to bounce. || Ever set your hair on fire? Me too! And not the hair on my head. Oh, shall we not go to the gutter so quickly? It was the hair on my arms. I want you to think back to when you were a kid. Remember the day you learned you could burn ants with a magnifying glass? Oh, what a great day that was! You got to be God. You decided who lived, who died. I must've burned ants for an hour, just laughing. Then I saw one on my arm. Let me tell you something, when you burn yourself with a magnifying glass, you're on your own. You can't even tell your mom, because she gives that face, ""Oh, he is that stupid."" || God, she's growing up, and I don't know when it happened, man. I used to buy her Minnie Mouse panties and little Winnie the Pooh underwear. I was helping my wife fold cloths. I picked up a pair of skimpy underwear. I looked at my wife and said: ""When you gonna wear these for me?"" She goes, ""I can't. They're your daughter's."" ""Aaahh! No, no, no!"" There was nothing to them! The how-to-wash tag was the biggest piece of cloth on there. || There's a group in California that wants to make suicide a capital offense punishable by death. That's like punishing someone for being on a hunger strike by sending them to bed with no supper. || He can procrastinate more than any kid I've ever met in my life. When I tell my son to go take a shower, it can easily be forty-five minutes before I hear the water start running. Do you got one like this? He gets up in his bathroom, 'cause he has go to the bathroom again. And I don't even think he has to go; I think he just enjoys the comfort of that seat. It's like his La-Z-Boy rocker. He's got books in front of it, and LEGOs. And one night, I told him to go take a shower, and I didn't hear the water run for about an hour, and I said ""that is it!"" And I went upstairs and I walked in his room, and I heard this ""boom, boom, boom."" And I looked around the corner of the bathroom, he is standing butt naked in front of the mirror going ""shake your boom boom, shake your boom boom."" And I let it go for about ten seconds, then went ""Shake, boy!"" We don't nekkid dance anymore. || Went to the grocery store, got everything on my list and went up to the checkout. I put a bag of pet food for our rabbit on the conveyor. The girl looked at me and said, ""Do you have a rabbit?"" I looked at here and said deadpan, ""Nope. Just like 'em 'cause they're crunchy. Here's your sign."" || Did you ever notice all the items on a honey do list are dangerous. Clean gutters, put light in shower, patch roof. It's a honey die list. || I'd love to be a woman for one day of my life... God... I would be drunk with power. || So finally, on about the fifteenth tee, I hit the drive of my life. And any of you people who play golf, you know the drive I'm talking about. The minute you hit it, you just drop your club. You hang on to the beer, let's don't get stupid. And I watch this ball just go and go and kind of hit this guy in the head. And I felt bad, but he overreacted, I thought. I mean, it wasn't like a square hit; it just kind of glanced off his head. But he goes whippin' his car off the freeway, like ""here we go!"" Mr. Attitude! So now, he's barreling down the fairway screaming at the top of his lungs, like ""what are you, some kind of cruddy golfer?"" I'm like, ""hey, I hit you, didn't I? You were traveling sixty-five miles an hour. That's a pretty good shot in my book."" || If your mother still drives you to school, you are not a gangster, pull your pants up! || I believe that the phrase “time in a bottle” refers to the amount of beer you can drink before last call. || She said, “Well, what are you gonna do when these little boys start coming over to the house?” I said, “Oh, I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna pull the young man in tight next to me so only he and I can hear the conversation. I’m gonna whisper in his ear and I’m gonna say, ‘Boy, look at me. You see that little girl there? That’s my only little girl, man. She’s my life. So if you have any thoughts about hugging or kissing, you remember these words: I got no problem going back to prison.’ || I relieve my stress by buying stuff. I'll go to Bass Pro Shops and here's the problem: I'm an impulse buyer. I'll like ""Oh, look. I bought a deer feeder."" Then I'll think ""Oh, man. I gotta get it home."" And that drives my wife crazy. 'Cause she's very much a list shopper. Like, she hates it when I get on airplanes. Because the airlines now have this magazine called SkyMall magazine. Oh, that is my crack. I know it's just crap. But it's crap I've gotta have. She got really mad at me when I ordered a digital fly swatter out of that magazine. Well, come on! It keeps track of swats, hits and kills. And the best part is, you could hook it to the internet, and you could see where you rank nationally as a fly swatter. || We’ve got 4 dogs, 2 of them are wiener dogs, those are her dogs. And they’re cute until they have to go to the vet, and then it’s like a billion dollars. I took them to the vet and our idiot vet goes, “That dog’s gonna have back problems right there.” No kidding! It’s got an 8-foot back and 2-inch legs! I could have figured that one out! Here’s another one, Doc Obvious. That right there’s a boy dog and he’s 1/4 inch away from dragging his transmission on the sidewalk! || When I die, I don’t want people to look in my coffin and go, “Wow, he looks great.” I’m dead for Christ’s sake! I want people to walk by my coffin and go, “Jesus! He partied…” And for the love of God, don’t put a rose in my hand, put a Slim Jim. Send me to heaven with a Slim Jim!"
Bill Hicks,"Oh sorry, I was taking life seriously. || People ask me what I think about that woman priest thing. What, a woman priest? Women priests. Great, great. Now there's priests of both sexes I don't listen to. || Then comes the kicker: Say the alphabet – backwards. ""Well, shit, you got me. I'm not drunk, but I'm obviously too stupid to be driving, God damn it."" || People say to me, “Oh, Bill, leave them alone. They’re so good, and so clean-cut, and they’re such a good image for the children.” Fuck that! When did mediocrity and banality become a good image for your children? I want my children listening to people who fucking rocked! I don’t care if they died in pools of their own vomit! I want someone who plays from his fucking heart! “Mommy, the man Bill told me to listen to has a blood bubble on his nose.” Shut up and listen to him play! || They're putting the cart before the horse on this pornography issue. Playboy doesn't cause sexual thoughts. There are sexual thoughts, and, therefore, there is Playboy. Don't you see? I know these sound like deep philosophical questions, ""What came first, the hard-on or the Madonna video?"" and ""If a hard-on falls in the forest, do you go blind?"" and ""What does an atheist scream when they come?"" || I deal only in facts, that's why I'm a cocky fucking bastard. || By the way, if anyone here is in advertising or marketing, kill yourself. No really, there's no rationalisation for what you do, and you are Satan's little helpers, OK? Kill yourselves, seriously. || You watch the news these days? It's unbelievable. You think you just walk out your door, you're immediately gonna be raped by some crack-addicted, AIDS-infected pitbull. || Eternal suffering awaits anyone who questions god's infinite love. || It is hard to quit smoking. Every one of them looks real good to me right about now. Every cigarette looks like it was made by God, rolled by Jesus and moistened shut with Claudia Schiffer's pussy. || When did sex become a bad thing? Did I miss a meeting? || ""I believe that the Bible is the literal word of God."" And I say no, it's not, Dad. ""Well, I believe that it is."" Well, you know, some people believe they're Napoleon. That's fine. Beliefs are neat. Cherish them, but don't share them like they're the truth. || You know we armed Iraq. I wondered about that too, you know during the Persian Gulf war those intelligence reports would come out: ""Iraq: incredible weapons - incredible weapons."" How do you know that? ""Uh, well... we looked at the receipts."" || I ascribe to Mark Twain's theory that the last person who should be President is the one who wants it the most. The one who should be picked is the one who should be dragged kicking and screaming into the White House. || I guess what surprised me the most was the discrepancy in casualties: Iraq, one hundred fifty thousand casualties, USA...seventy-nine! Let's go over those numbers again, they're a little baffling at first. Iraq, 150,000, USA 79. Does that mean we could have won with only 80 guys there? Just one guy in a ticker-tape parade, ""I did it! Hey!"" || The musicians today who don't do drugs and in fact speak out against it? ""Rock Against Drugs?"" BOY do they suck. || Where have I been? I've been on my flying saucer tour. Which means like flying saucers I too have been appearing in small southern towns in front of a handful of hillbillies lately... no one doubts my existence. || Lots of Christians wear crosses around their necks… You really think when Jesus comes back, he ever wants to see a fucking cross? || I was in Nashville, Tennessee last year. After the show I went to a Waffle House. I'm not proud of it, I was hungry. And I'm alone, I'm eating and I'm reading a book, right? Waitress walks over to me: 'Hey, whatcha readin' for?' Isn't that the weirdest fucking question you've ever heard? Not what am I reading, but what am I reading for? Well, goddamnit, ya stumped me! Why do I read? Well... hmmm... I dunno... I guess I read for a lot of reasons and the main one is so I don't end up being a fucking waffle waitress. || I love when people in New York City complain about your smoking. Isn't that great? Yeah. These people are standing ankle-deep in dog links, straddling a dead guy, you know. Apparently my cigarette's fucking up the delicate balance of nature here. || You believe the world's 12 thousand years old? ""That's right."" Okay I got one word to ask you, a one word question, ready? ""Uh huh."" Dinosaurs. You know the world's 12 thousand years old and dinosaurs existed, they existed in that time, you'd think it would have been mentioned in the fucking Bible at some point. || We are the facilitators of our own creative evolution. || Childbirth is no more a miracle then eating food and a turd coming out of your ass. || You ever noticed how people who believe in Creationism look really unevolved? You ever noticed that? Eyes real close together, eyebrow ridges, big furry hands and feet. ""I believe God created me in one day."" Yeah, looks liked He rushed it. || Let me tell you about gays in the military. I don't want any gay people hanging around me while I'm killing kids. I just don't want to see it. || I'm very tired of staring out into your vacant faces looking back at me. Wanting to fill your empty lives with humor you couldn't possibly think of yourself... Good evening! || Why don't families take mushrooms and stay home, and trip together? || I'll smoke, I'll cough, I'll get the tumors, I'll die, deal? Thank you America. || We all pay for life with death, so everything in between should be free. || The worst kind of non-smokers are the ones that come up to you and cough. That's pretty fucking cruel isn't it? Do you go up to cripples and dance too? || If the FBI's motivating factor for busting down the Koresh compound was child abuse, how come we never see Bradley tanks smashing into Catholic churches? || I love the Pope, I love seeing him in his Pope-Mobile, his three feet of bullet proof plexi-glass. That's faith in action folks! You know he's got God on his side. || One of my big fears in life is that I'm gonna die and my parents are going to come to clean out my apartment and find that porno wing I've been adding on to for years. || I just have one of those faces. People come up to me and say, ""What's wrong?"" Nothing. ""Well, it takes more energy to frown than it does to smile."" Yeah, you know it takes more energy to point that out than it does to leave me alone? || They proved that if you quit smoking, it will prolong your life. What they haven't proved is that a prolonged life is a good thing. I haven't seen the stats on that yet. || People tell me, 'Bill, let it go. The Kennedy assassination was years ago. It was just the assassination of a President and the hijacking of our government by a totalitarian regime — who cares? Just let it go.' I say, 'All right then. That whole Jesus thing? Let it go! It was 2,000 years ago! Who cares?' || See I don't drink, I smoke. I used to drink, I did, I had to quit. Man, I was an embarrassing drunk. I'd get pulled over by the cops, I'd be so drunk I'd be out dancing to their lights thinking I'd made it to another club. Hey what is this, a leather bar? Hey I'm not into this, you faggots, oh SHIT! || I can't watch TV longer than five minutes without praying for nuclear holocaust. || It's great to be here. I thank you. Ah, I've been on the road doing comedy for ten years now, so bear with me while I plaster on a fake smile and plough through this shit one more time. || I don't do drugs anymore... than say, the average touring funk band. || I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit. || I loved when Bush came out and said, ""We are losing the war against drugs."" You know what that implies? There's a war being fought, and the people on drugs are winning it. || I was told when I grew up I could be anything I wanted: a fireman, a policeman, a doctor - even president, it seemed. And for the first time in the history of mankind, something new, called an astronaut. But like so many kids brought up on a steady diet of westerns, I always wanted to be the avenging cowboy hero - that lone voice in the wilderness, fighting corruption and evil wherever I fount it, and standing for freedom, truth, and justice. And in my heart of hearts I still track the remnants of that dream wherever I go, in my endless ride into the setting sun. || I don't mean to sound bitter, cold, or cruel, but I am, so that's how it comes out. || Your denial is beneath you, and thanks to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, I see through you. || I smoke to fill the potholes in my soul. || I'm glad mushrooms are against the law, because I took them one time, and you know what happened to me? I laid in a field of green grass for four hours going, ""My God! I love everything."" Yeah, now if that isn't a hazard to our country … how are we gonna justify arms dealing when we realize that we're all one? || It's really weird how your life changes. Tonight I'm drinking water. Four years ago? Opium. Night and day, you know? || As long as one person lives in darkness then it seems to be a responsibility to tell other people. || Music is a great energizer. It's a language everybody knows. || I'm not a girl, I'm a guy you know? But at the same time, I tell ya how you can solve this abortion issue right now. Ready? Those unwanted babies that single moms leave in alleys and in dumpsters? Leave about 12 of those on the steps of The Supreme Court. This is over. Like that. ""You guys said we had to have them? Then you guys... fucking raise 'em."" ""Raise 'em then, you fucking fucking raise 'em. You raise 'em. You said I had to have it? Then it's yours. Fuck. It's yours... Take it."" || This needs to be said: there never was a war. ""How can you say that, Bill?"" Well, a war is when two armies are fighting. So you can see, right there, there never was a war... || People say ""Iraq had the fourth largest army in the world"". Yeah, maybe, but you know what, after the first 3 largest armies, there's a real big fucking drop-off. The Hare Krishnas are the 5th largest army in the world, and they've already got all our airports. || Did you know that if you play the New Kids On The Block record backwards, it actually sounds better. || I don't get along with anything, I really don't. I'm just - I'm, I'm, maybe I'm just a, you know, incredibly tasteful human being. || I was in a cab in New York. The cab had a sign, ""Please do not smoke, Christ is our unseen guest."" This guy was reaching. I figure, if he could overcome being nailed to a cross, I don't think a Marlboro Light's gonna faze him that much. || I have something to tell you non-smokers that I know for a fact that you don't know, and I feel it's my duty to pass on information at all times. Ready? Non-smokers die every day... Enjoy your evening. See, I know that you entertain this eternal life fantasy because you've chosen not to smoke, but let me be the 1st to POP that bubble and bring you hurling back to reality... You're dead too. || Why is marijuana against the law? It grows naturally upon our planet. Doesn’t the idea of making nature against the law seem to you a bit... unnatural? || Not all drugs are good, all right? Some of them... are great. Just gotta know your way around them, is all. || Here is my final point. About drugs, about alcohol, about pornography and smoking and everything else. What business is it of yours what I do, read, buy, see, say, think, who I fuck, what I take into my body - as long as I do not harm another human being on this planet? || I never got along with my dad. Kids used to come up to me and say, ""My dad can beat up your dad."" I'd say Yeah? When? || We gotta come to some new ideas about life folks ok? I'm not being blase about abortion, it might be a real issue, it might not, doesn't matter to me. What matters is that if you believe in the sanctity of life then you believe it for life of all ages. That's what I hate about this child-worship syndrome going on. ""Save the children! They're killing children! How many children were at Waco? They're killing children!"" What does that mean? They reach a certain age and they're off your fucking love-list? Fuck your children, if that's the way you think then fuck you too. You either love all people of all ages or you shut the fuck up. || The definition of black irony is Pro-lifers killing Doctors who do abortions. || Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves. || It's always funny until someone gets hurt. Then it's just hilarious. || Why is pot against the law? It wouldn't be because anyone can grow it, and therefore you can't make a profit off it, would it? || I smoke. If this bothers anyone, I suggest you look around at the world in which we live and shut your fucking mouth. || If you're so pro-life, do me a favour: don't lock arms and block medical clinics. If you're so pro-life, lock arms and block cemeteries. || And if I can take part in it by transforming my own consciousness, then someone else's, I'm happy to do it. || It's just a ride and we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money, a choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. || I've had good times on drugs, that's a fact. I've had bad times on drugs, too, ok? But I've had good and bad relationships... and I'm not giving up pussy. || How about a positive LSD story? Wouldn't that be news-worthy, just the once? To base your decision on information rather than scare tactics and superstition and lies? I think it would be news-worthy. || I find it ironic that people who are against things that cause sexual thoughts are generally fundamentalist Christians who also believe you should be fruitful and multiply. || People say, ""Uh-Uh, Bill, Iraq had the fourth-largest army in the world."" Yeah, well, maybe, but, you know what? After the first three largest armies there's a really big fucking drop-off, okay? The Hare Krishnas are the fifth largest army in the world, and they've already got all our airports. So, who is the bigger threat? || God help me. I'm so tired. I need my sleep. I make no bones about it. I need eight hours a day, and at least ten at night... || Supreme Court says pornography is anything without artistic merit that causes sexual thoughts, that's their definition, essentially. No artistic merit, causes sexual thoughts. Hmm... Sounds like... every commercial on television, doesn't it? You know, when I see those two twins on that Doublemint commercial? I'm not thinking of gum. I am thinking of chewing, so maybe that's the connection they're trying to make. || We live in a world where John Lennon was murdered, yet Barry Manilow continues to put out fucking albums. God-dammit! If you're gonna kill somebody, have some fucking taste. I'll drive you to Kenny Rogers' house. || I saw a sign on the side of the road in Tennessee once that said 'dirt for sale'...what a great country we live in. Dirt for sale. How would you like to get inside that guys mind and look around for a hour? That guy sees opportunity at every glance, doesn't he? It's a big world for this gentleman. 'Oh my god, honey! Honey quit servin' waffles and come here baby. I'm gunna sell dirt! Look it's everywhere. You need it for our planet, honey!' The place was called Land Land. || People say to me, ""Hey, Bill, the war made us feel better about ourselves."" Really? What kind of people are these with such low self-esteem that they need a war to feel better about themselves? May I suggest, instead of a war to feel better about yourself, perhaps… sit-ups? Maybe a fruit cup? Eight glasses of water a day? || Remember this shit, if you play certain rock albums backwards there'd be satanic messages? Let me tell you something, if you're sitting round your house playing your albums backwards, you are Satan. You needn't look any further. And don't go ruining my stereo to prove a point either. || I can speak for every guy in this room here tonight. Guys, if you could blow yourselves, ladies, you'd be in this room alone right now. Watching an empty stage. || They tell us ""Rock'n'roll is the devil's music."" Well, let's say we know that rock is the devil's music, and we know that it is, for sure … At least he fucking jams! If it's a choice between eternal Hell and good tunes, and eternal Heaven and New Kids on the fucking Block … I'm gonna be surfin' on the lake of fire, rockin' out. || What I do, and I know all smokers do this. You know how every cigarette pack has a different surgeon general's warning on it, how cool. Mine say, ""Smoking may cause fetal injury or premature birth."" ...fuck it. I found my brand. Just don't get the ones that say, ""Lung Cancer,"" ya know, shop around. Hell gimme a carton of them Low Birth Weights. What the fuck do I care? 'Why you so down Bill?' Low Birth Weight. Yeah, I'm smokin' way too many Low Birth Weights. || I can't believe a war against drugs when they have anti-drug commercials on TV all day long followed by ""This Bud is for you."" || I'm Bill Hicks, and I'm dead now, 'cause I smoked cigarrettes... cigarrettes didn't kill me, a bucnh of non-smokers kicked the living shit out of me one night. || No, I don't do drugs anymore, either. But I'll tell you something about drugs. I used to do drugs, but I'll tell you something honestly about drugs, honestly, and I know it's not a very popular idea, you don't hear it very often anymore, but it is the truth: I had a great time doing drugs. Sorry. Never murdered anyone, never robbed anyone, never raped anyone, never beat anyone, never lost a job, a car, a house, a wife or kids, laughed my ass off, and went about my day. || Dinosaur fossils? ""God put those there to test our faith."" Thank God I'm strapped in right now here man. I think God put you here to test my faith, Dude. You believe that? ""Uh huh."" Does that trouble anyone here? The idea that God... might be... fuckin' with our heads? I have trouble sleeping with that knowledge. Some prankster God running around: ""Hu hu ho. We will see who believes in me now, ha HA."" || This is where we are at right now, as a whole. No one is left out of the loop. We are experiencing a reality based on a thin veneer of lies and illusions. A world where greed is our God and wisdom is sin, where division is key and unity is fantasy, where the ego-driven cleverness of the mind is praised, rather than the intelligence of the heart. || I believe that there is an equality to all humanity: We all suck. || The Beatles were so high they let Ringo sing a couple of tunes. || I believe everyone has this fuckin' poem in his heart. || Go back to bed, America. Your government has figured out how it all transpired. Go back to bed, America. Your government is in control again. Here. Here's American Gladiators. Watch this, shut up. Go back to bed, America. Here is American Gladiators. Here is 56 channels of it! Watch these pituitary retards bang their fucking skulls together and congratulate you on living in the land of freedom. Here you go, America! You are free to do what we tell you! You are free to do what we tell you! || I'm gonna share with you a vision that I had, cause I love you. And you feel it. You know all that money we spend on nuclear weapons and defense each year, trillions of dollars, correct? Instead - just play with this - if we spent that money feeding and clothing the poor of the world - and it would pay for it many times over, not one human being excluded - we can explore space together, both inner and outer, forever in peace. Thank you very much. You've been great, I hope you enjoyed it. || I'm a heavy smoker. I go through two lighters a day. || Now, I'm no bleeding heart, OK? But... when you're walking down the streets of New York City and you're stepping over a guy on the sidewalk who, I don't know, might be dead... Does it ever occur to you to think, ""Wow. Maybe our system doesn't work?"" || All governments are lying cocksuckers. || It's all about money, not freedom, ya'll, okay? Nothing to do with fucking freedom. If you think you're free, try going somewhere without fucking money, okay? || Do a commercial, you're off the artistic roll call, every word you say is suspect, you're a corporate whore and eh, end of story. || I'll show you politics in America. Here it is, right here. ""I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs."" ""I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking."" Hey, wait a minute, there's one guy holding out both puppets! || It seems to me that there will be a point in out development or our evolution where you put your guns aside. || My voice was not heard, the questions were not asked that I wanted to see asked. || I'll tell you, too, that's starting to depress me about UFO's, about the fact that they cross galaxies, or wherever they come from to visit us, and always end up in places like Fife, Alabama. Maybe these are not super-intelligent beings, man. || If you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, then go home and burn all your records, all your tapes, and all your CDs because every one of those artists who have made brilliant music and enhanced your lives? Real fucking high on drugs. The Beatles were so fucking high they let Ringo sing a few songs. || Children are smarter than any of us. Know how I know that? I don't know one child with a full time job and children. || People tell me ""hey if you quit smoking, you'll get your sense of smell back."" I live in New York City, I got news for you folks, I don't want my fucking sense of smell back. || I, ah... this abortion issue in the States is dividing the country right in half. You know, and even amongst my friends - we're all highly intelligent - they're totally divided on the issue of abortion. Totally divided. Some of my friends think these pro-life people are just annoying idiots. Other of my friends think these pro-life people are evil fucks. How are we gonna have a consensus? I'm torn. I try and take the broad view and think of them as evil, annoying fucks. || I generally love my job. You know what the great thing about being a comic is? I have no boss. That's a definite lifestyle plus isn't it? Aren't bosses something? They're like gnats at a picnic man. Get the fuck out of here buddy, it's just a job, doesn't mean a thing. I smoked a joint this morning, you're lucky I showed. My bed was like a womb man. || People often ask me where I stand politically. It's not that I disagree with Bush's economic policy or his foreign policy, it's that I believe he was a child of Satan sent here to destroy the planet Earth. Little to the left. || That’s why my girlfriend and I broke up: she wanted kids, and I... well, she wanted kids. I had no idea her philosophy was that flawed. She goes, “Wouldn’t it be nice to have a kid? To have this fresh, clean slate which we could fill. A little clean spirit, innocent, and to fill it with good ideas.” Yeah, yeah, how about this? If you’re so fucking altruistic, why don’t you leave the little clean spirit wherever it is right now? Okay? Horrible act, childbirth. Nightmare. Bringing... I would never bring a kid to this fucking planet. || Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the Weather. || I've learned a lot about women. I think I've learned exactly how the fall of man occured in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, and Adam said one day, ""Wow, Eve, here we are, at one with nature, at one with God, we'll never age, we'll never die, and all our dreams come true the instant that we have them."" And Eve said, ""Yeah... it's just not enough is it?"" || The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question: ""Is this real, or is this just a ride?"" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, ""Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride."" And we kill those people. || I get a kick out of being an outsider constantly. It allows me to be creative. I don't like anything in the mainstream and they don't like me. || I love talking about the Kennedy assasination. The reason I do is because I'm fascinated by it. I'm fascinated that our government could lie to us so blatantly, so obviously for so long, and we do absolutely nothing about it. I think that's interesting in what is ostensibly a democracy. Sarcasm - come on in. People say ""Bill, quit talking about Kennedy man. It was a long time ago, just let it go, alright? It's a long time ago, just forget it."" I'm like, alright, then don't bring up Jesus to me. As long as we're talking shelf life here... || People are bringing shotguns to UFO sightings in Fife, Alabama. I asked a guy, ""Why do you bring a gun to a UFO sighting?"" Guy said, ""Way-ul, we didn' wanna be ab-duc-ted."" If I lived in Fife, Alabama, I would be on my hands and knees every night praying for abduction. || You know what causes sexual thoughts? I'm gonna clear the air for you tonight. I'm gonna end this debate, hopefully once and for all while on this planet, 'cause outer space awaits our presence, we are better and more unique creatures than this and all eternity is our playground, so let me go ahead and clear this one issue up once and for all and let's move on to real issues. Can we? Great. Here's what causes sexual thoughts. Ready, drumroll: having a dick. || People in the United Kingdom and outside the United States share my bemusement with the United States that America doesn't share with itself. || Ultimately, it is in fun. It is supposed to be highly entertaining. || Why do we put people who are on drugs in jail? They're sick, they're not criminals. Sick people don't get healed in prison. You see? It makes no sense. || There's some serious pockets of humanity out there. Go to some of these truck stops in the middle of nowhere you'll meet some serious folk. Order coffee the guy behind the counter goes 'you want the 32 oz. or the large?' Shit, how big is that large? 'You goin' want to pull yer car 'round back, I goin' start that pump.' That sounds like a lot of coffee, dude. I don't know if I want to be awake that long in Tennessee. On second thought give me that pussy size. || Listen, the next revolution is gonna be a revolution of ideas. || When two or more people agree on an issue, I form on the other side. || Folks, it's time to evolve. That's why we're troubled. You know why our institutions are failing us, the church, the state, everything's failing? It's because, um – they're no longer relevant. We're supposed to keep evolving. Evolution did not end with us growing opposable thumbs. You do know that, right? There's another 90 percent of our brains that we have to illuminate. || I am not promoting the use of drugs, I'm just saying if you're gonna have a war against drugs, have 'em against all drugs including alcohol, the number one offender, or shut the fuck up! || I've never seen people on pot get in a fight because it is fucking impossible. || Yeah, good to be here. I haven't been here in two years... Thanks. It's that warmth I've missed in Austin. So, we been here, ain't our fault you gotta travel around, shit. We supposed to follow you around? You supposed to be back here. What are you doin', where are you? || If you want to understand a society, take a good look at the drugs it uses. And what can this tell you about American culture? Well, look at the drugs we use. Except for pharmaceutical poison, there are essentially only two drugs that Western civilization tolerates: Caffeine from Monday to Friday to energize you enough to make you a productive member of society, and alcohol from Friday to Monday to keep you too stupid to figure out the prison that you are living in. || I'm sorry if any of you are catholic. I'm not sorry if you're offended, I'm actually just sorry by the fact that you're catholic. || So, it's good to be here, wherever I am. || Sometimes you feel in control, and it's great, but sometimes you just don't feel in control and you really have to struggle to get laughs. || How dare you have wino tell me not to do drugs. || They lie about marijuana. Tell you pot-smoking makes you unmotivated. Lie! When you're high, you can do everything you normally do just as well - you just realize that it's not worth the fucking effort. There is a difference. || What did moths bump into before the electric light bulb was invented? Boy, the lightbulb really screwed the moth up didn't it? Are there moths on their way to the sun now going, ""It's gonna be worth it!"".  || See we just had a misunderstanding. I thought we lived in the U.S. of A., the United States of America. But actually we live in the U.S. of A., the United States of Advertising. Freedom of expression is guaranteed? If you've got the money! || Watch CNN headline news for an hour, its the most depressing fucking thing: war, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression... And you look out your window... Where's all this shit happening?!"
Bill Maher,"Bush didn't really win on his popularity last time. He won on scaring people that Kerry might do something stupid like, I don't know, sell the ports to the Arabs. || The Clinton White House today said they would start to give national security and intelligence briefings to George Bush. I don't know how well this is working out. Today after the first one Bush said, ""I've got one question: What color is the red phone?"" || I saw this anti-drug commercial that showed a kid smoking pot in his dad`s room with his friend. This kid finds a gun, the gun accidentally goes off and kills his friend. Only in America is the villain in this commercial not guns or bad parenting, but pot. || Hi, I'm Bill. I'm a birth survivor. || To me a real patriot is like a real friend. Who's your real friend? It's the person who tells you the truth. That's who my real friends are. So, you know, I think as far as our country goes, we need more people who will do that. || Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need. || I wouldn't touch a hot dog unless you put a condom on it! You realize that the job of a hot dog is to use parts of the animal that the Chinese can't figure out how to make into a belt? || The ""Power of One"" is a slogan - not a goal. || I think religion is a neurological disorder. || I'll show you Obama's birth certificate when you show me Sarah Palin's high school diploma. || We’ve been on a long break and I’ve just been kicking back, doing nothing. Like our government. || There's more than one mosque in the world that used to be a church and before that was a temple. Because it's a lot easier to just change the sign on the top and say ""under new management"" than it is to change the whole building. || Canadian bacon isn't bacon. It's ham. || And then we get here and five minutes after we arrive, the skies open up. It's completely nice and there was a rainbow above the thing we were shooting. So, I don't know, if God didn't want us to shoot, he sure fucked up today. || Tiger Woods apologized to the three women in America he never got around to sleeping with. || It's like the lotto. ""You can't get saved if you don't play."" || Religions are maintained by people. People who can't get laid, because sex is the first great earthly pleasure. But if you can't get that, power is a pretty good second one. And that's what religion gives to people. Power. Power is sex for people who can't get or don't want or aren't any good at sex itself. || The only sport I really get into is snowboarding. Cause that’s the only sport where they perform a half pipe just after smoking a full pipe. || Whenever the people are for gay marriage or medical marijuana or assisted suicide, suddenly the ""will of the people"" goes out the window. || Don't you think that being a person of faith has become a third rail in American politics? If you want to run for president nowadays, you'd better get out there and say you're a very faith-based person. || I am so tired of rearranging my life around what the stupidest people might do. || I have a problem with people who take the Constitution loosely and the Bible literally. || You know what happens when windmills collapse into the sea? A splash. || I thought when we elected a black president, we were going to get a black president. You know, BP oil spill is where I want a real black president. I want him in a meeting with the BP CEOs, you know, where he lifts up his shirt so you can see the gun in his pants. That’s - ""we’ve got a motherfucking problem here?"" Shoot somebody in the foot. || That’s America for you - a red herring culture, always scared of the wrong things. The fact is, there are a lot of creepy middle-aged men out there lusting for your kids. They work for MTV, the pharmaceutical industry, McDonald’s, Marlboro and K Street. || If you, the citizen, deliberately vote for someone who won’t give you healthcare over someone who will, you need to have your head examined. Except you can’t afford to have your head examined. || We survived the 1980's. Back then, the economic program was called ""trickle down."" That actually meant they were pissing on you. How the whole theory goes was this: ""We have all the money. If we drop some, it's yours. Go for it."" || The country can't get well if the people are sick. And the people are sick. || The Democrats are very bad at selling their own product. The Republicans are geniuses at it. And I've said it before, a bad product well apologized for is superior in this country to a good product. || We have a Bill of Rights. What we need is a Bill of Responsibilities. || Why couldn't, uh, why couldn't have Rush Limbaugh croaked from it instead of Heath Ledger? || You know... there is a name for people who are always wrong about everything all the time... husband! || We need more people speaking out. This country is not overrun with rebels and free thinkers. It's overrun with sheep and conformists. || Remember, guns don't kill people - unless you practice real hard. || Everything that used to be a sin is now a disease. || I think we all remember that those first months after the attack, this country really was a very different country. I think we were ready to do anything. I think we would have marched into hell behind this guy... I think nobody in a position of leadership, not the Democrats, not the president, asked anyone in this country to rethink or redo anything. The most they asked us to do was to keep the economy going, to shop and go see shows again and travel. || If ketchup had 1/20th of the carcinogens in a cigarette they'd rip it off the shelves tomorrow, so the government is full of shit when they tell you that they care about you. || How does a country get away with keeping half its population in beekeeper suits? I'll tell you how. They say the magic word: religion. It's their religion. You say religion, you can get away with anything. The Catholics got away with fucking kids, for crying out loud! || I'd like to protect children, too, but… is everything worth sacrificing to that? I mean, drugs have done a lot of good. … They've midwived a lot of good ideas… lot of great songs, you know? I think ""Penny Lane"" is worth 10 dead kids. … I think Dark Side of the Moon is worth 100 dead kids. There, I said it. || I have a theory that the Internet makes people stupider - and also FOX News makes people stupider. || Again, America is a stupid country with stupid people who don’t pay attention. || My generation didn`t face the kind of urgent, pressing issues that my parents did, who fought through a war and a Depression and know what suffering is. That`s why Bob Dole had a tough time with this electorate. He was an old-fashioned curmudgeon who knew about sacrifice, and we didn`t know if we could live up to his standards. But we knew we could live up to Bill Clinton`s. He`s more like one of us. || The food is out of this world! || Anyone who is elected mayor of a place called ""Sin City"" is allowed to be a drunk. || New Rule: Stop whining about the French. It takes a lot of guts to stand up to the Bush administration and that's more than I can say about the Democrats! || You are what you do. It's about actions. || It`s all been satirized for your protection. || The Dalai Lama visited the White House and told the President that he could teach him to find a higher state of consciousness. Then after talking to Bush for a few minutes, he said, ""You know what? Let's just grab lunch."" || Iraq now says that it will, after all, destroy its missiles. President Bush said, ""Please, I used to pull the same trick. There'd be an intervention, I'd make a big show of pouring out the liquor and then there was a case under the floorboards."" || This is a ridiculous heat wave we're in right now, and to contribute, Newt Gingrich said that for the entire month of June, he will stop blowing hot air. || The country has become much more conservative, partly because it's been taken over by the religious right. || The jury could get the case as early as next week, but the defense says they just want to introduce one last-minute load of crap. || You can't run on a mistake. Franklin Roosevelt didn't run for re-election claiming Pearl Harbor was his finest hour. Abe Lincoln was a great president, but the high point of his second term wasn't theater security. 9/11 wasn't a triumph of the human spirit. It was a fuck-up by a guy on vacation. || There's no greater model, in my view, than Jesus Christ. || Why are there so many puritans in this country, and why can’t the rest of us make them go away?! || We're so inconsistent about what we let kill ya. ""Smoking? Must be eradicated. Marijuana? Zero tolerance."" But there's lots of ways to kill yourself. You know what I think kills you? Stress, and being a workaholic, and never getting laid, and, uh, McDonalds, and staying mad at people, and lying for a living, and three-martini lunches, and the all-American breakfast, and whatever the fuck Elvis was doing. That's what kills you. || I think capital punishment works great. Every killer you kill never kills again. || Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking. It's nothing to brag about. || This country has fuck-up fatigue. That's when someone fucks up so much, that when they fuck up again, people go, ""Well, what do you expect? He's a fuck-up."" And that's fucked up! || All I did was tell the truth. That's is what the whole show is about! And if ""Politically Incorrect"" has to go down for it, so be it! || If I just sit here every Friday night and spout Bush administration talking points, that's not information or entertainment, it's Fox News! || White people have always shown their superiority over blacks with their feet, moving out of black neighborhoods with the fear that their kids will turn into one of them. And now, through the magic of MTV, damned if it didn't turn out that way! || The Bush Administration is always saying, ""We don't hear the good news."" Yeah, because the journalists are saying, ""Cover me, I'm going to the ice machine."" || Doctors said that the test most commonly used to screen for colon cancer doesn't go far enough. They're recommending a procedure that involves photographing the entire colon. I say, don't vie CBS an idea for another reality show. || A lot of good has come from drugs. I think ""Penny Lane"" is worth 10 dead kids. Dark Side of the Moon is worth 100 dead kids. Because a lot of kids wouldn't even be born if it weren't for that album, so it evens out. || Sex is too easy for women to get, and too hard for men. I mean, honestly, for a man to walk into someplace and have every woman ready to take him home, he'd have to rule the world. A woman would have to do her hair. || We do it all the time, we legislate taste. We do it with the tax code. Churches and children get a tax break, because it's assumed that we all agree that we want to encourage churches and children. I don't. I don't. That's my opinion. I don't want to encourage either churches or children, and it's a very bad idea to put them together. || Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking - its nothing to brag about. And those who preach faith, and enable it, and elevate it, are our intellectual slaveholders - keeping mankind in a bondage to fantasy and nonsense that has spawned and justified so much lunacy and destruction. || When sex is good theres nothing better, when its bad its not bad. || Little do women know what big ideas I have in my pants. || In this country your guilty until proven wealthy. || I believe in God, I just give him more credit than being a single parent and an author. || There are people who think everything is a conspiracy and I think they’re crazy. || They’re all for changing the laws except when it comes to their campaign donors. || God makes trees, he doesn't write books. || What's it going to take to get these people who refuse to believe that global warming exists to get in touch with reality? Where do they think exhaust goes - Bunnyland? || You can't claim you're for peace if you're not willing to disturb it. || Anyone who tells you that they know, they just know what happens when you die, I promise you, you dont. How can I be so sure? Because I dont know and you do not possess mental powers that I do not. || I don't respect religon. I don't respect superstitious thinking and that is what religous is. || You want to spend your millions on a worthless cause? Try donating it to the Democrats. || The church has historically been very slow to embrace technology. Until very recently, their idea of a laptop was an altar boy. || Face the fact that there's only one sure-fire way to erase credit card debt. By picking up a big, shiny pair of scissors and cutting your wife in half. || My father said, ""Bring along your best girl."" This is something you say to a pimp! || Jesus, as a philosopher is wonderful. There's no greater role model, in my view, than Jesus Christ. It's just a shame that most of the people who follow him and call themselves Christians act nothing like him. || At least half of the Ten Commandments are stupid! || I wish someone would just start Fly At Your Own Risk Airlines. How 'bout that? You can have your hair gel, you can have your lighter, you can have a fucking gun, how bout that? You can show up at the gate five minutes before the plane leaves, and pay in cash, like in the good ol' 1980's. The ticket just says ""shit happens"" on the back, because that's the way it is anyway. || Atheism is a religion like abstinence is a sex position. || My wife always has a splitting archetype whenever I want to have sex. || Space tourism is God's way of telling you you aren't spending enough on lap dances, baccarat and cocaine. || When I was in high school the worst thing you could ever get was VD. Talk about the sniffles! I just want to meet an old-fashioned girl with gonorrhea. || In ancient times they sacrificed the virgins. Men were not about to sacrifice the sluts! || The rebel army in Libya is just like 1,000 guys in Toyota trucks. The world is asking the question; can 1000 anti-government guys in pick-up trucks with small arms, take over a country of millions? To which I say, ask the Teabaggers. || People have romantic notions about television. In the highest realms they think it's some sort of art medium, and it's not. Others think it's an entertainment medium, it's not that either. It's an advertising medium. It's a method to deliver advertising like a cigarette is a method to deliver nicotine. || Jim Bakker spells his name with 2 k's because 3 would be too obvious. || The New York Times - but the whole country gives it that weight. It's like the Asian kid in math class. Everybody in the media cheats off The New York Times. || The plain fact is religion must die for mankind to live. The hour is getting very late to be able to indulge in having key decisions made by religious people - by irrationalists - by those who would steer the ship of state, not by a compass, but by the equivalent of reading the entrails of a chicken. || The Founding Fathers were more deists. If you had to categorize them as anything. There was some sort of moving prime force. But it's an impersonal force. Some people call it Nature. Certainly not this personal god who you have a personal relationship with, who listens to your prayers and answers them, or doesn't. You know, not the silly stuff that most Americans believe because we're such a dumb nation. || I get the Playboy thing a lot. People assume I go out with bimbos. I couldn`t go out with bimbos if I tried! I scare them off! The women that like me are smart. So I go to the Playboy Mansion four or five times a year, but people think I go all the time. || In America, if a Democrat even thinks you’re calling him liberal he grabs an orange vest and a rifle and heads into the woods to kill something. || By now you’ve heard the constant right wing attacks on the elite media and the liberal elite, who may or may not be part of Washington elite, a subset of the East Coast elite, which is overtly influenced by the Hollywood elite. So, basically, unless you’re a shit-kicker from Kansas, you’re with the terrorists. || What is with this campy fixation on all things Ronald Reagan? They talk about him the way gay people talk about Barbra Streisand. I think they just want him on a stamp so they can lick his ass. I think they only named an airport after him so they can say, ""I'm coming into Reagan!"" || I want to thank some very special people without whom I would not be here today. George Bush, Sarah Palin and the Pope. When I came to Hollywood in 1983, I had one dream - to sleep with Jodie Foster. That didn't work out, but this is nice, too. || If conservatives get to call universal healthcare ""socialized medicine"", I get to call private, for-profit healthcare ""soulless, vampire bastards making money off human pain"". || Fame has sent a number of celebrities off the deep end, and in the case of Michael Jackson, to the kiddy pool. || Curious people are intersting people, I wonder why that is. || We are a nation that is unenlightened because of religion. I do believe that. I think religion stops people from thinking. I think it justified crazies. || People say I'm into black women. Robert De Niro is into black women. I'm just into women who are real, and they happen to be black. || I think the funniest stuff comes from the heaviest stuff. || If nobody is clear on what you're protesting, it's not a protest. Thousands of people gathered in London this week to voice their disapproval of the G-20. Their basic message being, ""Stop all your globalizing and unite the world!"" || What is it with conservatives? Seriously, I'm not trying to be partisan but it seems like if they're anti-illegal alien, they have illegal aliens working for them. If they're anti-gay, they turn out to be gay. If they're super Christian, they're a witch. || Recently, there's been a trend in America that I find very disturbing... rewarding immoral and illegal behavior...For example, we now give free needles to junkies, which seems to me to be only a step away from giving condoms to rapists. || I think what's dangerous is the idea that someone can wash away your sins. || I don't dislike children, I just don't particularly want to be around with them a lot. Problem is, neither do their parents. || It's so childish, ""greatest country in the world."" It's like saying, ""I have the best wife in the world. Not just the one best suited for me, the best wife in the world. And if you could have my wife, you'd kill your wife."" || Don't say a woman is crazy just because she runs away from her wedding. || Is it like gay men go into the priesthood because they figure, ""Well, this'll solve my problem. I can't be a homosexual in the priesthood; it'll just go away. Maybe I'll try it with the Republican Party."" || In this country, a smart leader is suspect. That's just the way it is. Even George Bush's father, who was a lot smarter than the son, had to sort of prove that he wasn't that bright. || Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't make you spiritual. It's right above the crack of your ass, and it translate to ""beef with broccoli"". The last time you did anything spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not spiritual. You're just high. || The president is not doing well with African Americans. His popularity rating - his approval rating - with blacks: two percent. Two percent. That is somewhere between Mark Fuhrman and sickle cell anemia. || People on the right say to people like me, ""Oh, you hate America."" And I always say, ""No, I love America. I want it back. I don't want you representing it. I don't want torture representing it."" If I hated it, I'd be okay with being represented by the torturers. || A president can be unpopular for good reasons. You know, I'm not always on the side that the people are right, for God's sake. But, you know, he's not popular when he goes overseas. He couldn't go to Rosa Parks' funeral. || Bush is in command. And when he heard that sectarian militias had killed hundreds of Iraqis, he called for an immediate invasion of Sectaria. || I think girls hate each other, no doesn't always mean no, you have to lie to stay married, women's sports are boring and the Olympics are gay. || All birds masturbate. Yeah, you thought that was shit on your car. || Guys you have way too much invested in sport. Guys you are not the tenth man. You're a machine for turning beer into piss that's what you are! || Obama is huge in the polls these days. His popularity is soaring. Even conservatives are coming around. 30 percent of them now believe Obama deserves a Green Card. || There were two Republican responses to the State of the Union. So if you watched the whole night, it was kind of evolution in reverse. You have Obama, then Paul Ryan, and then Michele Bachmann. Then Animal Planet had a squirrel monkey give his take. || The younger generation is supposed to rage against the machine, not for it. They're supposed to question authority, not question those who question authority. || Hollywood isn't your cesspool, America. It's your mirror. || Like it or not, we’re still a primitive tribe ruled by fears, superstition and misinformation. || This has been a learning experience for me. I also thought that privacy was something we were granted in the Constitution. I have learned from this when in fact the word privacy does not appear in the Constitution. || A group of Cuban Americans denounced the Castro government as a fascist regime that monitors and scrutinized its citizens' everyday existence. And then they excused themselves to go watch ""Big Brother"". || I said I didn't respect religion... and anyone who believes in fairy tales to answer questions that we can't answer. So I don't respect our religions either. But I do believe it is a clash of civilizations, absolutely, between the Islamic world and the Western world. It has been going on for 1,000 years. || All across the Middle East in the streets, people are demanding democracy. It's amazing. The only way in America you get people to get worked up like that is to threaten to give them health care. || Religion, it stops people from thinking because they think all the answers are in that one book; it impedes progress; it justifies crazy people. Flying planes into a building was a faith-based initiative. || In no way was I intending to say, nor have I ever thought, that the men and women who defend our nation in uniform are anything but courageous and valiant, and I offer my apologies to anyone who took it wrong. || That's right. It turns out we've all been taking relationship advice from the fat middle-aged, bald guy who drives a Ferrari! || Clinton could have done a better job with the hurricane while having sex. || I have a high state of resentment for the conformity in this country. If you`re not married and having children, it`s like your life is empty or you`re a communist meanie. || I'll clue you in on a secret: death is not the worst thing that could happen to you. I know we think that; we are the first society ever to think that. It's not worse than dishonor; it's not worse than losing your freedom; its not worse than losing a sense of personal responsibility. || The other guys are selling certainty. Not me. I'm on the corner with doubt. || The true Axis of Evil in America is the genius of our marketing combined with the stupidity of our people. || Jesus is not a candle. A company in South Dakota is selling candles with the scent of Jesus. You light one and your friends says, ""Christ, what's that smell?"" || False hope really makes you cynical. || I think pornography stops rape, AIDS ribbons are stupid, and flag burning makes me feel patriotic. || The House okayed the gasoline tax cut, which will increase the deficit, line the pockets of the oil companies, and hurt the environment; Dole said that if there was just some way this could interfere with people's sex lives, it would be perfect legislation. || If you're keeping score at home, they have now applauded executions at the Republican debate, they have cheered letting an uninsured man die, and they booed an active duty U.S. serviceman for being gay. I don’t know how you get to the right with this crowd but Ron Paul’s new campaign ad is just the Rodney King beating to the sound of children laughing. || The jury could get the case as early as next week, but the defense says they just want to introduce one last-minute load of crap. || I think America causes cancer, longevity is less important than fun, and young people should be discouraged from voting. || I have such disdain for anybody who gets joy out of blowing the stuffing out of a little woodland creature, that I don't really care if any of them gets shot. || Nobody sees people as people. It's all how they relate to my little group. || Amazon has included me in an opportunity to provide top-shelf television-style programming live on the world's computer screens. To hold forth with the industry's very best actors, directors, musicians, authors - I'm thrilled to be on the cutting edge of this. || Well, that's exactly the wrong attitude. That is not the attitude they had in World War II. Your attitude is that freedom means you can do whatever you want whenever you want it, and that sacrifice is somehow un-American. But the idea that we should also be defensive about our flaws and weaknesses and our vulnerabilities is ridiculous. || If you have a few hundred followers and you let some of them molest children, they call you a cult leader. If you have a billion, they call you Pope. || I want to always be an interloper. I never want to feel like I'm a guy who is embraced by the people who are putting me on the air. I want to feel like I broke into the studio and took over and made them mad. If I'm not doing that, I'm not doing my job. || This has been a learning experience for me. I also thought that privacy was something we were granted in the Constitution. I have learned from this when in fact the word privacy does not appear in the Constitution. || Did you hear this – Sarah Palin finally heard what happened in Japan and she’s demanding that we invade Tsunami. I mean she said, ""These Tsunamians will not get away with this"". Oh speaking of dumb twats, did you... || What Democratic congressmen do to their women staffers, Republican congressmen do to the country. || Men are only as loyal as their options. || When you want to make it clear to the rest of the world that you are not an imperialist, the best countries to have with you are Britain and Spain. || I do think the patriotic thing to do is to critique my country. How else do you make a country better but by pointing out its flaws? || Bush gave an interview and he said people will vote for him because ""They've seen me weep, they’ve seen me laugh, and they’ve seen me hug."" These are the same qualifications for a Tickle Me Elmo. || We have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, it's not cowardly. || Things aren't right. If a burglar breaks into your home and you shoot him, he can sue you. For what, restraint of trade? || Saddam Hussein is Hitler like Oasis was The Beatles. || What I have against religion is that they start you when you are so defenseless. I mean, I was three when they started pumping this bullshit into my head. I believed in Santa Claus and the Fairy Godmother, of course I believed in a virgin birth, and a guy lived in a whale, and a woman came from a rib. But then something happened that made me doubt all of it: I graduated sixth grade! || The cable TV sex channels don't expand our horizons, don't make us better people and don't come in clearly enough. || But isn't there something wrong when I'm the only guy in the country that got fired for 9/11? || If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence, and sheer ignorance as religion is, youd resign in protest. To do otherwise is to be an enabler - a mafia wife. || When we talk about values, I think of rationality in solving problems. That’s something I value. Fairness, kindness, generosity, tolerance. When they talk about values, they’re talking about things like going to church, voting for Bush, being loyal to Jesus, praying. These are not values. || Since the Icelandic volcano obviously needs a virgin sacrifice and the Catholic Church obviously needs new leadership the Pope must volunteer to jump in the volcano. Pontiff, don't think of it as endorsing paganism, think of it as supersizing Ash Wednesday. || Please stop assuming that longevity and perfect health is always the correct option. No. Sometimes fun costs ya. It just does, you know? And that's OK, you're willing to make that purchase. Sammy Davis, Jr. was 64 when he died. Give me 64 Sammy-years, I'll be happy. || I was just at the newly opened Creationist Museum in Kentucky.... And they have this exhibit of a giant dinosaur...with a saddle on its back. Because the world is only 5000 years old, so man and the dinosaurs had to coexist, and, of course, we rode them. A theory I thought laughable at the age of eight when I saw it on the Flintstones! || Suicide is man's way of telling God, ""You can't fire me - I quit!"" || George Bush says, ""Gore's book needs a lot of explaining."" Of course, Bush says that about every book. || The problem is that the people with the most ridiculous ideas are always the people who are most certain of them. || I love Jesus. I just don’t like the Christians who don’t believe in what he says. || I think we need to change that old saying, ""I don't need a building to fall on me."" Because two did and we still don't get it. I think we all stick our head in the sand as a deep human impulse. || Government - they used to teach it in college. It's actually something you should study and learn and know how to do. The Republicans always run on the idea that government isn't very effective. Well, not the way you do it. But it can be effective. || If I thought the Lord was speaking to me I'd check myself into Bellevue, and I think you should too. || We don't like mystery. You like mystery, 'cause it's not a mystery to you; you know when you're gonna get laid. || The thing I don't understand about homosexuals is, how do they decide which one is the one who's supposed to pretend they don't want it? || The comedy gods are smiling on me tonight, because for the longest time, I have said that president Bush must set a timetable for removing his head from his ass... and, by god, last week they went in and looked for it. They didn't find it, so now we don't know where it is, but at least for once in my life, I get to see the words ""Bush"", ""operation"", and ""successful"" in the same sentence. || Just honest. To me, being 'politically incorrect' means the opposite of being political - which means to spin everything. That's all it's ever meant to me. It's never meant liberal or conservative. It means honest. || If we stopped calling it profiling and started calling it ""proactive intelligence screening"" or ""high alert detecting"", people would be saying ""Well, it's about time"". || You know, if you're an American and you're born at this time in history especially, you're lucky. We all are. We won the world history Powerball lottery. || Now, I'm no doctor, but I am on TV. And in my professional opinion, George Bush is a paranoid schizophrenic. || A new biography of Madonna came out last week, and apparently the biography lists all the men she's slept with. The book is apparently called the Manhattan Telephone Directory. || And for the record, all marriages are same sex marriages. You get married, and every night, it's the same sex. || They're talking about banning cigarette smoking now in any place that's used by ten or more people in a week, which, I guess, means that Madonna can't even smoke in bed. || The whole dating ritual was different when I was a kid. Girls got pinned - not nailed. || Cornbread isn't bread. It's cake. || Freedom isn't free. It shouldn't be a bragging point that ""Oh, I don't get involved in politics"", as if that makes you somehow cleaner. No, that makes you derelict of duty in a republic. Liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didn't insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable. || Kids. They're not easy. But there has to be some penalty for sex. || The only appropriate attitude for man to have about the big questions, is not the arrogant certitude that is the hallmark of religion, but doubt. Doubt is humble and that is what man needs to be, considering that human history is just a litany of getting shit dead wrong. || You can't lie to kids about drugs. They know about drugs. You can't say they're just all bad. They know life is a little more complicated. I have never done heroin. I would never recommend heroin, but it hasn't hurt my record collection. || I think religion is bad and drugs are good. || In New York now, they have Harvey Milk High School for gay students. They don't have much of a football team, but the half-time show... || If you think you have it tough, read history books. || Let's make a law that gay people can have birthdays, but straight people get more cake - you know, to send the right message to kids. || Women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them. || That's what's so great about the Internet. It allows pompous blow-hards to connect with other pompous blow-hards in a vast circle-jerk of pomposity. || Can we go back to using Facebook for what it was originally for - looking up exes to see how fat they got? || Saying someone is religious is heard in most of America as a compliment, a reassuring affirmation that someone will be moral, ethical, and after a few glasses of wine, a freak in the bedroom. || Be out of the mainstream. I'm out of the mainstream. I enjoy it, who wants to be in the mainstream? || The Bible looks like it started out as a game of mad libs. || Maybe every other American movie shouldn't be based on a comic book. Other countries will think Americans live in an infantile fantasy land where reality is whatever we say it is and every problem can be solved with violence. || Let's face it; God has a big ego problem. Why do we always have to worship him? || The tea baggers. The one thing they hate is when you call them racist. The other thing they hate is black people. But they won't say it. || Whenever you combine a secretive compound, religion, and weirdos in pioneer outfits, there's gonna be some child fucking going on. || I'm staying in a strange hotel. I called room service for a sandwich and they sent up two hookers. || If conservatives get to call universal healthcare ""socialized medicine"", I get to call private, for-profit healthcare ""soulless, vampire bastards making money off human pain"". || Republicans have become the party of red, white and blue rose colored glasses. By drowning out criticism with USA! USA!, they prevent this country from healing itself where it needs healing, and that is the opposite of Country First. || Don't you miss the days when America was just morally bankrupt? || Isn't Bush the worst president ever? I mean, when his term is over, he has to walk back to Texas. || Only 42 percent of Republicans believe Obama was born in the United States. That's an amazing statistic. How come in America Christians are the only ones who won't take anything on faith? || I have zero doubt that if Dick Cheney was not in power, people wouldn’t be dying needlessly tomorrow... I’m just saying if he did die, other people, more people would live. That’s a fact. || Stop worrying. Hollywood won't turn your daughter into a nymphomaniac or get her hooked on drugs... I will. || Our mistakes from the past are just that: mistakes. And they were necessary to make in order to become the wiser person we became. || So when I say we had been the cowards, yes, that's what I meant, we as a society. And that's everybody, including myself. I had been screaming about the drug war and this war and other wars. I should have been more on terrorism, too. So should you, so should everybody. || In New York, Catholic groups have forced an art gallery to shut down an exhibition of a six-foot image of Jesus in chocolate. So, the Archbishop of New York was very upset. He said, “It is appalling to make Jesus out of food! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go bake some communion wafers.” || If churches don't have to pay taxes, they also can't call the fire department when they catch fire. Sorry reverend, that's one of those services that goes along with paying in. I'll use the fire department I pay for. You can pray for rain. || Mr. President, there are some people who are never going to like you. That's why they voted for the old guy and Carrie's mom. You're not going to win them over. Stand up for the 70% of Americans who aren't crazy. || It's not a mystery to me what happened with 9/11. These guys are out there. We knew they were out there. It was a failure of will on our part to address the situation 10 years before. There is no big mystery about it. || I mean, maybe one day we will live in a more optimum world where terrorists come in every color of the rainbow. But the truth is, now they don't. I mean, the people who are trying to get us are young Muslim men, period. || Do you think it's possible that when we're on something like marijuana or mushrooms and we believe we're having a really spiritual experience that we're just high? || If you believe that the world is going to come to an end - and perhaps any day now - does it not drain one's motivation to improve life on earth while we're here? || Rush Limbaugh, who has made a career preaching that anybody who does drugs has got to go right to jail - do not pass go, no questions asked, right to jail - gets caught doing thirty oxycontin a day. Thirty oxycontin?! Do you have any idea how high that is?! I don't, and I've been pretty high! || Clinton left the White House with all the class of an XFL halftime show. || You can’t be a rational person six days a week and on one day of the week, go to a building, and think you are drinking the blood of a two thousand year old space god. That doesn’t make you a person of faith, that makes you a schizophrenic. || But I’ve often said that if I had - I have two dogs - if I had two retarded children, I’d be a hero. And yet the dogs, which are pretty much the same thing. What? They’re sweet. They’re loving. They’re kind, but they don’t mentally advance at all. Dogs are like retarded children. || To those people who say, ""My father is alive because of animal experimentation"", I say ""Yeah, well, good for you. This dog died so your father could live."" Sorry, but I am just not behind that kind of trade off. || I always compare marriage to communism. They're both institutions that don't conform to human nature, so you're going to end up with lying and hypocrisy. || I know a whole generation has been raised on the notion of multiculturalism; that all civilizations are just different. No! Not always. Sometimes things are better! Rule of law is better than autocracy and theocracy; equality of the sexes, better; protection of minorities, better; free speech, better; free elections, better; free appliances with large purchases, better! Don't get so tolerant that you tolerate intolerance. || I don't want to be a pessimist. I'm a realist. One man's realist is another man's pessimist. || I don't hate America. I love America. I want it to be better. The only way we can get it to be better is to realistically criticize what's wrong with it. || There's a word the teabaggers have wanted to use since Obama came on the scene, but they can't because it's not the 1950s. They would love to say this word. It begins with an N and ends with -er, and it's not ""nation-builder"". || I kid the Republicans, with love. I feel bad for them. They got nobody for next time. Who are they gonna run? Sara Palin, reading off her hand. Did you see that? You saw this? She wrote ""tax cuts"" on her hand. A Republican so stupid she has to be reminded of the one thing– Tax cuts! This is like if you saw the coyote's paw and it said ""Road Runner"". || They keep pushing the idea, ""The only reliable way to prevent pregnancy is to not have sex at all, because, condoms? Ooh, very unreliable, condoms break all the time."" Okay. I've been using these things for thirty-five years. I've never had one break. Either I'm the luckiest son-of-a-bitch who ever lived - and I'm not - or this is the most reliable invention since the toaster. || I want to see riots! I want to see the kind of riots where cab drivers are afraid to pick up white people! I want to see this guy! || There are two things that you have to lie to get through. One is politics, and the other is marriage. || If conservatives don't want to be seen as bitter people who cling to their guns and religion and anti-immigrant sentiments, they should stop being bitter and clinging to their guns, religion and anti-immigrant sentiments. || And to answer the question that people have about this conspiracy theory that he has a pack in his back, my answer is, if someone was feeding him answers, couldn't they be able to feed him better ones than he came up with? || I'm supposed to be all re-injected with yes-we-can fever after the big health care speech, and it was a great speech - when Black Elvis gets jiggy with his teleprompter, there is none better. But here's the thing: Muhammad Ali also had a way with words, but it helped enormously that he could also punch guys in the face. || President Bush never really has to answer a question. Nobody ever says to him, ""With due respect, sir, your answer had absolutely nothing to do with the question I asked."" || Republicans are always saying we should privatize things like schools, prisons, social security - hey, how about we privatize privacy! Because if the government forbids gay men from tying the knot, what is their alternative? They can`t all marry Liza Minnelli. || We're always on a tightrope. We're trying to put together people who don't make sense to be together, talking about issues that are sensitive and controversial. We're mixing dangerous chemicals on a nightly basis. || I like groaning. That means that you're not pandering to their already settled prejudices. || On the show, I do a very serious thing. And a lot of people have a hard time reconciling that with what I'm going to do after the show. They can't get it into their heads: ""How can he be talking to Madeleine Albright one minute and then somebody half his age...."" They're just jealous. But I never made any bones about it. I am a player. Always have been. || I don't want my president to be a TV star. You don't have to be on television every minute of every day - you're the president, not a rerun of ""Law & Order"". TV stars are too worried bout being popular and too concerned about being renewed. || I would describe my spirituality as exactly the opposite of having a religious affiliation. || That's ended, that's over. I want you to meet my pimps. I thought, I'm a show-business ho already, so I might as well be a real ho. || Who takes care of their people better? FEMA or Hezbollah? || Abstinence is a perversion. || Why is monotheistic faith better than polytheistic? I mean, either you believe – if you believe in, like, a magic person who can do magic things, why is it different – so different if it’s Superman or the Fantastic Four? || The reason I love my dog so much is because when I come home, he's the only one in the world who treats me like I'm The Beatles. || I thought this election was an adult discussion on how best to protect ourselves in the face of terrorism, but apparently it was a referendum on boys kissing. When homophobia trumps terrorism in America, wow. This country needs to get laid. || If Jesus was a Jew, why did he have a Spanish name? || Only cowards push a button from thousands of miles away, or tens of thousands of feet up, to kill people who can't possibly fight back. || Rational people, anti-religionists, must end their timidity and come out of the closet and assert themselves. And those who consider themselves only moderately religious really need to look in the mirror and realize that the solace and comfort that religion brings you actually comes at a terrible price. || That's religion. You pray. You bow. You kneel. You fast. You trim the balls of a giant space penis. || A new cologne is coming out. It's for cowboys, and it's made from cow's manure. That way the women will be on you like flies! || Love does not conquer all. || That’s why I don’t have a religion. I don’t want to have to say that, okay, I agree with everything a guy says."
Billy Connolly,"My advice to you, if you want to lose a bit of weight: don't eat anything that comes in a bucket. Buckets are the kitchen utensils of the farmyard. || I don't believe in angels and I have trouble with the whole God thing. I don't want to say I don't believe in God, but I don't think I do. But I believe in people who do. || I don't understand art-speak. My pictures are big doodles. I'm amazed what people come up with when they look at them. There's one of a figure with two heads that somebody thought must be a comment on the state of matrimony. None of it is a comment on anything. || Who discovered we could get milk from cows, and what did he think he was doing at the time? || I have been made redundant before and it is a terrible blow; redundant is a rotten word because it makes you think you are useless. || Ally MacLeod thinks that tactics are a new kind of mint. || If you don't know how to meditate at least try to spend some time every day just sitting. || There is no such thing as bad language: it's just our morals that are fucked. || Why do they call it an asteroid when it's outside the hemisphere, but call it a haemorrhoid when it's on the outside of your ass? || My black-eye and fat lip suggests that 'up the backside'... was definitely the wrong answer, when my girlfriend asked me 'where are you taking me for my birthday?' || Honestly some folk will take offence at anything, I met a bloke with no legs this morning while at the bus stop, all I asked was ""How are you getting on?"" || Now the country is in a terrible state and you've blamed it on a number of things - unemployment rate, the value of the pound, and all that. It's actually because the national anthem is boring. || Do you remember that politician who died with the fishnet tights and all that? Aw, his poor family. I wonder how they dress him in the coffin? || There's nothing like it, but it's not as good as you think it's going to be... I was disappointed because there are records of people finding things that have been there for years. I was hoping for a shirt button, or my club's badge - but not a sausage. || The human race has been set up. Someone, somewhere, is playing a practical joke on us. Apparently, women need to feel loved to have sex. Men need to have sex to feel loved. How do we ever get started? || So, have you heard about the oyster who went to a disco and pulled a mussel? || When people say ""life is short"". What the fuck? Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever fucking does! What can you do that's longer? || The only time I would like to see was the 20s and 30s in America because I love the music and the style and the optimism, I wanted to see New York being built. I wanted to see all that, you know. || Behind the proscenium arch, you can't always hear what people in the audience are saying. || It seems to me that Islam and Christianity and Judaism all have the same god, and he's telling them all different things. || I've always been fascinated by the difference between the jokes you can tell your friends but you can't tell to an audience. There's a fine line you have to tread because you don't know who is out there in the auditorium. A lot of people are too easily offended. || The great thing about Glasgow is that if there's a nuclear attack it'll look exactly the same afterwards. || Politically correct is the language of cowardice. || My wife said ""I want to sell the house and buy a yacht"". I said ""What!? You do realise I live here? Comedian, Scottish guy. There's 3 kids over there, each have their own rooms. C'mon, I'll show you, they live here too."" || A lot of people say that it's a lack of vocabulary that makes you swear. Rubbish. I know thousands of words but I still prefer ""fuck"". || My definition of an intellectual is someone who can listen to the William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger. || Once you become successful, people know where you live, the type of house you live in, the kind of car you drive, the clothes you wear, and so it would be patronising to go and talk like a welder. Welding's a mystery to me now. You can't go back, your life changes every day. || As soon as I got successful, the Scottish press started picking on me. It's something they reserve just for me. || I'm much bigger in Britain than I am there. I'm well-known, but my name's That Guy in America... People shout: ""Hey ­I know you! You're That Guy."" || I don't aim to offend. || Avoid people who say they know the answer. Keep the company of people who are trying to understand the question. || Oh, I can picture myself rattling along Route 66 on that thing, headphones on, singing along to ZZ Top's 'Sharp Dressed Man' or the opening line from 'Born to be Wild' by Steppenwolf - 'Get your motor running...' The trike brings out that in all of us, which is no bad thing. Forget Viagra, get yourself a trike! || Life for me is great. I'm a very fuckin' wealthy person, I'm married to a very beautiful woman and I get laid with monotonous regularity. || Never turn down an opportunity to shout ""Fuck them all!"" at the top of your voice. || Paddy was in the delivery room when the midwife handed him a black baby. ""Is this yours?"" she asked ""probably"" said Paddy ""she burns everything else"" || My missus has just gone into hospital with 2 black eyes and a broken jaw! It seems we were on different wavelengths when she said she wanted decking on the patio. || Try to live in a place you like. || A biker goes to the Doctor with hearing problems ""Can you describe the symptoms to me"". ""Yes. Homer is a fat yellow lazy bastard and Marg is a skinny bird with big blue hair!"" || Learn to feel sorry for music because, although it is the international language, it has no swear words. || When people say ""Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too"". Fucking right! What good is a cake if you can't eat it? || Save the Trees? Trees are the main cause of Forest Fires! || I set out to be a cross between Lenny Bruce and Robert the Bruce - my main thrust was the body and its functions and malfunctions - the absurdity of the thing. || People die all the time. It's just that you're not around. || In Scotland, there is no such thing as bad weather - only the wrong clothes. || The working classes, the ones they refer to in those political programmes as ""the ordinary people"". || I was always confused with what was near-sight and what was far-sight. Now I'm not confused at all: I've got both, I don't give a fuck which is which. || Don't work out, work in. || Apparently the only way to avoid a sudden agonising death, is to walk around in tights with a bottle of vinegar. I'd rather be fucking dead! || When you're eating something and someone asks 'Is that nice?' No it's really revolting - I always eat stuff I hate. || Fame is being asked to sign your autograph on the back of a cigarette packet. || If you write a book, be sure it has exactly seventy-six ""fucks"" in it. || People who are willing to get off their arse to search the entire room for the TV remote because they refuse to walk to the TV and change the channel manually. || I like Dali and Magritte. I also like the Scottish artist John Byrne, another surrealist. || I still do my comedy and my performance stuff and my acting so it's not all-consuming. But I do find myself drawing more and more these days. || I think my securities far outweigh my insecurities. I am not nearly as afraid of myself and my imagination as I used to be. || My parents used to take me to the pet department and tell me it was a zoo. || What always staggers me is that when people blow their noses, they always look into their hankies to see what came out. What do they expect to find? || I'd always been scared of people with tertiary education and high intellects in case they found me wanting. I thought they viewed me as just a welder who knew a few jokes. || I'm famous for my bottom dances, but you'll only see my bum and willy if you raise a million pounds within an hour. || I'm sure everyone in this room has been told a joke about that subject. I have many times and I've laughed, even though they are horrifying and shocking... I think there's no boundary at all, whether it's that subject or another. || People who point at their wrist while asking for the time... I know where my watch is pal, where the fuck is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is? || But still, I kept thinking, if I'm still troubled by this, if I'm still carrying it around like a big rucksack full of bricks and my father's dead, I need someone to tell me how to get rid of this great weight... The most awful thing was that it was kind of pleasant physically, you know. That's why nobody tells. || Two guys are talking and one says to the other: 'What would you do if the end of the world was in 3 minutes time?' The other one says: 'I'd shag everything that moved. What would you do?' And he says: 'I'd stand perfectly still.'  || All anyone really needs to know about barbed wire is that it can tear the arse out of your trousers, give a cow a good fright, entangle a Yorkshire terrier for life, and is nasty stuff made by greedy men. || Sometimes there's a tackiness about Route 66 that out-tacks any tackiness I've ever seen anywhere else. And the Meramec Caverns are the pinnacle of that tack. || I'm a citizen of the world. I like it that way. The world's a wonderful. I just think that some people are pretty badly represented. But when you speak to the people themselves they're delightful. They all want so little. || Life is a waste of time, and time is a waste of life. Get wasted all the time, and you'll have the time of your life! || I set out to be a cross between Lenny Bruce and Robert the Bruce - my main thrust was the body and its functions and malfunctions - the absurdity of the thing. || A gypsy girl sent an email to an agony Aunt ""I am 12 years old and haven't had sex yet, do you think my brother is queer?"" || Look at this way: if we all ate one person, the problem would be halved over-night. Think about it: I could eat someone you don't like, you could eat someone I don't like... where's the fucking damage? || Scottish-Americans tell you that if you want to identify tartans, it's easy - you simply look under the kilt, and if it's a quarter-pounder, you know it's a McDonald's. || The religion in Scotland is one of the most patronising things... after the weather. || A fart is just your arse applauding. || McDonalds staff who pretend they don't understand you unless you insert the 'Mc' before the item you are ordering... It's has to be a McChicken Burger, just a Chicken Burger get blank looks. Well I'll have a McStraw and jam it in your McEyes you fucking McTosser. || There are two seasons in Scotland: June and Winter. || Never trust a man, who when left alone with a tea cosey... Doesn't try it on. || There's nothing better than a fight, especially when you're watching it from a safe place. You can yell encouragement! Hit him with the left, he's a big Jessie! || Nothing good comes from Switzerland! Cuckoo clocks and fucking Toblerones! || Don't tell me how to do my job. I don't come to your workplace and tell you how to sweep up. || I've always wanted to go to Switzerland to see what the army does with those wee red knives. || Recently, I turned 60 and even more recently I turned 62, that was a Bastard, I don’t even remember the 61. || Poor Michael Jackson and these sex allegations. As if it’s not bad enough him being a Jehova’s Witness, they’re accusing him of behaving like a catholic priest! || I used to have Mad Cow's disease, but I'm alright Nooooooooow. || Did your mother never tell you not to drink on an empty head? || Before you judge a man, walk a mile in his shoes. After that, who cares? He's a mile away and you've got his shoes. || Marriage is a wonderful invention: then again, so is a bicycle repair kit. || I love Los Angeles. It reinvents itself every two days. || A woman's mind is as complex as the contents of her handbag; even when you get to the bottom of it, there is always something at the bottom to surprise you! || When you involved in an accident and someone asks ""are you alright?"" Yes fine thanks, I'll just pick up my limbs and be off. || They should all join the brothers of the beige. The Beige sisters of premenstrual agony. || Chic Murray once told me he fell in the street, and a woman said to him, ""Did you fall?"" He said, ""No, I'm tryin' to break a bar of chocolate in my back pocket."" || Tread gently on anyone who looks at you sideways. || Roses are red, Violets are blue, I'm a schizophrenic, and so am I. || Suicide fucking bombing, there's a bright idea. Every time there's a bang, the world's a wanker short. || If Jesus was a Jew, how come he has a Mexican first name? || I always look skint. When I buy a Big Issue, people take it out of my hand and give me a pound. || Oh aye... my Father would thrash me every now and then. He'd talk while he did it too! He'd hit me and shout, ""Have ye had enough?"" Had enough? Whit kind of question is that? ""Why, Father, would another kick in the balls be out of the question?"" || And we took off-whoosh-into the night. Through the clouds, we hurtled up into the sky. And this man farted. I will never forget it as long as I live. Not only was it the worst fart, it was the longest. Maybe, it was the position he was in, he had squeezed his ass all up. But he was kinda leanin over and pointing his ass up toward me. And it made the strangest noise. It was like cloth tearing. || I worry about ridiculous things, you know, how does a guy who drives a snowplough get to work in the morning... That can keep me awake for days. || I'd never consciously left home to see a zombie movie. They were fine by me, but I had no intention of ever being in one. But I've been learning more about it as I've been doing interviews. I didn't even know there were specialist zombie magazines and clubs. I heard the other day that a radio station had asked people if they`d made preparations for an attack by zombies, and a staggering number of people replied yes! || When people say ""it's always the last place you look"". Of course it is. Why would you keep looking after you've found it? || When people say while watching a film ""did you see that?"". No tosser, I paid 10 quid to come to the cinema and stare at the fucking floor. || For years I thought the club's name was Partick Thistle Nil. || Beauty is only skin deep but ugly goes right to the fucking bone. || Heckling is an act of cowardice. If you want to speak, get up in front of the microphone and speak, don't sit in the dark hiding. It's easy to hide and shout and waste people's time. || I don't know why I should have to learn Algebra... I'm never likely to go there. || I don't have wild dogs chasing people with scripts away from my door. I get my share. I've done okay. But I usually do independent stuff because that's mostly what I'm offered. || I loathe hecklers. I haven't got a good syllable to say. When you come out of the club circuit and into the concert hall, they should be gone. There's an element of manners that should tell you that the ticket is dear and it's a different venue. || I started to draw desert islands. They were just rough, shapes in the middle of the page. Then I began drawing shapes within those shapes and I was amazed how quickly the islands got better. It took off from there. || I've always liked it here. Part of me is Irish. My family comes from the west coast, so whenever I come to Ireland I get a wee tingling in my heart that I'm where I belong. || American sex shops are the most bizarre. They sell these inflatable dolls, but they also sell just the head - supposedly for people to drive along the highway with. || I'm very big in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada and America. It's nice. I have a lovely life, and actually it pays better than the movies. Well, it doesn't pay better than Tom Cruise in the movies. But it pays better than I get. I get bus fare compared to these guys. || I'm now a Doctor of Letters. Most of them Fs and Bs. || We were watching this procession. It was fucking terrible and the crucifix was about 20 feet high coming around the corner. And my wee grandson says, ""who's that?"" I say, ""that's Jesus"". He says, ""baby Jesus?!"" I say, ""yeah, that's him"". He says, ""somebody killed baby Jesus!"" It was the most sincere religious cry. If Christians did that, I would believe them. ""what? The bastards killed Jesus!"" || It's very awkward to be kind of big in your own field. It limits what you're offered. People are swayed by the fact that you're a comedian or a musician or whatever they think you are. When it comes to choosing you, they get a bit shaky about offering you a different type of role. But I've really been very lucky. When you compare me to other comedians, I`ve been very fortunate. So you`ll get no complaints. || Sex therapist claims that the most effective way to arouse your man is to spend 10 minutes licking his ears! Personally I think its bollocks! || A mate of mine has just told me he's shagging his girlfriend and her twin, I said how can you tell them apart, he said ""her brothers got a moustache!"" || And then there was my mate who'd just been fitted with a brand new hearing aid. ""It's the best in the world"", he said. ""What type is it?"", I asked and he said ""ten past twelve"".  || To keep the fire burning brightly there's one easy rule: Keep the two logs together, near enough to keep each other warm and far enough apart-about a finger's breadth-for breathing room. Good fire, good marriage, same rule. || Outgrew the media... The negativity felt like a disease. || People who announce they are going to the toilet. Thanks that's an image I really didn't need. || I was brought up a Catholic, for that you get an ""A"" level in guilt. || Without arts programmes there's only reality TV, and reality TV needs the arts to show it what reality is. || Who the fuck are you? Get out of my house... and take that fucking bulldozer with you. || Apparently, women need to feel loved to have sex and men need to have sex to feel loved, so the basic act of continuing the species requires a lie from one of you. || We all know that at 5 in the morning the lanes behind hotels are full of children, especially wee blind ones who can't see fucking trucks coming. || You've made a happy man very old. || They reckon that Beer contains female hormones and I think they are right.

""No"" she replies ""its just regular porn you sick bastard"". || I don't believe in angels, no. But I do have a wee parking angel. It's on my dashboard and you wind it up. The wings flap and it's supposed to give you a parking space. It's worked so far. || People who ask ""Can I ask you a question?"". Didn't really give me a choice there, did you sunshine? || The scrotum - a design fault, excess elbow skin put in between mens legs to keep their balls so they don't have to hold them in their hand. although it didn't work! || Toblerones! It’s impossible to eat a fucking Toblerone without hurting yourself! || Sometimes i drift away...don't worry about that....Sometimes I don't drift back...but don't worry about that either! || 53 fucking virgins! The very thought of 53 fucking virgins, it’s a nightmare! It’s not a fucking present, it’s not a prize, it’s a punishment! Give me 2 fire-breathing whores any day of the week. I’m a slut man! || I loved Japan. I used to read a lot about it when I was a child. And I always wanted to go. And it was delightful. I absolutely loved it. What a smashing place. || I’m a big fan of the Mars Bar Diet. You don’t eat the Mars bar, you stick it up your arse and let a rottweiler chase you home. || If women are so bloody perfect at multitasking, how come they can't have a headache and sex at the same time? || Never run with scissors or other pointy objects. || Try to catch a trout and experience the glorious feeling of letting it go and seeing it swimming away. || Wear sturdy socks, learn to grow out of medium underwear and, if you must lie about your age, do it in the other direction. Tell people you're ninety-seven and they'll think you look fucking great. || I used to be a folk singer, but er I was… dreadful. I had a voice like a goose farting in the fog. || When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks, ""Has the bus come yet?"". If the bus came would I be standing here, Knobhead? || I became a welder. I was actually becoming an Engineer and I joined the wrong queue. And so I became a welder, without knowing what a welder was. || No children were abused in the making of this show. No one was hurt and no Islamic cartoons were used. You know, for those of you that can't take a fucking joke. || When something is ""new and improved!"". Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it."
Billy Crystal,"By the time a man is wise enough to watch his step, he's too old to go anywhere. || My granddaughter's birth has made me want to create things she will love. || Change is such hard work. || Consider the rose... The rose is the sweetest smelling flower of all, and it's the most beautiful because it's the most simple, right? But sometimes, you got to clip the rose. You got to cut the rose back, so something sweeter smelling and stronger, and even more beautiful, will grow in its place. || How do you find what's going to make everybody have this strange reaction in their bodies, this response that's sort of chemical and physical all at once - this noise and emotion that changes how you sit? A laugh is a weird sound, and when you get a couple thousand people making it at once, it's really strange. But when I can feel proud of myself for causing it, it's great. || Nobody is more truthful when he's acting than De Niro. || I can't be funny if my feet don't feel right. || Bambi, to a kid, was scary. || Gentlemen, start your egos. || When I've gotten criticism, it's that it's too long, too soft, didn't hit the government hard enough. Then when I do hit the government, they go, ""What's he doing hitting the government?"" || From the first time I saw Sid Caesar be funny I knew that's what I had to do. || Even when I was in school shows, in elementary school doing plays, I'd always go off book and start improvising. || I’m married – I’ve caught my limit. || When I buy a new book, I read the last page first. That way, in case I die before I finish, I know how it ends. || At some point I stopped stand-up because I didn't have something to say on a nightly basis. || Was at Royal Wedding but didn't go inside. Had same hat as Fergie's daughter. || I would even walk so it wouldn't look like we're together. Here I can hold his hand. || I had a dream that Connie Chung is doing a newscast about my death and they show a clip from Soap. || This guy was so large, he had his own climate. || I think I've far exceeded what I ever thought I could possibly do. I'm almost shocked that I'm still around after all of these years... and always grateful that I get another turn to do something. || Oh, I can't do it right now; I'm busy, I'm busy, too. || At night, I'll notice a thigh will just start aching. And this arm, and this... || Nothing can take the sting off the world's economic problems like watching millionaires present each other golden statues. || It's more important to look good than to feel good. || Did you ever reach a point in your life, where you say to yourself, 'This is the best I'm ever going to look, the best I'm ever going to feel, the best I'm ever going to do,' and it ain't that great? || To be good, you need to believe in what you're doing. || When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible. || I'm comfortable being old... being black... being Jewish. || You look mahvelous! || The reason we are together is because she puts lead in my shoes and doesn't let me fly off the earth. And it's always been that way. || To be or... Line! || Women need a reason to have sex. Men just need a place. || That's the thing about jazz: it's free flowing, it comes from your soul. || People thought this would be an award show - but we couldn't get anybody to open up the envelopes. I've been backstage at a lot of rock concerts, and I've never seen musicians run away from white powder before! || I've seen worse... It just so happens that your friend here is mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. || Well, the way things are going, aside from wheat and auto parts, America's biggest export is now the Oscar. || Never say famous last words, because they could be. || I fell in love with the right person, a person I know and who knows me. || Don't give up your power. || As a director and an actor, I encourage improvisation but in character and in the moment of what it is. || I had really good hearing and when you're scared it gets heightened so you hear scratching noises or something. || The house smelled of brisket and bourbon. That's the music I grew up on. || In high school, I was the class comedian as opposed to the class clown. The difference is the class clown is the guy who drops his pants at the football game, the class comedian is the guy who talked him into it."
Bo Burnham,"I actually wrestled in high school. I was only in one match, and I lost... my virginity. || It’s a show that I hope feels intimate in theme, but bigger in presentation. I love Tim Minchin, Bill Bailey and Hans Teeuwen and I’m trying to synthesise elements of theatre into my show a little bit more. I want it to be surprising and rich and fun to watch, and maybe a little confusing. It’ll be very loud and very quiet and very sad and very happy, with things that have you leaving the theatre going, ""what..."" And not ""what"" with a question mark; just ""what"", period. || I’m circumcised ‘cause I don’t cum from the hood. || I think that God might think I’m gay... what does he know anyway? || What do you call a kid with no arms and an eyepatch? Names. || Dick's and vagina's are like Coke and Pepsi, I strongly prefer one but my dad thinks they both taste the same. || In the distance, Bo saw a fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud of being called one in high school. || If Jesus can walk on water can he swim on land? || Roses are grey, Violets are a different shade of grey, Lets go chase cars! || What's a bag of chips divided by five, that's a Nike worker's meal. || And if ten percent of men are gay and twenty percent of men are Chinese, what are the odds that a men chosen at random spends his free time and mealtime while on his knees. || Those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones; or masturbate during the daytime. || My aunt used to say, slow and steady wins the race. She died in a fire. || Did you poop a virgin? ‘Cause that shit is tight. || I've been doin' drive-bys all of my life. Except the bullets are newspapers, the car is my bike. || I love your eyes and their bluish, brownish, greenish color. || Was Einstein's theory good? Relatively. || I'm Bo yo I'm the greatest rapper ever ever and I'll whether you weather, whether you think you better your not don't need a sweater I'm hot, I'm a really cool shorty who can really find your g-spot... what the fucks a g-spot. || She stood in line and got cut. Tried out, got cut. Loved art but the budget got cut. Then she got numb then she only felt when she knelt and cut! || Is there anything better than pussy? Yeah, a really good book. || Bono, if you want to help poor people, sell your tinted shades, you cunt. || I masturbate 'cause I'm the only one whose standards are low enough to fuck me. || We’re having a traditional Thanksgiving - turkey, mashed potatoes, hat buckles, smallpox, genocide, a blue corn moon, etc. || When life gets you down, make a comforter. || My ex-girlfriend had a really weird fetish. She used to like to dress up as herself and then act like a fucking bitch all the time. || And my friend is black, but I don't know what to call him. So I just call him Jamal Even though his name is Steve. || It's so ironic because gay bashers were the ones labeling me in high school. I try and write satire that's well-intentioned. But those intentions have to be hidden. It can't be completely clear and that's what makes it comedy. || Twitter is a lot like crystal meth, because it's really fun to do and Oprah's on it. || Laughter is the best medicine, y'know, besides medicine. || Even if he is your friend, never, ever call an Asian person. || Poetic talent is really easy to fake when thy sentences doth no fucking sense make. || Swallow bitch, there’s people starving in Africa. || Old peoples' skin sags because it's being pulled toward the underworld. || All you god damn dirty Catholics can cath-o-lick my balls. || You guys like impressions? Why? || How old is too old to stop believing in, like, the tooth fairy? Like 12? I've got a cousin who is 18... Yeah, still believes in gay marriage. || I’m a drunken midget with a loaded gun, a loaded gun. || My show is a little bit silly and a little bit pretentious. Like Shakespeare's willy. Or Noam Chomsky wearing a strap-on. || I’m going to take a Viagra and hit you all with a rock hard misdirection. || I’m gay for Jesus, fill me with your grace. Pour your love all over me, but please aim away from my face. || Do unto others as you would have them do to you, said the rapist. || Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. I’m thankful for all of you. I am not thankful for the pilgrims. Buckles should never be on hats. || Poverty. Racism. Isn’t it strange, only the homeless are begging for change? || For fifteen cents a day you can feed an African, they eat pennies. || My penis is so small that I have trouble finding it 'cause it's so greatly influenced by mechanical fluctuations in the fabric of space/time. And when I'm having intercourse with a woman, she can only know where my penis is or how fast it's moving 'cause it's small enough and light enough to be fully governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. || I met a bipolar bear. He laughed, cried, then wanted a threesome. || I know what you guys are thinking: Oh Bo, you tackle such taboo subjects, you know, is there anything off limits? Anything you don't find funny? Anything you think is too sacred to laugh at? And the truth is, there is... White people. I think we've been through enough...	 || I believe, firmly, that women are always right. Ah, I should actually rephrase that: I... don’t. || Where are all the sour patch parents? || Happy Thanksgiving! I broke into Best Buy and stole a copy of Pocahontas to celebrate. || No one entertains the thought that maybe god does not believe in you. || For every dollar that a man makes, a woman makes 70 cents. That doesn't make sense. That's not fair, the man's only left with 30. || I don’t watch you when you sleep. Surprisingly I don’t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. || If your belief is hateful towards people, I couldn’t respect that. || YouTube is a place for people to share their ideas. If by people you mean 13 year old girls and by ideas you mean how they love the Jonas Brothers. || I've always wanted a black girlfriend. Not as a joke, just so when we sixty-nine I can call it Yin-Yanging. || I wanted to be a physicist when I was younger, and I also wanted to be a comedian, but only one of those worked out, so I'd like to try to do both now in a bit that I call theoretical dick jokes. || My girlfriend, you know, she’s crazy. She’s a woman, and women are crazy. She hates it when I say the c-word. It’s so stupid… We’ll be watching, like, Spongebob or something, and I’ll be like, ‘c-word’ and she’ll be like, ‘His name is Squidward you dump cunt, now get out of my house.’ || My whole family thinks I'm gay, I guess it's always been that way. Maybe it's 'cause of the way that I walk, Makes them think I like... boys. || The average person has one fallopian tube. || Ya back home they call me the tie-dye shirt kid, well that and fagot. || Drugs kill, just like cancer. So don’t smoke... tumors. || Quotes are for dumb people who can't think of something intelligent to say on their own. || They say, if you want to know what a girl is going to look like, look at her mother, ya know. So I am so glad that I broke up with her, cuz uh, she would been uh, you know... dead. || What's that? My six song album entitled ""Bo Fo Sho"" is currently available on iTunes? With three songs that have never been heard on the internet? Uh, and if I try to pirate it for free I'll get AIDS? I would have guessed scurvy. Well, see you later ghost of Dr.Martin Luther King Jr. || If I had a dime for every time a homeless guy asked me for change, I'd still say no. || Women are like fingers and toes because they're easy to count on. || People ask me all the time, all the time, they say the same exact thing. They say, ""Bo, you’re an artist… how do we fix Africa?"" || When I tried to hit puberty I swung and I missed. || And an anteater plus a large hungry mutant ant? An ironic way to die. || There's a metal train that a mile long and at the very back end a lightning bolt struck her. How long til it reaches and kills the driver, provided that he's a good conductor? || I want you like Anne Frank wanted nobody to read her fucking diary. || Humour is often linked to shared experience. Like, a guy gets up and says, Have you noticed public restrooms have really inefficient hand-dryers? Oh my God, yes I have, hahaha, really good point, they should... fix that. It's good to know that somebody finally gets me! || The average penis length is 5-and-a-half inches, and finally, the average penis length of a man who Googles ""average penis length"" is 3-and-a-half inches. || People do complain about the way I act on stage... They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solecistic, self-contained, synonyms. || I’m in magazines full of model teens so far above you. So, read them and hate yourself and pay me to tell you I love you. And the parents always come along, cause their little girl is in love, and how could love be wrong? || I love you like a gay geneticist loves designer genes. || Bitches and hoes don't exist because the hoes know Bo's a feminist. || I'm constipated, couldn't give a shit. || When life give you lemons... you probably just found lemons. || Squaring numbers are just like women. If they’re under thirteen, just do them in your head. || Love is all about... whistles. || I always wanted to be a comedian and actor, I basically stumbled into the music medium, though. I'm OK, but that's about it. I like to think I'm good enough not to negatively affect the performance. || We know it’s not right. We know it’s not funny, but we’ll quit beating this dead horse when it stops spitting out money. But until then, we will repeat stuff. || I get more ass than a giant donkey stable. || What's a pirate minus the ship? Just a creative homeless guy. || Give me the bottle, I’ll chug two thirds, ‘cause you bitches know fractions speak louder than words. || I’m a stand up comic and I always sit and slouch, and I got my girlfriend pregnant on my sterile uncles pull-out couch. || I got a safe full of cherries ‘cause I pop it and lock it. || What's important is that you stay true to yourself. Because when you enter the real world, the most valuable thing you can bring is all your you-ness. The world doesn't need any more hot chicks or tough guys or smooth talkers - the world needs more you. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise. || I never said I was funny, OK, so stop staring at me... || Women are like puzzles because prior to 1920 neither had the right to vote. Puzzles still don't. || Then the challenge is, once you left brain it and build it, then when you’re on stage you have to know it so well that you can get lost in it. I don’t want to be onstage looking like a robot, I want to be at the end of the day very emotional and what feels like someone being up there rather than reciting things. That’s always the challenge, to analyze and then somehow lose yourself in something you absolutely know backwards and forwards. And nothing’s going to surprise you, but you have to be surprised by it and let it surprise you. || People give me money and I don’t know why, my real collection plate is an empty cup held by a homeless guy. || And if I die early the situation will be auto-erotic asphyxiation, I hate my life and it hates me back! || I stopped and I thought, ""What would Jesus do?"" So I didn’t exist. || And two balls minus one, six titles at the tour de France. || One out of forty-four U.S. Presidents can dunk. It’s Millard Filmore, you racists. || And if you made a factor tree of the factors that caused my girl to leave me you'd have a tree... Full of Asian porn."
Bob Hope,"The trees in Siberia are miles apart, that is why the dogs are so fast. || A sense of humor is good for you. Have you ever heard of a laughing hyena with heart burn? || If you watch a game, it's fun. If you play it, it's recreation. If you work at it, it's golf. || The audience was swell. They were so polite they covered their mouths when they yawned. || The older you get, the tougher it is to lose weight, because by then your body and your fat are really good friends. || I do benefits for all religions - I'd hate to blow the hereafter on a technicality. || Middle age is when your age starts to show around your middle. || Congratulations to whoever is finally booking music we love. It's going to get us out of the house after dark! || If I'm on the course and lightning starts, I get inside fast. If God wants to play through, let him. || Golf is my real profession - show business pays my greens fees. || That’s the time of your life when even your birthday suit needs pressing. || I ruined my hands in the ring… the referee kept stepping on them. || If you think golf is relaxing, you're not playing it right. || I'd give up golf if I didn't have so many sweaters. || Congress may be going home for the holidays soon. How can you beat a Christmas gift like that? || Television. That's where movies go when they die. || Four of us slept in the one bed. When it got cold, mother threw on another brother. || I see the Beatles have arrived from England. They were 40 pounds overweight - and that was just their hair. || When I was born, the doctor said to my mother, 'Congratulations. You have an eight-pound ham.' || I went to play golf and tried to shoot my age, but I shot my weight instead. || Thanks to our brave allies: you gallant Russian bear, you British everywhere. || I grew up with six brothers. That's how I learned to dance - waiting for the bathroom. || I'll tell 'ya how to stay young: Hang around with older people. || Virus is a Latin word used by doctors to mean 'your guess is as good as mine.' || I feel very humble, but I think I have the strength of character to fight it. || I love flying. I've been to almost as many places as my luggage. || Elvis is just a young, clean-cut American boy who does in public what everybody else does in private. || If you haven't got any charity in your heart, you have the worst kind of heart trouble. || Where else but in America could the women's liberation movement take off their bras, then go on TV to complain about their lack of support? || It's so cold here in Washington, D.C., that politicians have their hands in their own pockets. || I'm so old they've canceled my blood type. || As soon as the war ended, we located the one spot on earth that hadn't been touched by the war and blew it to hell. || Welcome to the Academy Awards - or as it`s known at my house, Passover. || Kids are wonderful, but I like mine barbecued. || I've always been in the right place and time. Of course, I steered myself there. || It's nights like this that drive men like me to women like you for nights like this. || I was lucky I wasn't a better boxer, or that's what I'd be now - a punchy ex-pug. || You know you're getting old when the candles cost more than the cake. || You've got to be rich to have a swing like that. || Your ignorance cramps my conversation. || No one party can fool all of the people all of the time; that's why we have two parties. || Don't tempt me, I can resist anything but temptation. || Middle age is when you still believe you'll feel better in the morning. || Personally, I never drink on Oscar nights, as it interferes with my suffering. || The stealth bomber is supposed to be a big deal. It flies in undetected, bombs, then flies away. Hell, I've been doing that all my life. || It gave dirty politics a bad name. || Kissing is like drinking tea with a tea strainer, you can never get enough. || I have performed for 12 presidents and entertained only six. || Dying is to be avoided because it can ruin your whole career. || The home videos aren't as good, but they are seeming to get better. || I ruined my hands in the ring ... the referee kept stepping on them. || I like to come to Washington, D.C., at least once a year. Why should my tax money travel more than I do? || I like to play in the low 70's. If it gets any hotter than that I'll stay in the bar! || The good news is that Jesus is coming back. The bad news is that he's really pissed off. || She said she was approaching forty, and I couldn't help wondering from what direction. || He plays just like a union man. He negotiates the final score. || My folks were English. They were too poor to be British. I still have a bit of British in me. In fact, my blood type is solid marmalade. || I have the perfect simplified tax form for government. Why don't they just print our money with a return address on it? || I have too much money invested in sweaters. || You never get tired unless you stop and take time for it. || Three of my stocks went off the financial page - into the help-wanted section. || Wine, women and song have been replaced by prune juice, a heating pad and the Gong Show. || Today's ballroom dances like the swim, the frug, the chicken and the monkey are really nervous disorders set to music. || I've got to watch myself these days. It's too exciting watching anyone else. || I led such a sheltered life I didn't go out with girls until I was almost four. || You know what a fan letter is - it's just an inky raspberry. || It sure has been a pleasure for us to broadcast for the sailors and soldiers; besides, its part of the National Defence Program to prepare our boys for anything. || Over the years, I have been subjected to many indignities, all for the sake of Art. If I ever catch him, I'm going to kill the guy. || Zsa Zsa Gabor got married as a one-off, and it was so successful she turned it into a series. || Bing Crosby and I weren't the types to go around kissing each other. We always had a light jab for each other. One of our stock lines used to be ""There's nothing I wouldn't do for Bing, and there's nothing he wouldn't do for me. And that's the way we go through life - doing nothing for each other! || Remember me? The Macaulay Culkin of 1927. || Tonight we set aside petty differences, forget old feuds and start new ones. || A James Cagney love scene is one where he lets the other guy live. || He hits the ball 130 yards and his jewelry goes 150. || I was lucky, you know, I always had a beautiful girl and the money was good. Although I would have done the whole thing over for, oh, perhaps half. || I need money. I have a staff of 30, and four houses, never mind the government, to support. || I don't know what people have against Jimmy Carter. He's done nothing. || A lot of people were surprised that Ford picked Nelson Rockefeller to run with him. After all, Rocky had tried to get the job of president three times himself. That's like asking Morris the Cat to watch your tuna salad. || You can always tell when a man's well-informed. His views are pretty much like yours. || I was on the way to my hotel, and I passed a hotel going in the opposite direction. || I left England when I was four because I found out I could never be King. || I've never wanted an Oscar, although they are reassuring to an actor who doesn't know how really great he is. || Culture is the ability to describe Jane Russell without moving your hands. || If I had my life to live over... I wouldn't have time. || Golf is a game that needlessly prolongs the lives of some of our most useless citizens. || A very, very religious man. Every time I eat a peanut, I feel immortal. || The last time I played golf with President Ford he hit a birdie – and an eagle, a moose, an elk, an aardvark... || The program is nearly over! I can feel the audience is still with me but if I run faster I can shake them off. || Baseball is a soap opera that plays out day after day, one that a lot of elderly women watch until the characters and the plot becomes a part of their life.

They're all running for the presidency. || Golf is a funny game. It's done much for health, and at the same time has ruined people by robbing them of their peace of mind.

That's when it's time for my nap. || My next door neighbor just had a pacemaker installed. They're still working the bugs out, though. Every time he makes love, my garage door opens. || People who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy. || A bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don't need it. || I love to go to Washington - if only to be near my money. || Golf is a hard game to figure. One day you will go out and slice it and shank it, hit into all the traps and miss every green. The next day you go out and, for no reason at all, you really stink. || I thought 'Deep Throat' was a movie about a giraffe. || They said I was worth $500 million. If I was worth that much, I wouldn't have visited Vietnam, I'd have sent for it. || My idea of Christmas, whether old-fashioned or modern, is very simple: loving others. Come to think of it, why do we have to wait for Christmas to do that? || When we recall the past, we usually find that it is the simplest things - not the great occasions - that in retrospect give off the greatest glow of happiness. || I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful. || I know I'm in England because this morning, my stomach got up two hours before I did and had a cup of tea! I've had so much tea, I slosh when I walk! You have to drink tea - I've tasted the coffee! || Ronald Reagan is not a typical politician because he doesn't know how to lie, cheat, and steal. He's always had an agent do that. || Bigamy is the only crime where two rites make a wrong. || When she started to play, Steinway came down personally and rubbed his name off the piano. || I don't know if the presidential candidates are running for the White House or Animal House. || If I have to lay an egg for my country, I'll do it. || I have a wonderful make-up crew. They're the same people restoring the Statue of Liberty. || They'll always be an England, even if it's in Hollywood. || When they asked Jack Benny to do something for the Actor's Orphanage - he shot both his parents and moved in. || My father told me all about the birds and the bees, the liar - I went steady with a woodpecker till I was twenty-one. || Most of the people who came for dancing lessons had Rumba ambitions and minuet bodies. || At the Academy Award Dinners all the actors and actresses in Hollywood gather around to see what someone else thinks about their acting besides their press agents. || The only thing chicken about Israel is their soup. || Isn't it fun to go out on the course and lie in the sun?"
Bob Newhart,"I can't remember the last live-action, non-animated Christmas movie. || Well, my career choice made a difference because I never would have met my wife, Jenny. I met her through comedian Buddy Hackett. He set us up on a blind date and then we got married. || Women are more emotional. They do get flustered. Which is not to say that men are better than they. It's simply the way it is. || You may not think I'm a sex symbol, but I became a father at the age of 48. Now young people think of me as a mini-folk hero because it's difficult for them to believe a man of my age is sexually active. || We presumed a certain intelligence on the audience, that they knew something about Sir Walter Raleigh, or about Abraham Lincoln, or the Wright Brothers. || Stammering is different than stuttering. Stutterers have trouble with the letters, while stammerers trip over entire parts of a sentence. We stammerers generally think of ourselves as very bright. My own private theory is that stammerers have so many ideas swirling around their brains at once that they can't get them all out, though I haven't found any scientific evidence to back that up. || The reason I'm a psychologist is based in part on my telephone routines. Much of my humor comes out of reaction to what other people are saying. A psychologist is a man who listens, who is sympathetic. || You shouldn't get too close to the truth, because then maybe you stop being funny. || Comedians are never really on vacation because you're always at attention... that antenna is always out there. || Laughter gives us distance.

And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'. || The first time I got up in front of an audience was terror, abject terror, which continued for another four or five years. There still is, a little bit. || This stammer got me a home in Beverly Hills, and I'm not about to screw with it now. || I am also huddling with creative advisers and studying the possibility of calling it The. || I still feel 30, except when I try to run. || Marriage and fatherhood heighten the disillusion that we all think we are born handy. We confidently believe that we can fix things around the house, as if it's part of the collective brain that was further enhanced by eighth-grade shop class. || My theory is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I tried to capitalized on the values that made the show work. I have to be nice to my guests at the hotel, as I had to do with my patients, even when they're bugging me. And the home-life part seemed to work. I don't want ever to ride the show into the ground. It has been good to me. || Continuing to do stand-up is always a challenge because the audiences and the environments in which you work very often differ. || I never had an aversion because I was active in the drama club. If I had that aversion I certainly wouldn't put myself in the position of being on stage. Of course, in the drama club you're hiding behind a character. || I'm one of those passengers who arrives at the airport five or six hours early so I can throw back a few drinks and muster up the courage to board the plane. Apparently I'm not alone because I've never been in an empty airport bar. I don't care what time you get there. Even at 8:00 a.m. you have to fight your way to the bar. At that hour, everyone drinks Bloody Marys so no one can tell it's booze- at least until they fall off their chair. || I've been told to speed up my delivery when I perform. But if I lose the stammer, I'm just another slightly amusing accountant. || I think everyone probably starts out sounding like someone else, but gradually you develop your own sound. || I feel more comfortable in comedy. || I didn't need the elf outfit to play an elf; I could just play an elf. || Every new routine I have ever written and performed probably occurred extemporaneously. Then after you have fleshed it out and tried it out in front of a number of audiences and it works, you put it down on paper. || Doormen are kind of invisible, people don't know their names. They just say, Thank you, or Good morning. I'd never thought about doormen before. They're a vanishing breed. More electronic doors are being introduced. || As an actor, you generally want to see the other actor's face. || I don't have a show anymore. I don't have a check coming in every week. This is important to me, I got to score a million tonight or it could all be over. || I like the humor to come out of character. When you're going for a joke, you're stuck out there if it doesn't work. There's nowhere to go. You've done the drum role and the cymbal clash and you're out on the end of the plank. || Television series are like the stock market. There's room for bears and bulls but no room for pigs. If we'd tried to milk another year out of the series, we'd have wound up with a pig. || The fact they're not there anymore is not a reflection on the actors. It's just that viewers didn't like it. You went, 'What the hell was that?' || The problem is that we live in an uptight country. Why don't we just laugh at ourselves? We are funny. Gays are funny. Straights are funny. Women are funny. Men are funny. We are all funny, and we all do funny things. Let's laugh about it. || There are a lot of questions I keep asking myself about why I do comedy. I guess I laugh to keep from crying. And I guess if you ever get me crying, I might not stop. This is the way I look at tragedy or else I'll cry. || When you're going for a joke, you're stuck out there if it doesn't work. There's nowhere to go. You've done the drum role and the cymbal clash and you're out on the end of the plank. || When I started out in 1960, I thought it might possibly last a couple of years. I never expected it to last 42. I take great satisfaction in that longevity. || Well I was much too practical to presume to have a career in comedy. || The only thing I have never done is a Broadway play. I'm not sure I have the discipline necessary to do a Broadway play. I know it holds a fascination for certain actors. || I've been a very lucky actor. || I'm very open to the up-and-comers. || I'm most proud of the longevity of my marriage, my kids, and my grandchildren. If you don't have that, you really don't have very much. || I was influenced by every comedian I ever saw work. That's the only way you learn how to do it. || I think there's a part, just a part of comedians, that is still childlike. || I think one reason for a successful marriage is laughter. I think laughter gets you through the rough moments in a marriage. || I really don't know what makes a comedian. I think it's a family background and environment. Yet if you put the same ingredients in another person, he may never utter a funny line. || I love portraying the totally indifferent person. || Don't be silly and don't waste your time. || All comedians are, in a way, anarchists. Our job is to make fun of the existing world. || It's getting harder and harder to differentiate between schizophrenics and people talking on a cell phone. It still brings me up short to walk by somebody who appears to be talking to themselves. || I think you should be a child for as long as you can. I have been successful for 74 years being able to do that. Don't rush into adulthood, it isn't all that much fun. || I don't know how many sacred cows there are today. I think there's a little confusion between humor and gross passing for humor. That's kind of regrettable. || Jack Benny was, without a doubt, the bravest comedian I have ever seen work. He wasn't afraid of silence. He would take as long as it took to tell the story. || I wouldn't want that man as my psychologist. || I think there are still words you can't use in family entertainment that you can use in a sitcom today. || One of the first things that you learn as a stand-up is, you're the boss. It's your stage, and don't screw with me because I'll make you look bad, which I had to do, because you wind up with drunks and loud people. || Funny is funny is funny. || I was not influenced by Jack Benny, and people have remarked on my timing and Jack's timing, but I don't think you can teach timing. It's something you hear in your head. || I don't have a stack of scripts. || I am a minimalist. I like saying the most with the least. || It was a decision to work clean. I just prefer to work that way. I have no problem with comedians who don't work that way. There was a temptation in the early '70s to reconsider. I decided against it. || I've done more than I thought I was ever going to do. I've had a very long and very satisfying career. || I was never a Certified Public Accountant. I just had a degree in accounting. It would require passing a test, which I would not have been able to do. || All I can say about life is, 'Oh God, enjoy it!' || As far as gambling, just ask any of the dealers in the Las Vegas casinos and they'll tell you that woman can't play blackjack. They can't add up the cards fast enough. || My friends were getting married, buying houses, buying cars, and I wasn't doing anything. There was the point was I talk to myself to you, every screw up nature, look at what you've done with your life. But there was always something on the horizon, that was holding, maybe, you know, this will make you different. || There's a lot of cynicism. Let's really enjoy Christmas, with all that's going on in the world. || You do a clean show and it's over and the audience have enjoyed themselves and you've enjoyed yourself, and you haven't had to resort to shock. || I kind of do it in my head, then I'll try pieces of it on stage and if it looks promising, I'll put it together. || The best advice I could give someone trying to get into the comedy field is to take advantage of every opportunity you have to work to hone your skills. || You should have a value system. You can win if you stick with your value system. || Sometimes you forget you're famous. You wonder, Why is that person staring at me? || I couldn't play off people that I don't personally like. || Humor's a weapon if you want to make it one. || I don't want to find the secret. I'm afraid all the joy will go out of it if I find the secret. || In today's world, you would call my father mostly unaccessible. I'm not sure that isn't true of most fathers at that time. He went through the Depression. I don't know what that would have done to my psyche. || One of the first things you ever learn as a stand-up is don't show fear. || The giant superstars are people whose talent is so enormous that their death wish can't destroy it. || There's gratification in making somebody laugh. It's a wonderful sound. I find myself, to this day, doing it, wanting to make people laugh. || You never know when you'll come upon something and it's going to be fodder for new material."
Bob Saget,"At the end of the day it's the end of the day. || I am fucked up. I apologize from the bottom of my cock. I'm sorry for my ass and my sack. It's my fault, my bad. Who's your daddy? Say my name, look me in the eye. || Wise men say, only fools rush in. Wise men are so slow. || Behind every great man in prison is another great man in prison. || I have a food party trick. Get some whipped cream or butter, put it on a table, and say, “Everybody ready? This is my trick.” Then I’ll wipe whatever white substance it is all over my mouth and go, “I got the job! I can’t believe I got the job!” That’s my party trick. It’s so stupid, but I’ll still do it. || Jon Lovitz. Jon, your act is like masturbation: you're the only one who enjoys it, and you should be arrested for doing it in public. || Aristotle said, ""Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies."" Isn't that a three-way? || I have the brain of a German Shepard and the body of 16-year-old boy. They’re both in my car and I want you to see them. || Ahhh, where is my face?! I lost so much face on that show, I don't even exist anymore! || Beautiful clear day in Beverly Hills. The sweet smell of Botox is in the air. || I don't call her my middle child, I call her my center child, Because the world revolves around her. || A good way to keep your relationship together is not to scream in terror when you see your partner naked. || It think acceptance levels sort of swings back and forth. Like in the 60's there was a lot more freedom with sex that doesn't exist today. Language has gotten pushed a bit farther and violence is way far out. || If I ever die, I want it to be cause I got hit by a car saving a kid. || My mom just told me it's impossible to know what's going to happen in life. Except with breakfast, cause she eats the same thing every day. || I like to approach every day like it's my first, so this morning when I woke up I covered my body with red gelatin. || Around comics, I've always been known for, oh, that's not dirty, this is dirty. || Full House was a show that was done for ten-year-olds. The critics hated it. They said terrible, terrible things about it. But it should have been reviewed by ten-year-olds. That's who it was made for. They loved it. And if they loved it, great. Why the hell does a fifty-year-old guy working at a big newspaper have to tell me I'm a piece of crap? || That would be a good public service announcement for Nickelodeon: ""Hi, this is Bob Saget. Don't fuck that shit. Stay in school. And read!"" || If you don't wake up every day happy, change something. || Think well of yourself and others will too. Unless those others are in government, banking, or show business. || I wouldn't hurt a flea. I'd finger a spider though. || The greatness of a man is only measured by his urologist. || Apparently my street has a leaf blower gang who tag team all day, so the sounds of the leaf blower are forever blowing from dawn to dusk. || My girlfriend just told me I am one of the smartest people she knows. I told her, ""You need to meet other people."" || Every day you need to look yourself in the mirror and say, 'Don't be talking to yourself in the mirror today, you're alone in your house.' || My mom told me she thinks a man in the market felt her up today. I asked, ""Where did he touch you?"" She said, ""On my knee, Bobby."" || It's a new day: Full of promise and love. The only thing that can take away that great feeling is - reading the news or speaking to people. || Life can be really hard some times but its better than being a butterfly where you only live a month. || They were always very sweet girls. There was really no way to be cynical about them. That's why people always called it ""The Michelle Show."" || I have New Age friends who gave their little girl a toolbox of plastic tools. They were horrified later that night when they came into her room and found out she was putting the hammer to bed. || My humor was kind of from my dad and all the stuff that we went through, which was a lot of death. My humor was an escape. || I think comedy is on an organic upsurge right now because when I started, it was 1978 at The Comedy Store and Letterman had just stopped emceeing his morning show. || I don't like to drink alone 'cause there's nobody to fight with. || Fuck you all and suck my hundred million dollar cock! || Now people want what the movie was about, which is violent comedy. And that's really what The Aristocrats is based on - what will a family do out of desperation. || Saw a man in Whole Foods yelling at his son, ""What are you doing?! You know I don't eat bread!!"" Is there such a thing as health food abuse? || A guy recently came up to me and said, ""Bob, you are the shit."" I said ""Thank you for adding the word 'the.'"" || Kindness isn't just a virtue, its a necessity. || My book editor asked me if I wanted an extension and I told him, it's okay, I'm happy with the length of my penis. || Today is a brand new day. A day of change, of promise, of creativity, of kindness, and of love. I'm going back to bed. || My father once told me, and it's stuck with me to this day: ""As you walk through life, every time you fart it pushes you forward."" || I'm glad 'bad ass' doesn't mean 'bad' 'ass.' || Found a bunch of old shower caps in my house. Was gonna throw them out but realized they make excellent porta potties for long road trips. || One of the first things I said when I signed on for the show was ""No hugs!"" Full House was all based on hugs. || My wife is a saint. She’s Gandhi. She walks around in diapers and won’t eat. || 25, 30 years ago, that meant something, they were making some money. And they were doing all sorts of comedy, screaming at the audience, basically crowd control. And then there was the whole urban comedy scene. || The secret to raising children is to love them... And teach them to operate in a way you can tolerate them the best. || Today is the first day of the rest of your life. And if that doesn't work out for you, Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life... || Just went to the gym and worked on every body part. Four people slapped me. || There are no ""I's"" in ""we"" but there are two ""i's"" in ""Wii."" || If someone sprays windex in your food it can give you diarrhea. But once you wipe it off your windows, you're fine. || Nobody can tell me what I can or can't do, except they can. || It's so nice to share a day as beautiful as this one with hundreds of thousands of reckless drivers. || I have an ex-wife, can you tell - Cock shit fuck - but... I have a wonderful ex-wife, I really do. She's a great mom, and she's doing great. She's fuckin' rich - that's hey boyfriend's name. || When someone you love is hurting, if it was possible, you'd want to take their pain for them. But do I really want cramps and sore boobs? || It's never good to change yourself for someone else. Unless you really suck. || My haircutter figured out I whine less if I'm under general anesthesia. I just hope when I awaken they haven't given me a Brazilian wax. || Just went to a lovely Catholic wedding. I need a drink. They didn't even offer us water. Well they did, but it was Holy water. || What do you do if you're in the car and your girlfriend touches your crotch then asks you to remind her ""to get kitchen scissors?"" || No one gets a free ride. Except maybe bus drivers. || Sundays are a good day to look at the limitless possibilities of the week ahead. The key is to prolong that feeling by not reading the news. || Sometimes I wish I hadn't said something foolish. It is then that I realize the power of mime. || As time goes on, the more I value doctors and plumbers. Doctors a little more. I can fix my own toilet but I still can't operate on myself. || Most people argue over who's right, not about what the truth is. || Words matter. Especially if you're kicking someone's ass in words with friends. || Valuable people are undervalued. || I'm a believer that when one door closes another one opens. But why does the one opening always hit me full-speed-knob-first into my nuts? || I'm completely changing my diet. My nutritionist recommends I must now stop eating food I have already eliminated. || I was on Entourage last week smoking a bong and making out with hookers and I did show them that before, cause it wasn't a hard 'r' cause a lot of people are watching that show that they know, not my little one - she's 12, but very sophisticated so it's an unusual case. || There was this whole middle time that only Chris Rock came out of, you know, 10 years ago it was Chris and a few other people, but that's about it. Chris is in a class of his own; I don't see another comedian who I put in high regard as him. || Everyone I love I pay. || You learn who your friends are when you find out who will lie for you. || They say, ""Keep your enemies closer."" But what if you live with them? || When you have a good time there is no time. || My dad told me if I was ever intimidated by anyone, just picture them with their clothes off. He said that's how he dealt with my mom. || Ladies, apologies, but isn't 'vintage' just used stuff? || If you're hanging out with two negative people, do they equal one positive person? || It's okay to get stoned, as long as its not by other people. || ""The videos are hysterical. Almost matching Bob Saget's creative introductions to them"". Actually, my parents said that. But then they also once said, ""We're very disappointed in you, Bob."" They said that, but that was before I had this show. || If you're a host of a video show and you're on the cleanest show on television for eight years, people want to say, 'Well, that's what that person does.' That was the dilemma for me, career-wise. || I was going to do a big radio show, and I said to my driver, 'Radio can wait, take me to the Full House house.' It literally was a drive-by. I photobombed the Full House house yesterday. I took like 20 pictures because I thought I didn't look good in any of these - you can't see the house! You gotta really show that that's the house! || The nature of comedy is ""just do it"". But I think what's interesting about it is this joke has been around and why. And it's just saying what's wrong and how wrong can you be if you say it. || It's 103 comedians, or however many it is, and how would everyone tell it. It's enough people of substance that it makes you think of the people who aren't there that are alive. || I'm doing 5000 seat theaters and audiences are going nuts, it's fantastic and it makes me very happy. I'm dirty, but not like this; I just do comedy that I find funny. I'm working on a new tv show for cable and it's not set up yet. || I have three kids, the oldest is 18 and her friends are going to see it The Aristocrats because they told her they're going to see it, especially her guy friends. || I have a feeling I'm going to wake up one day and say ""I can't do dirty stuff anymore, I want to go all clean"". I'll do clean stuff too, I like to entertain people. Then they egged me on; we shot it at The Laugh Factory. || I think when you dissect a joke too much, you have ruined whatever there is in comedy. || I don't roll like that but I've never been with a hooker either. Yeah, that's good to say in an interview cause I feel bad a little because people grew up watching me and that's a little disturbing. || I don't like the negative of reality tv - the ""you're no good, so you have to leave, I choose you, but I thought you really loved me"". It's all about how bad people are and I just hate that. I like Pimp my Ride where someone is helping somebody. || Met a girl the other nite and told her- Before you can be with someone you have to know the value of yourself. So does $200 seem reasonable? || Some dead people said smart stuff. || This woman woke up to see me and John Stamos banging on her windows. She must have thought she died and went to sitcom hell. || Some guys shave it up. Um, Dave Coulier from Full House shaves his balls. Tell you friends, tell everybody. Tell the world. Tell the world. Joey shaves his balls. I've said it. On television. || Kids, do not fuck that shit; you'll get an infection. || I would actually go up during those; it was kind of scary for the people at first and then they were happy. Now, there's a couple amazing people out on the road like Pablo Francisco and Dane Cook is out there and they're building a huge audience with the craft of stand up comedy. || The squirrel in my yard really knows his way around the neighborhood. || If 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,' how do you explain zombies? || I love watching people get hit in the crotch. But only if they get back up. If their teeth are bleeding, if they're really hurt, if an ambulance has to come, I'm not laughing. || I can't do negative, needy, or narcissistic anymore. Oh wait, I can still do the last one, aw nuts. || I just tied a string around my penis so I don't forget it. || It's smart to marry your yoga teacher so when you get divorced you know how to go down on yourself. || The Comedy Store - all three rooms were filled with 800 people in the room. And during that time, all these guys and some women, but mostly guys who weren't funny were doing stand up for a living; they weren't accountants, they were making $30-$50 grand a year on the road, or more. || Oil is sixty dollars a barrel. There are terrorists everywhere. We have a catastrophe in our world every ten minutes. I don't know how anybody's getting through anything. Right now, people just need to be entertained. || Marijuana is not a drug! I used to suck dick for coke! You ever suck dick for marijuana? || What I have now are good problems of trying to decide and what I really want to do is good work next. My phone's ringing a lot more and I've got nine lines so when it doesn't ring, it's very frustrating. || I think Desperate Housewives is a pretty good show, I watch it, I like it and I don't love reality tv that much. I do watch some, I've got three daughters so we'll watch the good stuff, the fun stuff. || It was a job; the video show was a job; you don't tell the Aristocrats joke at 8 o'clock at night on network tv, it would be funny though. But those guys know I like dirty stuff, I like clean stuff too. || Yet there are some people - Steve Allen would dissect comedy forever; he's a really funny guy, but he would love talking about comedy. I'm doing it right now and you all seem bored. || You can cauterize your asshole shut, you understand me? And then when you fart, it has nowhere to go. I'm not fuckin' around, it goes into your body and into your heart and you have a fart attack, is what you have. And you will die from that, and your last breath will be a burp and it will smell like shit. || Because I am a fuckin' genius... according to my gynecologist, who said ""That clitoris is gigantic."" || Even John's dick has a great hairline. On ""Full House,"" John's dick had a mullet. || A lot of people ask me what my favorite episode of ""Full House"" was, I always tell them: it was the last one! || Jared, don't fuck a goat. You hear me, son? Because a goat - no, listen. No, fuckin' listen. Put it on receive, dude. A goat... why am I attacking you? I have no idea. It's a mode of choice. But a goat will eat a tin can, they'll eat fuckin' junk. They'll chew it up. Have you ever watched 'em? They eat shit. And they will eat your junk right off, Jared. And you will be junkless. And you will have nothing, you'll have like a tit - a tin plate, where your - a tit plate. You'll have a nipple where your dick was, and you will be fucked. || Norm is such a horrible gambler, he bet Jon Lovitz would be funny tonight. || I thought my girlfriend told me I was her soul mate, but what she said was 'cell mate.' || Some people rely on rumors and gossip because they are devoid of any original thought. || I just had a pedicure. My feet are soft like a baby's behind. If his ass was covered in calluses. || What I've learned about comedy people is that they're defined by the harshest level they've been to, their personal Auschwitz. || Some people say kissing is more intimate than sex... I guess, if you’re kissing someone’s butt hole. || John and I were gay together once... Wait, that's not true. He was gay and I just laid there. Thank you, John, for giving me your heiny last night. || If you laugh at that, you lower the bar, and I will limbo under it because I am a fucked-up guy! || Full House gave me Tourette's. We would be on the set, and, action! ""Okay, Michelle, you can't have a horse in the house."" and, cut! ""Cock shit fuck!"" || When you're famous, you're always famous. It doesn't go away. || I'm going to be fifty this year. Soon I'm going to meet somebody around my own age, and she's going to be smart and beautiful, and I'm going to date her daughter. || They go nuts. They flash me their boobs. And that's just the guys. || You know, it's really rude to yell at your cock in front of people, and I apologize. || My dad's like, ""If your mom and I are having sex and we videotape it and she falls out of bed funny, can I win ten-thousand dollars?"" || I've had a pilot every single year that didn't sell for the past four years, that'll smack you in the back of the head. I had a really good one last year; I wouldn't have done the play in New York if I had gotten that one. || People do what they do to each other and they feed on it. || And turkeys are a bird. A very nervous bird. You’d be nervous too if you knew that one day you’d get your head cut off and... filled with stuffing. || Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. I assumed you were a guy, you might have female parts. I don't know per-say. And I don't mean to call it a per-say, but it might be... with sack. || Concerned we're in a time where politicians can't even fake sincerity. Aren't they supposed to be good at that? || The other day my twelve-year-old says to me, ""I don't feel like I'm with you right now. You're in the car with me, you're checking your e-mail, you're not listening to me, I don't feel like I'm with you."" And I say, ""You know what? That was your mother's gripe, too. And she was right. And you're also correct."" When you cop to something, you get to the next level. In this case, the next level is: I just learned something from my twelve-year-old. || If you go with Marshall McLuhan's theory that the medium is the message, as soon as you're hosting a blooper show, you're done. || I love anybody funny - even people who are bastards, who are evil people, the meanest people you can imagine, even if they treat me horrifically or they treat people like shit - just because they're funny. Being funny is a jewel in the crown of life. || I just did a play in New York which has been my best experience that I've had for maybe ever. It was Paul Weitz's play called Privilege and I was in New York for three months. || They say the measure of a man is judged by the company he keeps. I'm fucked. || Stop It, stop lighting your butthol on fire, and everybody listen to me. If you light your ass on fire, I hope you have boxers or a filter of somekind, because if your a bareass person. Not a lot of people have done this. Stop It. This is why. You can cauterize your asshole shut, so when you fart it has nowhere to go and you can have a fart attack. || Friend of mine just told me he used to be a bad alcoholic. I calmed him down. Told him he was a good alcoholic just a horrible drinker. || Norm MacDonald. Norm, you're the funniest man I know. Because these are the other people that I know. || I'm a lucky bastard. You know it and I know it. || Paul Riser tells it in an interesting way; he dissects it and tells the structure, you know, 'you don't mention that part here.' But that's what's interesting about it and the people who are absent are interesting too. || So, fuck that shit. That's... eww. Who came up with that? ""Fuck that shit."" No thanks, I'm good. Do not - Kids, don't fuck that shit. You'll get an infection. You listen to me, I'm a doctor and a pharmacist and a 9-1-1 operator. I know what the fuck I'm doing. Don't fuck that shit. That would be a good public service announcement for Nickelodeon. ""Hi, this is Bob Saget. Don't fuck that shit. Stay in school. And read."" || A lot of the comedians don't even tell the joke. Like only three tell the joke, the rest of them dissect it. || I can't go back now. I've done it. I've gone and done it. || I love telling stories and acting and entertaining people. I don't want to make fun of people. || My favorite Dylan song? I think it's 'Just Like a Woman.' It always makes me cry. || I'm fortunate to know a lot of incredibly talented people, and they all want to be a penguin. || You can talk about things indirectly, but if you want to talk how people really talk, you have to talk R-rated. I mean I've got three incredibly intelligent daughters, but when you get mad, you get mad and you talk like people talk. When a normal 17-year-old girl storms out of the house or 15-year-old boy is mad at his mom or dad, they're not talking the way people talk on TV. Unless it's cable. || Words matter. Especially ones with four letters."
Bobby Slayton,"You know who doesn't get the death penalty? Crazy people. That’s a defense in America. ""My client’s crazy. He doesn’t know what he did."" Fine, then he doesn't know we’re gonna kill him. If a guy's that retard, you put him the electric chair and tell him it’s a ride. || If you can't laugh at yourself, make fun of other people. || A lot of these kids have no fathers, and they want to be gangsters. They don't believe in God and have no faith in anything but their own instincts. Boxing provides a way for them to express themselves in a positive way, and I'm happy to be able to help them. || I don’t get the point of drug commercials. Like the thing with the frying pan and the egg. “This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?” Yeah, do I get bacon with this? || We have blacks and whites, Jews and Arabs, Serbs and Croats, and Filipinos and Vietnamese here. At the end of the day, everyone is each other's brother. || I had a porn star in the audience the other night, and she really doesn’t like performing sex scenes. She says, “I fake my orgasms. I can’t wait for this to get off me. And all I can think about is getting paid and having dinner later.” I said, “Wow! I’m married to a porn star!” || Women don’t have dicks and they don’t want dicks. That amateur psychology crap that women want penises. And they certainly don’t want testicles. Because you know no women in her right mind is going to carry around a bag that she can’t put stuff in. || I offend everybody."
Bobcat Goldthwait,"For a day and a half, the National Guard was here, and they didn't go to work. Do you remember why? No bullets. I found it really hard to believe that that was the same crackerjack unit that Dan Quayle once belonged to. || If you ever see me at a boat show or at a car show, blow my head off. || Don't hoo, hoo, hoo me. There's a fine line between hoo, hoo, hoo and hiel, hiel, hiel. || Fame is like a big eraser. It's strange, now that I'm famous. In my parents' opinion, all the shitty things - all the wreckage of my past - is erased. Now it's like I was never the kid who got arrested. Now I'm a wonderful son. || That movie looks so bad, I can't believe I wasn't in it. || They can't even put the name in TV Guide. || When I was a baby I had no teeth. I couldn't get a job and I couldn't eat meat. || I retired from acting the same time they stopped hiring me. But following my own thing of making these small indie movies has been the happiest I've ever been. || You can't blame the President for everything that's wrong with this country. That's like blaming Ronald McDonald if you get a bad cheeseburger. || If you ever see me getting beaten by the police, put down the video camera and come help me! || America is one of the finest countries anyone ever stole. || Well, I’m an uncle now ... don’t know if I’m a good one. My nephew asked me the difference between a hamster and a gerbil and I told him I thought there was more dark meat on a gerbil. || I think there are only three things America will be known for 2,000 years from now when they study this civilization: the Constitution, jazz music, and baseball. || I'm against gun control. It's not that I like guns, it's just that allowing Americans to have guns will increase the chances that a bunch of rednecks will blow each other's heads off."
Bonnie McFarlane,"When I first started doing stand-up, I would be so nervous that I would just binge drink really heavily right before my sets, and as you can imagine, that had its drawbacks. But now I'm a professional, so I pace myself throughout the day. || I jog, actually; I go at night. A lot of women, they don't like to go jogging alone at night. They're afraid they might get accosted. I go naked. That way, if there are any perverts around, they think I'm already being chased. || Babies: they're not just for Puerto Ricans anymore. || Intellectually, I think everyone really knows that women are funny, but it’s a weird thing that people keep trotting out. || Well I grew up in Canada in a really small town. We didn't have running water for a long time and we didn't have TV. Then when we did get TV we only had one channel. || I’ve always wanted to be a writer. Always been very creative. I always laughed at things that the rest of my family would sort of get angry, like not understand. || I don’t think cops should wear mirrored sunglasses; the whole time the guy was chewing me out, all I could think was ""I should cut my bangs."" || One of my favorite sketches, and a popular comedy formula, is to put someone with a mental handicap in some kind of unlikely situation. For example: The retarded gynecologist, the retarded Jesus, the retarded Osama Bin Laden. It works. It's funny. Inappropriate? I dunno. I feel like I'm a pretty good judge of what crosses the line of good taste being that I am retarded. Socially perhaps, but severly retarded. || I think it’s creepy if a guy says, ""I would never hit a girl."" Cause that should go without saying. That’s like if you ever heard a guy go, ""I would never crap in a hot tub."" || When you’re pregnant, people feel like they can come up and give you unsolicited advice. When I was nine months pregnant, this one woman came up and she said, ""I have one word for you: epidural."" And I was like, ""Oh my God, thanks. But we already picked a name."" || I saw the head of NOW - National Organization of Women - saying that women still only make 70 cents on the dollar to every man. I’m not sure I’m going to believe that. Women are notoriously bad at math. || My neighbor says being gay is biological. And the reason she gives is she says, “I knew I was gay since I was five years old.” Five. I don’t know about you, but when I was five, I’d fuck a guy, fuck a girl, fuck a guy, fuck a girl. I was all over the map. I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. I didn’t figure that out until I was nine. || I know environmentalists exist, but whenever I see a guy on a bike, I don't think, 'Oh, sweet, there goes an environmentalist.' I'm always like, 'That poor sucker got a DUI.' || Is being earnest important? I always think it's kind of embarrassing. || Never hit a baby, even if they start it. || If you really are superior, you don't go around saying you're superior - unless you're Jewish. || Such a politically correct time. I used to do a lot of racial material, but then people would think I was a racist and I'm not - anymore. || I guess the biggest issue my husband and I are going to have is how do we raise the baby… because he’s Jewish and I’m Protestant and the baby’s father is Catholic. || As for that word... Retard. I tried to get my sister to start calling her friends retard, you know, to take the word back. Own the power. They could be like, ""Yo, Tardo!"" ""Hey, Retard, what up?"" to one another. But if a non-retarded person said it, they'd get pissed, ""No, thas our word!"" But it's a complicated game of irony and my sister doesn't play that shit. She refuses to use the word retard for fear she might hurt someone's feelings. Me, I'm not so nice. || When I first got into this biz called show, I decided I was going to change my name, make it more Hollywood. And you know how you do that? You take your middle name and the first street that you ever lived on. So when I first started, I actually went by Sue Rural Route 2. || I got a new diaphragm - well, it's new to me. || I could never be a lesbian because I have a really good sense of humor. || Cocaine is yucky. I did it once: I was at a party; I was bored. I was like, 'Alright, I'll do a line.' Then I was just bored longer. || Sometimes when I’m bored, I like to people watch. And I got to a touristy area and I play this game I just made up. I call it ""Lesbian or Midwestern?"" || My sister might be dumb, but that doesn't make her all that different from the rest of us. She's just like any other American. Except she's Canadian. And retarded. || My sister loves dirty comedy. She'll laugh hysterically at every foul word, every titillating premise, every fart noise and every faggot impression. It will come as no surprise then, when I tell you that her favorite comic is Janeane Garofalo. She thinks she's really cool. Her favorite movie moment of all time is that scene in ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" when Janeane's character, on roller skates, is pulled down the street by a couple of dogs. Regardless of where you are on the whole alternative comedy debate, you gotta admit, that shit was funny. || I've been called a racist before, and let me tell you something - that is harsh. That's a really ugly thing to call someone. That's like being called a Mexican. || Another time we watched this morose, spiky-haired open miker do his entire set laying down on the stage. I guess it was his way of saying, ""Fuck standup."" From his supine position he mostly did dumb puns. After a couple of minutes my sister turned to me and threw her hands in the air, ""I don't get it!"" || Once my sister busted a nut watching a headliner I worked with. He closed his set by miming the insertion of a tampon up his asshole. I don't recall the exact joke. After his set my sister made a beeline for him, running roughshod over the other more delicate comedy groupies. She gushed about his tampon bit and then told him he should get an actual tampon and really stick it up there. And then she laughed like crazy. I thought it was a good note. || I still don't really know what my style is. I like a lot of different kinds of comedy, I like watching it and I like being inventive and original. That's the problem with doing a longer set - you can't do every joke that you have because some stuff contradicts other stuff. Even when you know that the audience knows that you're joking and it's not true, you still can't do a joke about your family dying and then later talk about your Mom. I mean you want to keep some kind of cohesive order going. || There's no such thing as a feminist - just women who pay for their own breast implants. || It's interesting, once I have convinced people that, yes, I have a sister with a mental disability, the retard jokes really dry up, so I'm not sure how much retard humor is really going on out there, but I imagine there's a lot because it's a pretty safe group to make fun of. It's not like the Retards of America are gonna rise up and organize a protest. They're not gonna write letters. They only just recently got the Supreme Court to stop executing them. || My sister would've liked to have been a comic. She had an act that she would do for me sometimes. But of course, she didn't become a standup comedian because she's kind of a big talker. Doesn't do a whole lot of the things she says she will. Like go to the moon. The truth is if she had done it, she would be so fucking famous right now. Her act was simply a stream of obscenities and giggling. Can you imagine? A retarded chick just standing on stage swearing and giggling? || I love my hunting dog. I loved my hunting dog - I'm not very good at hunting. || If you enjoy shaming people, I suggest dentistry as a profession. || I get called ""sweetheart"" a lot by guys. You know a lot of women take offense at that, but when you've been called ""cunt"" enough times, it kind of takes the sting out of ""sweetheart"". || Just a tip if you have a big event to go to or an important meeting, if you cry enough your face swells up giving you a temporary ""lift"". || I don't know why I try to talk about politics publicly when I have no idea what I'm talking about. I feel like I should be auditioning for 'The View.' || I grew up in a mixed religious household. And it was volatile. My dad’s atheist, my mom’s agnostic. Just constant fighting. ""There’s no God!"" ""There might be!"" || You know, women are burdened with all this other crap all the time, like looking good. You need to be really superhuman to be successful as a woman. || But it’s like guys are thinking, ""I don't want to fuck her, what is she doing on my television?"" || I don't want to brag, but I do speak Pig Latin; I mean, I'm not fluent, but I'm sure if I ever went there, I could get by. || My sister is also retarded. Across the board. She's a one hundred per cent, honest to goodness, born that way retard. I learned a long time ago that if you're going to tell a story about your retarded sister, you need to mention she's retarded right off the bat or inevitably, at the end of the story, someone will say, ""What... is she, retarded?"" And then you have to go, ""Uh... yeah, she is."" Followed by a lengthy, awkward silence. || My sister likes comedy. And she likes it a little mean sometimes. She'll point out your fat ass or ask if you're wearing a wig. She knows how to dish it out, too. || When one door closes another door opens. Usually a refrigerator. || I've always dated Jewish men, and I don't know why. What am I saying? I know exactly why that is - it's because I have a really little vagina."
Brad Stine,"I suffer from two phobias: 1) Phobia-Phobia, the fear that you're unable to get scared, and 2) Xylophataquieopiaphobia, the fear of not pronouncing words correctly. || Because when the Creator of matter, tell you you matter, then you have a purpose and then you have self-esteem. || People don't realize, or maybe they've forgotten, that there was a time in history when standup comedy wasn't something that you had to hide your kids' ears from. || We should have a way of telling people they have bad breath without hurting their feelings. ""Well, I'm bored. Let's go brush our teeth."" Or, ""I've got to make a phone call. Hold this gum in your mouth."" || God is a crutch? Yeah, well, not believing in God is a coma. || The way to stop political correctness is to not do it. If someone says, ""You offended me"" then you say ""I don’t care!"" If they’re offended by the truth, that’s their issue! || If the truth conflicts with my beliefs, I change my beliefs. || You’re not a bunch of people lock-stepped with the politically correct. Oh no! Don’t shoot the animals! They might get their feelings hurt! || Who is more irrational? A man who believes in a God he doesn't see, or a man who's offended by a God he doesn't believe in? || If you can't say something nice... about an overrated, ungrateful European nation that would have been wiped off the face of the earth twice in the twentieth century if it weren't for the United States and which has given nothing to the culture in the past two hundred years but whine and cheese, both of which are made better in California, then don't say anything at all! || The wussification of America is killing us by teaching us to censor ourselves from what we believe. That’s why I want to see political correctness die in my lifetime, but first... I want to watch it suffer. || When you're at a comedy club, if you're not funny, you don't work. People will let you know, whether it's by booing or yelling for you to get out of the club. People are drunk or whatever and they'll let you have it. || Comedy, if it's done well, can reflect the mood of a nation. It can be a mirror to who we are, what we believe in, what we are like. || You know what offends me? Offended people. In a country with guaranteed rights to freedom of religion, its citizens are constantly trying to make faith in public spheres illegal, I am offended by that contradiction and want to talk about it as a comic. || I hope that nothing ever wussifies me to deny my own personal beliefs. Brainwashed wussies have been taught that standing up for yourself and defending your personal point of view makes you a close-minded hate monger. One must also be respectful of dissenting belief while supporting their own. || I always enjoyed Carlin for turning the tables on culture. He is an excellent writer that has endured for decades. || Conservative concepts believe in little government - take care of yourself, and that makes men who invent things like the constitution! Liberal thought has big government - we’ll take care of you - and that creates boys and they create things like Occupy Wall Street! There’s a difference between the way men and boys behave. || You want to reclaim your country? You got to go back to the first men who started this country, the founding fathers and this is going to be shocking for the liberal professors out there that are indoctrinating our kids but the founding fathers believed in the Judeo-Christian god that believed we have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness! You can pursuit it. If you don’t get it, it’s your fault! You messed up. Go back to work. Work harder. || When did banning anything, ever work? I mean, we banned liquor once in this country, oh, that worked like a charm, didn't it, folks? You couldn't find a drink in the roaring 20's, could ya? See that's the problem with the banning thing! I say why stop there, let's not ban guns, I know, let's ban crime! || It’s about something that strikes you as funny but I do it with a Christian world view: why we think the way we do based on God’s plan. I lift up my God and my country and I resist political correctness. || The truth is supposed to hurt. That's how it lets you know you don't got it. || Talk about sexist - have you ever, ever, heard someone come up to a woman and say ‘find your masculine side?’ And by the way women, if you find your masculine side - I’m not interested. || They got special terms that they use when they're pregnant. They don't even say ""pregnant"", got special words they use - ""I'm expecting"". Expecting what? ""I'm expecting a child, silly."" Well, then, you probably got a good shot! || If we all die and there is no God, then it’s just eternal unconsciousness, you’ll never know, but if you’re wrong... you’ll know forever. || Oh, I know: If you’re fat, let’s not blame you, let’s sue McDonalds! Oh, for cryin’ out loud, hey, if you smoke, not your fault, it’s the tobacco company’s fault! Hey, if you shoot somebody, not your fault, let’s blame the gun industry!"
Brett Butler,"Initially, he was a little apprehensive. I think now he's a lot more relaxed. He's like a duck to water, though he can play anywhere. || A female president - maybe they'd start calling it the Ova Office. || Dreams that do come true can be as unsettling as those that don't. || I'm so Southern I'm related to myself. || I was married to a subliterate, terra-cotta-toothed imbecile with violent tendencies. || I hate bigots so much it makes me one. || The most dramatic realization was that in surrender I would find more freedom and power than I'd ever known. || The beginning of my sin, if you will, was thinking that it was all a mistake and that I absolutely didn't deserve any of it. I'll tell you, bringing down my own creation that way was as grandiose a way of playing God as you could imagine. || I wanted to be a general manager. I wanted to kind of run the show, wanted to get out there and get into the nuts and bolts of finding the talent and trying to coordinate putting the club together and doing the scouting part of it and go through the whole thing. || There are no accidents. God's just trying to remain anonymous. || There's something very weird and abnormal about my particular quest to do stand-up; it's very isolating and self-important. || 'I hate to do this, but the organization is going in a different direction,' but that everything I did was fine. || I feel really grateful to have been part of what I considered a good TV show. || I have more love in me than not, I have more hope in me than not, and I have more faith than I used to. I just want to get out of the way of what I've been given, so I can do it right. || It means everything. You don't want to go through your four years of high school with a certain team beating you four years in a row. You always want to show them you can come out on top in the end. || Instead my life has been like being mashed and mashed through a wine press until finally there will be nothing left but the desire to live by divine will, knowing what I'm really supposed to do and doing it. || I spent the first twenty years of my life waiting for two men I was reasonably certain would never come back - my daddy and Jesus Christ. I don't wait for them anymore. My dad, anyway. And at least with Jesus I didn't spend all that time thinking he was gone because of something I did. || Revivals used to come to town. They would ask who wanted to be saved and I’d march right to the front. It was then I knew I was destined for a career in show business or at least alcoholism."
Brian Posehn,"I'm on top of a moving train, and it's on fire. I'm fucking some girl, and Megan Fox is there, but I'm not having sex with her. She's like, 'Why am I even here?' And I'm like, 'To prove a point. Not everybody wants to fuck you, Megan Fox.' || On a night like this, I like to punish my schlong like I caught it breaking into my house. || I also smoke a lot of pot, occasionally, every day. || My friends are trying to get me to go out on blind dates. Big 'NO' to that because all my friends are a bunch of lying geeks. They're always like, 'Brian, you're really gonna dig this girl. She's got Traci Lords' eyes, Michelle Pfeiffer's nose, Kim Basinger's lips.' Yeah, they always forget to tell me she's also got Charlie Brown's head. || Just got a new car - got a little Miata convertible. Pretty happy about it, except for one thing: I'm 6-foot-6, so now I look like a McDonald's toy. || Metal is the feeling of being an outsider, but still being part of something huge. || She wants to have cybersex, which if you don't know what cybersex is, it's like phone sex but with the keyboard. It's just a new level of sad. || I like any big city. I like any place where you can see a guy with a pants-full of pooh fighting a ghost. || I do think certain kinds of music can make you violent. Like, when I listen to Nickelback, it makes me want to kill Nickelback. || A lot of my friends, when girls break up with them, they get all bitter and vengeful and take it out on the girl. They, like, call her at four o'clock in the morning, going, 'Bitch.' Like she doesn't know who it is? Yeah, for a second, she's like, 'Grandpa?' || Grew up in a small town where there was only one crazy guy. He didn't even go insane doing anything good, like going to 'Nam or having an extended acid trip. Turns out - legend has it - he just had some bad cheese. || Always been a big heavy metal fan. I remember being 15 saying, ""Dude I'm going to love heavy metal forever. Heavy metal til I'm 60."" I'm 35 now. I think I'm going to give it one more year. || I was just surprised when my wife told me we were having a baby. I was like, ""Wow, that's awesome. You're going to make a great single mom."" || When I'm late it matters, but when everybody else is late it doesn't matter... If that's the rule then just write it down and then I know, you know... I'll read it and I'll write it down on my balls. Right here. Right here on the back of my balls is where I'll write it. On the very back. I'll just lift them and write it nicely. || People Sinatra should have sung with? Slayer. || If I see a beautiful woman walking down the street, a pretty lady, I'll yell, 'Homo!' She can't get pissed, and I still get the pleasure of yelling at her. || Honestly, it’s my experience that most people that totally suck at something think they are awesome. And a lot of people who think they suck are actually awesome. || I was such a nerd in high school, I didn't even have imaginary friends, I had imaginary bullies. || Whenever you see riot footage on TV - you know, someone throwing a brick in Pakistan or somebody throwing a fiery piece of pooh through a Starbucks window up in Seattle - you ever see anybody throwing anything underhand? I think it just takes all the aggression out of the act. || We had our family tree done... turns out I'm a quarter gay on my father's side. || If you are sitting here tonight or at home, and you're thinking, 'Hey, I'd like to get high with the dude that's been on TV all the time, outside of a comedy venue, like in a parking lot or a park of some sort.' Then that is an achievable goal. You can seriously make that shit happen. All you need is two things: to ask me and have weed. || It was seventh grade, and I wanted to get Pumas and Nikes for P.E., like all the other kids. And my mom's boyfriend takes me to K-Mart, you know, to get the cheap-ass shoes that they have there. He's like, 'Hey, they look like Adidas.' And I'm like, 'There's an extra stripe, you dick.' || I've been trying to quit smoking weed and it's really hard quitting pot. It was actually easier to become a vegetarian because your friends never show up at your house with a sack of beef. || Guys don't do that when they go out. Guys don't wear outfits that feature the dong. || Good comedy makes you laugh, and bad comedy makes people you hate laugh. || Is it weird that when your wife’s giving you oral sex, that you go ""We're going to make a mouth baby!"""
Brian Regan,"""You want another one?"" ""Oh, I don't know: I've already had two whole, entire Fig Newtons. Maybe I could try to muscle one more down but I don't think I - Mmmm, I am stuffed to the wrappers!"" They're nuts. ""We got an ER here. We got a three Fig Newton eater."" ""How many did he have? What is he nuts? Doesn't he read?"" || They didn’t invent eavesdropping for compliments. || I'm trying to do things I have never done. Like I recently went to 3 different ballets. And I loved trying to learn how to like those a little bit. || I think comedy is a good way to deal with anything. I hear about people in the hospital who are ill, and they use humor to help them through it. I think it's a great remedy for many things. || So when you do get on, the first class people are already sitting there; they're all sprawled out on their big thrones. ""Bring me the head of a pig! And a goblet of something cool and refreshing! Anyone have a fiddle? Amuse me."" || They have the x-ray area. I don't mind going through it, but I get tired of the businessmen who make way too big a deal out of their computers. 'Excuse me, I have a computer. I have a computer here. I don't know how you're going to handle this - my computer.' Oh, is he from the future? They've been around a while, pal. I think they have a way to handle your computation machine. || I would have been a lot better off if I’d studied more when I was growing up, y’know. But you know where it all went wrong was the day they started the spelling bee. Because up until that day I was an idiot, but nobody else knew. || It's the competition that I think is weird. They're not lifting weights. It's like, 'Alright, Kalkrovich, we fill these grand pianos with molten lead. See how many you can hurl in that third story window in 30 seconds.' || I go over to this other area where there's nobody around, and I got into this one thing, but I got into it wrong, apparently. I don't know where your arms and legs are supposed to go, so I just get in there and I just start moving stuff. This guy comes up: 'Hey buddy, would you mind getting out of the painters' scaffolding?' || That’s why I admired that kid who spelled it wrong on purpose so he could sit down. He knew he wasn’t going to win, so why stand there for 3 hours. First round. ""Cat, K-A-T, I'm outta here."" Then as he passed you, ""Ha! I know there's 2 T's.""  || Do people who believe in reincarnation ever say, ""Darn, I'm still writing the year 1612 on my checks!"" || You know when you say something but you want to change in the middle? Like one time I was a bout to say take care but changed in the middle to good luck so it sounded like take luck... If you have any luck take care of it. Take luck you now. Shut up! || If reading makes you smart then how come when you read a book they have to put the title of the book on the top of every single page? Does anyone get halfway through a book, ""What the hell am I reading?"" || So my eye doctor told me this. He said, “Did you know you have one eye set higher than the other eye?” “No” “It’s no big deal. It doesn’t affect your vision or anything. I just thought you’d like to be self conscious for the rest of your life.” || You see weird things driving... I've never understood log trucks, sometimes you'll be out on the highway, you see two big giant trucks loaded up with logs, and they pass each other on the highway... I don't understand it. I mean, if they need logs over there... and they need 'em over there, you'd think a phone call would save 'em a whole lot of trouble. || It means a lot to me to have my kids like what I do. And that's why I limit them. But I don't want to put that pressure on them to be a fan of mine. || Don't like when sports interviewers force answers: ""Are you dedicating this game to your sick grandmother?"" What's the guy supposed to say? || You know what's fun? You pick somebody at random, like out of the phone book, and send them about 100 'Just Because' cards. They can't even ask you why you did it. || I don't sit down with a goal of writing. I read books or magazines. I watch TV. I go to the doctor. I get on airplanes. I live a normal life and sometimes I'll notice something or read things or experience things. || I have to lay off dairy though. That's what my doctor threw in. As I was leaving his office, ""Oh, and uh, leave off dairy."" What kind of blanket sweep is that? ""And no more happiness! Away with you!"" || If you tell a kid not to run to a water slide, he/she will walk for 2 steps, then start running again. || Why are people getting on elevators shocked to find people getting off elevators? || I always get nervous with that one test. ""Tell me the exact moment point A is directly over point B."" ""Now! No, now! Now! Then! I don't know I don't know."" I'm afraid if I get it off by an eighth of a second I'll get these big, hubble coming attraction glasses. ""You must have messed up that A B test!"" ""Did I ever! Hence the corrective spectacles."" || You got to figure out how to eat your snack while your elbows are touching. You got to learn how to twist your little plastic utensil. || I called them up, ""Ya, I have ten boxes; can you come pick them up?"" ""We need to know the weight and the girth."" ""Okay, good-bye."" So I called back. ""We need the weight and the girth."" ""Okay, I don't know what the weight is, and um, I don't know what girth means... So now what's the procedure?"" So this guy talks to me like I'm four years old. ""Well do you have a bathroom scale?"" ""Uh, ya but if I put the box on the scale it's gonna cover up the numbers!"" What, do I take it off really quick? Ah, zero: I'm not fast enough. What's he talking about? So then he gives me his Mister Wizard Formula, ""How about if you stand on the scale and weigh yourself and get off the scale. Pick up the box, get back on, weigh you and the box together, and subtract your own weight."" I'm going, ""Slow down. Hold on professor."" I know this guys never tried this, because I tried it and you still can't see the numbers! Then I had to hang up in the middle of his girth formula. || I'm actually kinda quiet off stage, a lotta people don't realize that, I was at a dinner party recently, a bunch of people that I don't know, one guy talking plenty for everybody, ""Me myself right and then I and then myself and mee me I couldn't tell this one about I cause I was talking about myself and Me- Meee- Mee- Me- Me!"" Beware the me monster. || So my doctor told me to watch what I'm eating - to read food labels. I'm in the store reading the Fig Newtons label: I've always liked Fig Newtons. I'm reading the label to make sure everything's fine: fat content. I looked at the serving size; two cookies. Who eats two cookies? I eat Fig Newtons by the sleeve: two sleeves is a serving size. I open them both and eat them like a tree chipper; Fig Newton shavings coming off the side. || My parents didn't know what to do with me. They got me into Little League Baseball, I played out in right field, cause I stunk. || So I called back, ""Ya, I have ten boxes and... no I'm another guy. Ya and they all weigh exactly 22 pounds, and they all have a girth of... three."" ""Three what?"" ""Three... girth units."" || Brian, relax, man. You’ve gotta relax when you make the crank calls. || They have a section called, 'New Baby.' I don't think you need the word 'new.' They'd have to clear up confusion. 'Do you have an Old Baby section? 'Cause my friend's had a baby, and I let time get away from me, and he's 12.' || You watch a fishing show. At the end, they roll credits. There's 90 people involved with these two guys fishing! What the hell are they all doing? And one of the credits is 'film editor.' This poor guy, he's got to watch all the footage that's not exciting enough to make it into the final product. || So, what are you in for? Manslaughter! I slaughtered a man! Just like a pig! Put him on a spit and put an apple in his mouth! || It’s good to be here. I’m just trying to go through life without looking stupid. It’s not working out too well. || I never learn. Like a waitress will bring my meal. ""Hey, enjoy your meal."" ""You, too. But you don’t have one, do ya? I’m a dufus. If you do eat enjoy it when you eat it if you have a break or something, later. If you get an opportunity."" That’s all I’m trying to say. || Coach: ""Are you any good?"" Young Brian: ""I dunno, my mom sent me..."" ""Well, go to right field."" ""Oh, okay."" ""Turn around, you moron!"" ""Oh, okay"" ""Not the whole way!"" ""Oh, just some?"" || I have this friend who got divorced. I went golfing with him recently. It's the first time I'd seem him since the divorce. So when I got home, my wife's like, ""How's Gary?"" ""I don't know"" ""I thought you went golfing with Gary today"" ""I did"" ""And you don't know how he's doing?"" ""It never came up."" ""Is he dating anyone?"" ""I don't know.""

""The hundred and fifty marker's there, probably about a hundred and thirty-five. Are you dating anyone?"" || I thought yoga was easy - I went out and I bought a yoga video tape. I bought the beginners' yoga tape. I couldn't do anything on the whole hour - nothing - just fast forwarding: can't do that, can't do that - I know I can't do that. This woman in a soothing voice: 'Simply take the bottom of your right foot and place it on the small of your back.' || I eat like a kid. I like Chief Boyardee. Their Ravioli, but they have some stuff I've never seen in the real Italian food world. You ever been in a nice Italian restaurant? Hi how are you? Ummm id like to start with a nice bottle of Chanti and a couple of Caesar Salads and umm I'm going to have the Beef a'ronni. And some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the lady. || ""Would you like a nice cold fish head? They're frozen solid: frozen head of fish, the eyeballs in there and the skeleton's coming out.

You ever try that? I read good. Goodly. But I hate when you're trying to read something and you come across the expression 'One thing led to another'. What in the hell kind of lazy writing is that? Isn't that your job as the writer to tell me how this led to that? You can just throw that in there? ""Adolf Hitler was rejected as a young man on his application to art school... One thing led to another... And the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the sovereign nation of Japan."" This is some pamphlet! || How could instantly improved vision not be at the top of your TO DO list? || I was at the breakfast table this morning and I read in the newspaper that more and more adults are living at home with their parents. That surprised me, I was like ""Mom did you read this?"" || Inventions intrigue me, I was reading about the Walkie Talkie and I read it was a military inventions, that surprised me, usually military stuff has strong names you know Apache Helicopter, Tomahawk missile. ...Walkie Talkie? How did that slip through the system? Was a general talking to some guy? ""What do you have there soldier?"" Well it's a new communication device that's untethered which will enable the troops to speak effectively when they're in the field. ""What's it called?"" Walkie Talkie. Look I'm walkie and I'm talkie. Now you walkie and talkie general. I'm walkie and talkie, are you walkie and talkie? ""I like it solder, what's this explosive device?""

Honey, did we pay that parking ticket?!"" || You know, a lot of people’s last names are based on the occupations of their ancestors. That’s true. Just in my neighborhood, right across the street lived the Cooks. Right next door to us lived the Taylors. Counter-corner from us lived the Elephant Dung Shovelers. || They always say that Albert Einstein was a genius. Then how come when anyone ever calls you that, it's an insult? 'You don't know where you parked the car? Good job, Einstein.' I don't think we're honoring that man properly by using his name in vain in parking lots. || I go in for the eye test, and I don't know about you, but I concentrate like crazy during the eye exam. You don't want to get no 'D' on that thing and end up with these big thick Coke bottle glasses. || Politicians have a lot to deal with these days. It's a different world. You know who I feel bad for? Arab Americans who truly want to get into crop dusting. Could be their life long dream, and every time they ask for a pamphlet, all hell breaks loose. || You can microwave a Pop Tart. That just blew me away that you could do that. How long does it take to toast a Pop Tart? A minute and a half if you want it dark? People don't have that kind of time? Listen, if you need to zap-fry your Pop Tarts before you head out the door, you might want to loosen up your schedule. || He died of natural causes? Well he got shot in the face with a bazooka... So naturally he’d be dead. || I saw this sign posted once, it said, 'blasting zone ahead'. Wow... shouldn't that read: Road Closed.

So you'd have to run in, 'Hey, Mom, everything's fine. I just wanted to run in at full speed and say hi. And OK, so, you know Kevin? Of course. Well, you know how his right arm - usually it would bend like that? It's not bending like that right now. And it's no big deal because we already looked at it. But we were thinking, since you said that you had to go get milk later anyway, then we were all thinking if, when you go, you just might want to take him to the hospital?

What do you got grapes? How about cran-grape. What do you got mangos? Cran-mango. What do you got pork chops? Cran-chops. Why don't you back off, cran-man. Why don't you take your sales trophy and have a vacation. || We needed a refrigerator for our new place and I've never bought a refrigerator my whole life. I went into the appliance store, there's like 900 of 'em lined up, there's a salesman there. What's this guy supposed to say about refrigerators?

I'm gonna get grape, or cherry. They're both... favorites, so either one is good, but if they have both, I'll get grape, because grape is a little more favorite.

The second baseman was always tryin' to help me out. ""Hey, Brian move that way a little."" ""Okay."" I don't know what gave him the authority to tell me that. ""Oh, here? Oh, right here?

Can you put it in a cup? Yeah, don’t just splash it on my face. ‘Would you like cream and sugar with that?’ Is it black cream? If not, I’ll take it blackity black, black. Filled with blackness. Devoid of all light. Think of the blackest thing you can imagine and double that blackness and take a black magic marker and fill in the gaps and put that into a black rocket ship and shoot that into the depths of black space and close your eyes and use that as a reference. || Can you imagine being bilingual? Or even knowing anybody that was? I'm not even unilingual. Actually, I shouldn't say that. I don't give myself enough credit. I know enough English to, you know, get by. I can order in restaurants and stuff. || I have a friend who swears by food combinations - have you heard of this nonsense? She's nuts. She's like, 'You know what? You should eat food combinations, and that way you can eat whatever you want. It's just the combinations of how you put the food together.' And then her examples are like, 'You wouldn't want to eat steak and potatoes together, but you could have, like, a lemon rind and raisin skins - not the whole raisin, take the skins and steam them.' || I’m lookin’ at the Pop-Tarts box and I notice they have directions on there. I give up on this species… They have toaster directions, which, I’m not makin’ this up, the toaster directions are longer than one step. I don’t know how that’s possible that the directions are longer than one. You think it would be, “Step one: Toast the Pop-Tarts. Go ahead, toast ‘em. It’s okay. Hey, are you still readin’ this?” || So when you do board, the first class people, they're sitting there. A lot of them are working as your boarding. They have computers out and calculators. They're looking up at you like, ""Hey, we're making money right now!"" || I played softball recently. They call it softball, makes it sound like it's harmless, you know.

We're playing softball, we're all going to float around like angels!"""
Bruce Bruce,"Now, I want to explain something to you guys. I don't have an ending joke, because I don't tell jokes. I tell real-life stories and make them funny. So, I'm not like the average comedian. They have an ending joke; they always holler ""Peace! I'm out of here,"" and walk off stage. So, basically, when I get through performing on stage, I just walk off. || My comedy has no color, it’s for everybody, black, white, Latino, Asian. It’s not a pro-black show, not a def jam show; it’s just straight, wholesome type of humor. || I wouldn't take nothin' but a Ford: F-O-R-D, period. Ain't nothin' like a Ford. I wouldn't drive a Chevrolet 'cause I can't spell it. || White person write you a check, you can take it to the bank in the morning. Brother write you a check, he's gonna postdate it next Friday, look you straight in the eye and say, 'If you go in there Thursday, the money won't be there.' || You ever see people breath be so bad you can see the words coming out of their mouth? You be standing there talking - 'Yeah, I can see what you're talking about.' || I don't do too many jokes about current affairs, because almost every comedian always does that.  || Sometimes I can do a pretty clean show, since I perform at churches all the time. And sometimes I might use a ""damn"" or ""shit"" that comes out. But there's nothing that's vulgar or disrespectful. It's all good and it's all still funny, though. And I don't care what color the crowd is - black, white, Asian, whoever. It don't matter. Funny's funny and I'm gonna get them to laugh. || Being a bigger person, whether you're male or female, in entertainment, it can hurt your chances. Because people look to you to be a so-called superstar. Perfect body, perfect figure, good looking, and smart. And larger people, we have to fit in anywhere we can and the best way we can, so to speak. The way the world looks at you at being perfect, and nobody's perfect. || I’d like to help other comedians and when I get a little older I’d like to open up a nice comedy club that is straight classy, with a straight restaurant and a chef. The whole thing, red carpet, and treating people nice, for people to come back and have a good time. That’s the kind of comedy club I want to open up. || What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? I'm gonna let y'all know right now before I start, I'm stupid for real. OK? This is not an act. This is the way I act, alright, so don't think I'm pretending. || Women do fool around. But the reason they don’t get caught is that when a woman mess with a man he lives cross town, out of town. Fellas we mess with next door neighbor, co-worker, wondering why she found out. || Is it warm in here? I'm sweating like a pimp with one ho. || All my life I was a class clown, church clown, neighborhood clown. And I took a shot after my divorce. She pushed me and I took it. || That’s all they can say about me, is “fat motherfucker”, that’s it! People kill me. “Fat motherfucker.” And people that don’t like fat people, quit calling us “fat motherfucker”, ‘cause that don’t bother us, you understand what I’m sayin’? Lady called me that the other day, “ya fat muthafucka!” I don’t give a damn! You wanna make me mad, tell me Popeye’s Chicken goin’ out of business. Nigga, I set this theater on fire! || I said, 'I'm a male stripper.' He's like, 'You're kidding!' I said, 'Yeah!' He said, 'What's your stage name?' I said, 'Stretch Marks.' || You're taught as a child, when an old person says something to you, you don't talk back. But now I am an adult, I let their ass have it, you hear me? I'm in church Sunday; I spot this old lady. I said, 'Hey ma'am, how you doing?' She said, 'Hey baby, how big you goin' get?' I said, 'How old you goin' get?' She got mad, 'You fat ass,' 'You old bitch - we're in church now!'"
Buddy Hackett,"My wife said to me, ""I want to be cremated."" I said, ""How about Tuesday?"" || Golf is more fun than walking naked in a strange place, but not much. || Your financial cost can best be figured out when you realize that if you were to devote the same time and energy to business instead of gold, you would be a millionaire in approximately six weeks. || The second day of a diet is always easier than the first. By the second day you're off it. || I've had a few arguments with people, but I never carry a grudge. You know why? While you're carrying a grudge, they're out dancing. || Ya know, if you treat every comic the way you treated me tonight, you would never see a bad show. || I've had a good day when I don't fall out of the cart. || As a child my family's menu consisted of two choices: take it or leave it."
Carlos Mencia,"Going there is paying your dues. You always have to pay your dues... You've just got to do it. Maybe I come from a working family. Maybe it's the voice of my mom saying, 'You've always got to be nice to people.' I look at it as saying it's going to be fun. Those people are going to be really, really happy. || I don't have the time to steal other people's material even if I wanted to. The reason why these rumors got started is that I don't really contest them because I don't believe they deserve contesting. I really don't. || We dropped two bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and the name of the plane that delivered the weapons was the Enola Gay. Do you know why? Because we wanted them to know that they were about to get boned in the ass. || If you had a personal trainer, you would probably eat him. I know that in every fat person, there's a skinny person inside, but you could have all the season's contestants of America's Next Top Model in you. I hope I get reincarnated as your feet.

When a shark comes out of the water, walks into a 7-11, and bites you in the ass, then it's news! || Racism is exclusion, that's why I make fun of everybody. || I think we all feel the same things most of the time, we just don't know how to put it into words. When I'm on stage, I say it. The truth makes people laugh. || I've gotten in trouble with every race you can imagine. || The interviewer goes, 'Alright, let me clarify. Are you a Democrat or a Republican?' 'I'm neither.' 'Well, why not?' 'Because I'm kind of smart and I don't enjoy being half wrong all the fucking time.' || When a black person has no electricity, no water, they call it the ghetto. When white people have no electricity and no water, they call it camping. || When I say Home Depot, everyone in this room thinks one thing: beaner. We all think beaner - guy hanging out in front of Home Depot - and I don't have a problem with that. You know what I have a problem with? When I turn on NASCAR, and the dude driving the Home Depot car is white. That pisses me off. White people, that's our car, bitch. You put a beaner in the Home Depot car. We need to be driving that car. White people don't need to be driving a Home Depot car. White people should be driving the car sponsored by Saltines. || In all honesty, we don't know what's in the hearts of other men. All I know is that I respect comedy and I know comedy. I would never, ever, ever take somebody else's joke. || If you're Filipino, you're the beaner of the Asian community 'cause you're just like us. You're indigenous people that got banged by some Spaniards. That's why you have names like Kwan Ping Del Toro. || Great soul of Gandhi, cover your ears. You will not want to hear this! Listen, you inbred piece of Ku Klux Krap! You white people love to be racist, but the only races you can tell apart are Indianapolis and Daytona. I hope I am reincarnated as toothpaste, so I never have to see you again. Now take your twelve-pack of wife-beating juice and get the park out of my store! || You know what they said in California? I saw it on C-Span - people we vote for - this is what they said, 'I propose that we kick all of the illegal aliens out of this country. Then we build a super-fence so they can't get back in.' And I went, 'Um, who's gonna build it?' || I was doing this 'dee dee dee' joke. You know what 'dee dee dee' means, right? It means stupid. This lady gets all pissed at me: 'Excuse me, sir, what if there was someone severely retarded in the crowd right now?' I'm like, 'Well, he's severely retarded, lady. Obviously he wouldn't know I'm fuckin' with him.' || A tank is made to drive and shoot with a turn that spins at 360 degrees. Do you know what that is? That's a drive-by! || I'm sitting down, and then these two ladies are pissed at me because I'm not crying. And then they go, ""Excuse me, sir, why aren't you crying, sir?"" I'm like, ""'Cause I read the book, bitch. Keep bothering me, and I'll ruin the ending"". || What you have to do is be honest with who you are. Find that thing inside of you that is you and be that. Don't lie and don't perpetrate. I am sick and tired of ugly bitches that wear shirts that say, 'Cutey.' || He immigrated to America, moved us all to east L. A. where all the Mexicans treated us like crap; because they would say, and I quote, 'Eh, you're from farther.' || During the riots, blacks and Mexicans showed how smart we are. They told us where to go steal shit. We ran to K-Mart, loaded up with shit. Walked out the door. And then we did interviews with evidence in our hands. I'm watching the news going, ""Fuck Armando! Put the radio down!"" || Blacks and Mexicans do the dumbest shit. The dumbest genocide. Killing each other other fuckin' gang territory that doesn't even belong to us. But when its comes to those crazy ""I'll kill 30 kids, bury them under my house and dress up like a clown"", white people you take the cake on that shit... Of all the people who got fired from the post office and came to shoot the post office up, how many of them were Black or Mexican? None. And we get fired all the fucking time. || If you ask me right now, you've seen the last of Mind of Mencia. I don't want to be a one-trick pony. I would rather walk away and do more movies, comedy and even some dramatic roles. || When I go onstage, I don't know what I'm going to say. I don't know what's going to come out of my mouth. It's one of those questions where any and everything is possible. I literally could be talking about somebody I was hanging out with two seconds ago or something from the news. Literally, there's really no rhyme or reason for it. I want to be free flowing like that. || What I say is stupid. Who takes a comedian seriously? I'm doing sophisticated knock-knock jokes. || If I were to say that I grew up in East Los Angeles in the projects poor, I assumed that everybody understood that it came with its own reasons for being the way I am. I didn’t get that people needed to understand where my comedy came from; I thought that they knew that. Now I tell people. || Hurricane Katrina was caused by political correctness. I said it! || If you ain't laughing, you ain't living, baby. || Here's how it works: Mexican people are called beaners, okay? I said it! That's right, I said it! I am a funny motherfucker! || I'm the only person on Earth who's not afraid to admit that black people are better dancers than white people! I said it, I said it! You were all thinking it, I said it! || Dee Dee Dee dosen't mean mentally retarded. It means stupid. This song goes out to all the stupid people out there. Your gonna find this song hilarious, and you don't even know it's about you. || Whether you're black or white, Uzbeki or Jew... you're probably an asshole too. || In Texas, if your name is Carlos, you're a Mexican. In Florida, you're a Cuban. In New York, you're a Puerto Rican. And I come to Canada and I find out I'm an Eskimo. || Now I admit I like Gold Digger, but Kanye West is a crazy nigga. || If your gonna drop out of school - tough grades are not your goal - then change your name to Candy and learn to work a pole. || A family is suing Seaworld because they found their 27 year old son, dead and naked, in Shamu's pen. Look if you're 27 and you're still living at home with your mom and dad you need to kill yourself. The lawsuit also contends that the gifts at the gift shop don't show the nature of these vicious animals. Yeah, what part of the words ""killer whale"" do you not understand. If I told you there were some killer Mexicans living next door you wouldn't want to hang out with them. ""But Judge Carlos, I thought Shamu loves everybody."" He does...FOR DINNER. Can I get an amen? What do you say, ghost of Johnny Cochran? || What do you feed them? Losing lottery tickets? You're never going to win the lottery! You have a better chance of getting knocked up by Ryan Seacrest. And you have enough kids! Take your fifty dollars and buy yourself a vagina cork. I hope I get reincarnated as a condom so I never have to see your ugly-ass face again! || I am a product... I'm a comedian. I'm not curing cancer. In the end, I tell jokes. I make people laugh. I make sense out of ridiculous situations, but in the end, it's all about laughter. It's all about your cheek hurting, your stomach hurting. || I'll admit it, the Holocaust was definitely a bad thing, but do we really need Jewish people around? They have big noses. I said it!

Now get the fark out of my store! I hope I am reincarnated as a turtleneck... Thank you for getting that joke! || Every single man in this room has crapped his pants. There is not a man in here that has not done that. Sometimes we don't even know when it happens. Sometimes we take off our underwear and go, 'Oh my God, where did that come from?' That's where the term 'holy shit' comes from. || When women can't climax, it's our fault, but when we can't get an erection, we have to go to the doctor. || Instead of uniting America, we want to separate each other because, you know, Mexicans eat tacos and white people eat beef stroganoff and black people eat chicken. 'That makes us different.' No, that makes you hungry. || That's Chunky Monkey ice cream! || When it comes to my daughter, I'm a conservative. But when it comes to your daughter, I'm a liberal! || I got in trouble because I came here, and I said, 'Hey, San Francisco! There's a lot of races here. I want to go find the beaners.' So I look on the map... I kept looking on the map for something beaner, and then I went 'Oh there's where the beaners hang out obviously: Castro.'

That ain't right, man. || I'll know America is in bad shape when Cubans in Miami get in the water and swim back to Cuba. || I was in Mexico, and I see how these people operate. They're not stupid.

And then I looked outside, and there were Mexicans standing out front - but there was nothing inside, but they were outside. And then I realized: it's a training facility! || When white people eat potato chips, they're called white people. When black people eat potato chips, they're called niggas. || A lot of people out there are going to ask 'why did they interview Carlos about this? Carlos is a joke thief, Carlos steals jokes and we know this.' Listen to me and look at me when I tell you this, with all honesty: if you think that I steal jokes, fuck yeah, you're right! Of course I fucking steal jokes, are you out of your fucking mind? When I come to a comedy club, you better run, bitch, you better get the fuck off stage because if anything you say is even remotely funny, I'm going to make it mine. And all I'm going to do is say 'Mexican' in the front. I'm like a rapper, I just sample shit and make it my own. Was that really my song? I don't know, but it sounds like mine, but it kind of sounds like somebody else's. It's a hit, bitch! || I'm not white - I don't apologize for what made my country great. || God has a sense of humor. If you don't believe me, tomorrow go to wal-mart and just look at people. || I have little compassion for people in trailer parks who refuse to move after getting tornado warnings. How hard is it for them to relocate? Their house have wheels.  || What do eggs have to do with Jesus Christ? I understand Christmas. Three wise men show up with gifts, 'I love you.' Symbolism, I get that. How did the egg thing happen? Did somebody walk up to somebody else, 'Hey, did you hear? Jesus rose from the dead.' 'Hide the eggs! Hide the eggs! We gotta trick Jesus. Paint the eggs pink or purple. Put them in the park! Trick Jesus!' || My mom looks at my dad and goes, 'Do I look fat in this dress?' And my dad goes, 'Don't be stupid, you look fat in everything.' || My mother is still mad at me from when the pope died. She calls me up when the pope died, 'Meho, we have to go to church and pray for him.' I go, 'Mom, it's the pope. We don't have to pray for him. Just stay home.' 'No, meho, he needs our help.' I'm like, 'Mom, you're Catholic. You believe that the pope is the holiest person on Earth. You believe that he actually talks to God.' 'Well he does.' 'Well, if that's true, pendejo, he's in heaven. He doesn't need your help. If the pope needs help getting into heaven, you and I are fucked. Do you understand that?' || I'm glad Hurricane Katrina happened. It taught us an important lesson: black people can't swim. || I love mullets. The other day, in Pittsburgh, I saw the greatest mullet I've ever seen. I can't describe it. It was just the mullet of all time; complete 'business in the front, party in the back.' I've never seen anything like it. || It is never okay to use the toilet with the door open... I never want to know what comes out of there because sometimes I eat at that restaurant. || What is that fucking dot on Indian guy's heads? I know what it is. It's a camera. That's why they work at 7-11. Don't steal shit. They got your ass on camera. || Why are we rebuilding New Orleans? Whose idea was this, Aquaman? || You're Hispanic. You speak Spanish. You're doing ethnic jokes. Taco Bell is one of your first targets. || Dos tequilas for the table por favor, both of them for the lady. || Like my father I, too, was born in Central America - Nebraska. || Mexico sent 39 trucks filled with Mexican soldiers to help out the cause. Now, first of all, they said it was 39 trucks and 180 soldiers. I'm a beaner, and I'm telling you white people, that's a bullshit number right off the bat! There's at least a thousand beaners there right now! || Race makes things funny. A black guy driving in NASCAR: not funny. A black guy driving a car sponsored by Tide: not funny. A black guy driving a car sponsored by Aunt Jemima: hilarious. || America is such a great country, we have fat poor people. || Do you think we care about the feelings of Native Americans when we celebrate Columbus Day? That's the day that the white man discovered a land where Indians had been living for a few thousand years. || I'm not an evil person, I'm not an evil person. I feel very bad for the people in New Orleans like the sick people, the poor people, the elderly, those people couldn't get out. But let's talk about the dumbasses who are still there but the ones who are going 'I'm not gonna leave! I'm not gonna leave! Because I'm going to stay here and protect my TV!' Listen, you fucking idiot: unless you have a plasma that got wet by this much water I suggest you get the fuck out of your house right now, you understand me? || And for all of you at home, you are all welcome to visit my store. You are also welcome to park off you motherparking parks, and go park yourself. But remember, don't park in a handicapped spot. || Friends? I see... I have the perfect song for you. ""No one with a penis is really your friend, they say they are but it's all pretend, he listens to your problems every time he phones you, but he's really not, he just wants to bone you!"" || You know those pills like Viagra, well they say that if you have an erection for more than 36 hours consult your physician. Well, if you don't know what to do with your boner after 36 hours then you are a DE and your wife doesn't know what to do then she's a DA. You two shouldn't reproduce because then your kid's gonna be like DEDADE. || Here, let's go to my dressing room, and I promise, I'll only put it in for a second. || We celebrate Labor Day by not going to work? || I grew up in the projects and I know how important it is for kids to have hope. || Dee dee dee! || Don't tell God! || What do you come out on the news saying? 'We want to be treated like equals in the workplace.' No you don't. You want to be treated like a woman in the workplace, and you want to get paid like an equal. That's what you want. Because when men treat you like equals, what do you do? You send us to sensitivity training, bitch. That's what you do. || When white people wear baggy clothing and speak gibberish they're homeless. When black people wear baggy clothing and speak gibberish they're called rappers."
Carol Leifer,"Stand-up comedy - I love this job, and I gotta tell you, folks - knock wood - it's been working. 'Cause I was one of those kind of people, even when I had a regular job, I couldn't even call in sick right. You know, I was like, 'Hello? Yeah, I can't come in today. I have scurvy.' || I think you know you're close to somebody if you can walk out of the bathroom and go, 'You don't want to go in there for a while.' || Time flies, though, huh? But I feel young. And do you know how I stay feeling young, ladies and gentlemen? I'll share my secret with you: I live in a senior citizen retirement community. || I was watching Maury Povich the other day. He had these people on who say that they've had near death experiences. Do you ever notice they always say the same thing? 'I remember seeing this really bright, white light.' It's like, of course, you pinhead, it's the paramedic looking in your pupils with a penlight. || I was working recently in London - what a thrill, yeah. But I wasn't used to their money, though, 'cause I bought this really decadent box of chocolates - the cashier said, 'That'll be 10 pounds.' I'm like, 'Rub it in, why don't you?' || Women, stop buying the lingerie. Stop buying it right now. Oh, it's a big rip off. Oh my god, $18 bucks for panties this big? Come on, one trip through the dryer, and it's a frilly bookmark. || Been thinking about having a baby. But if I want to do it, I'd have to do it soon 'cause it's getting near closing time. The clock is ticking. My gynecologist said, if I wanted to have a baby, I would have to do it - the latest - by the ended of this show. || You know what bugs me? When a woman is expecting and her bonehead husband runs around going, ""We're pregnant!"" We're pregnant. Yeah, and my balls itch pal. || Oh man, I get a lot of junk email. Isn't it annoying? Clutters everything up. I'm starting to sense a theme, though. Apparently, there's a lot of people out there that want to make my penis three inches longer. || Long Island - if you're from out of town, how would I describe it? Well, every girl in my neighborhood looked like Kenny G. || Whenever I travel I like to keep the seat next to me empty. I found a great way to do it. When someone walks down the aisle and says to you, ""Is someone sitting there?"" just say, ""No one-except the Lord."" || You know what kills me about Jennifer Lopez? The fact that this woman wakes up one day and she's like, 'You know what? From now on, I'd like people to call me J-Lo,' and then they do it. Only a celebrity can get away with this. George Bush doesn't come out for his morning press conferences: 'From now on, I'd like to be referred to as G-Bu. Y'all know my vice president, Dog Chain.' || When do we put on the lingerie? Always at the beginning of the relationship - first couple of months, strutting around the bedroom wearing a teddy. Yeah, six months later, you've stopped shaving your legs and you look like a teddy. || Golf is a lot like stand-up comedy. You have to suck to get good in the long run and I have always loved a challenge like that. The shoes are funny and always keep me laughing, especially when I suck extra hard! || Women in the workplace - we still have big strides to make. Girlfriend of mine just got a new job. First question the new boss asked her was if she could make a good cup of coffee... Yeah, she stormed right out of that Starbucks. || Animal experiments are no joke. Thank goodness scientists are finding better, more humane ways to develop treatments for cancer and other killer diseases. || He tricked me into marrying him. He told me he was pregnant. || I recently became vegan because I felt that as a Jewish lesbian, I wasn't part of a small enough minority. So now I'm a Jewish lesbian vegan. || I'm always a big fan of if you approach somebody politely about something and you're not a nudge - you're just pretty honest and simple, my kind of philosophy is that I'm not afraid of 'no,' and that's way different than 'I won't take no for an answer.' || I suddenly had this really mad desire to have an affair with a woman. I was divorced. I was childless. I figured there's got to be one more way to really tick off my mom. || You can never go wrong betting on Americans' bad eating habits. So I've made a ton investing in all fast food chains, while at the same time investing in Dockers, spandex, Spanx, and sweatpants. Basically, anything with an elastic waistband is a goldmine. || I was over there in Hawaii. I was there on the big island. The 'Big Island' - that name cracks me up. First of all, it's not that big, so I'm pretty sure a guy came up with that name. || The only thing I said to my parents when I was a teenager was ""Hang up, I got it!"" || Sex when you’re married is like going to a 7-Eleven. There’s not as much variety, but at three in the morning, it’s always there. || The average, healthy, well-adjusted adult gets up at seven-thirty in the morning feeling just plain terrible. || My stand-up act is very clean. || My father was the king of the joke-tellers. I was so impressed as a child watching him, holding people in rapt attention. || My father was the kind of guy who'd always say 'Throw out any subject and I got a joke on it.' || I never thought I was going to have children. I just thought after 45, that was it. || I'm wearing a new perfume that I should recommend to the women in the audience; it's called 'Tester.' || When you lie about your age, the terrorists win. || I feel I've always got to keep my stand-up because I never want to lose it. || I cried when I turned 34 for no other reason than 34 sounded old to me at the time. || As a writer, the worst thing you can do is work in an environment of fear of rejection. || Making love to a woman is like buying real estate: location, location, location. || All my other relationships with men, there was so much maneuvering and strategic decisions and stuff. || Oh, this is fun - went to a nude beach for the first time. Yeah, that's what I thought. You ever been to a nude beach? Thought it would be all sexy and hot. Oh my God, what a flubber fest! Everybody who shouldn't be naked is naked - didn't make me want to take off my clothes, made me want to take out my contacts. || Just be your authentic self because there's nothing sexier or more beautiful than that. || Honestly, so much of my book is about the best things in my life have happened since I'm 40. || My father was a huge influence on me. || My kind of gay is like the late-breaking-lesbian kind of gay. || There are so many opportunities that I could've gotten before if I had just took a little more of a risk. || There were very few women comics when I started out doing stand-up. But I always saw that as a great advantage. || My kind of gay, meeting a woman and falling in love, is a different experience because it wasn't anything about 'Oh, I've always been gay and I'm breaking the chains.' || I had been vegan for about six months when I went to a taping of Ellen's show. She had heard that I was vegan and was inquiring about it. Lesbians are really known for being animal lovers. Gay women always have so many pets. Besides loving my dogs, I really see animals all on the same plane. And after reading a book like Skinny Bitch or seeing videos from inside a dairy farm or a slaughterhouse, it's really hard to turn back. Because we love animals so much, it's the next logical step. || New York: the only city where people make radio requests like ""This is for Tina - I'm sorry I stabbed you."" || I always say to women, 'Take advantage of the fact that you're in the minority, don't see it as a disadvantage. You're that much more unique when there's fewer of you.' || When you're single again, at the beginning you're very optimistic and you say, ""I want to meet someone who's really smart, really sweet, really sensitive"". And six months later you're like, ""Lord, any mammal with a day job"". || I’m sorry I didn’t have this revelation earlier. I sleep better and more soundly because I’m not participating anymore. || Obviously, at this age, I've lost people in my life. But with a parent, it's just different. I was very attached to my father and had this naive little-girl notion that he'd always be around. So I'm finding acceptance of my father's death is the hardest thing to accept. || What is a date, really, but a job interview that lasts all night? The only difference between a date and a job interview is that in not many job interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it. || It was a mixed marriage. I'm human, he was a Klingon. || They're all sources of material. What I love about what I do, the more you talk about your life, there are so many people who have similar experiences. || Like a lot of women, I'm bisexual. Once I have sex with you - bye! || I think what I would say to my younger self, and probably to younger, just starting-out writers is that a lot of times you're just afraid to put yourself out there, and it's uncomfortable because it's working up the courage to do something, to push yourself to do those things. || Oh my God, Kennedy Airport - what a mess - all over you with those dopey security questions. 'Did you receive any gifts from any unknown persons?' Buddy, the last thing I got from an unknown person was in the 80's. || Growing up, it was always, ‘If you buy kosher meat, they’re killed humanely.’ But I’ve seen so many horrible videos. What we thought was humane 100 years ago is not humane anymore. The ways animals suffer, I just couldn’t be a part of it anymore. || She reminds me of Roseanne before she was discovered. Darlene has that same clear point of view and a very dry, take-charge kind of attitude. || I'm not afraid of putting myself out there to someone and then them passing on it. At least you could have gotten a 'yes.' So it's worthwhile to have the cojones to do it. || I've seen too many comics who got their own shows and were undone because they worked for an executive producer who didn't understand their comedy or their sensibility. || My father was a really funny guy. He lived a good long life. And he was the reason I wanted to be funny and become a comedian and a comedy writer, so to say that he's somewhat of a mythic figure in my life would be an understatement."
Carrot Top,"My way of fitting in was through jokes and making people laugh. || Some people even think I wear a wig. Do they think I went into a salon one day and said, ""Can you please screw this up really bad?"" || I think, over the years, I've kind of evolved. || My real name is Scott Thompson. I could have gone by that name, but when I started doing comedy I thought I needed to go by something that has a little more of a hook. || Carrot Top is a nickname that people call me and I thought that it was more marketable. || So I try not to look too far into the future because I think that everything happens and will happen for a reason. || I was the class clown at school, but at home, my family wasn't very funny. || I never looked at Gallagher like he was a threat to me. || Comics don't like to see other comics do well. || I think the more you do this and the more comfortable you become on stage, you start speaking more and becoming more of a character in yourself. || I always make fun of KISS because I don't particularly think their music is anything. || I always thought marketing in general was an interesting kind of thing. I always liked commercials and billboards. || Everyone has the gift of laughter inside of them. All the world is a prop. || When I told my friends I was going to be a comedian, they laughed at me. || There's nothing wrong with trying to reach out to new fans. || People do give me a hard time about my hair because it's orange and it's big. || I didn't really have a plan of attack when I got in college. || My way of making people like me was to make 'em laugh. || Like I told Howard, I can't help it that I'm beautiful. || I think it's the fact that I do something different and that I actually have some success with it. That bothers a lot of people... especially comics. || It's weird, I never wish anything bad upon anybody, except two or three old girlfriends. || Video games are so popular these days, getting the opportunity to star in one is something special. More people should do it. || People always want to put a label on you; they always want to compare you to something. || The street in the center of town was Butts road. I stole the sign and told the audience, this must be where the assholes live. I also had a Neighborhood Crime Watch - it takes about 20 seconds to break into a house but it took me an hour to unbolt this sign. || On the weekends, I would go down and play these clubs in Key West or West Palm Beach or surrounding areas of Florida and then I'd go back to school for the week. || It's our nature: Human beings like success but they hate successful people. || The blessing is that everyone knows who I am because of the commercials."
Cedric the Entertainer,"It is a big world that we live in, and people have a choice to love who they love. || They’ve come to kill us! And take our women! And our precious metals! || Never in life do you hear about a large group of black people getting killed altogether. 'Cuz we run. Nigga, we run when we see somebody else runnin'. We don't ask no questions why we runnin', we don't need no run coordinator to get the runnin' all organized. Nigga, if I'm with you, and you start runnin'...dammit, I'ma start runnin'! || Well, you know, my name is Ced and I kinda consider myself an entertainer. Hey that ain’t bad yeah, Cedric the Entertainer. || I can’t go to jail, not with his soft skin and these boyish good looks. I’ll be snapped up before the first lights out! || I've been blessed to have a long career. || We as comics do want an immediate response from the audience. It's really quiet on the set, and there are only the producers, and the director, so a comic is looking for someone to give a reaction, even if it is the camera guy. || I want to be a little more dramatic nowadays. I definitely want something big and funny, but I look for things that can just have people see me in a different light and let me mature as both an entertainer and an actor and a comedian. || I love stand up and it keeps me grounded, to say the stuff I have been thinking without anyone changing it. || Politics move, as fast as Twitter, and for everyone to think that in four years America was going to be perfect is ridiculous. || If I want my chips? Yeah, I want my chips. Who is this?"
Chelsea Handler,"I'd like to go out for a cocktail... or seven. || Katie Holmes told In Style magazine that Tom’s turned on by the sight of her in a suit and miniskirt. Tom also likes it when Katie wears the monitoring bracelet on her ankle. || My mom was kinda like a cat. She slept a lot. || I tried to put myself up for adoption several times. || I don't cook... I don't know how to clean... there's may be a good chance I'm an alcoholic. || Most men would never tell a girl her Pikachu smells like a crab cake. It's just not done. But they would have no qualms about telling their guy friends. Similarly, if you're a guy and you pull your pants down, and the girl you're with immediately stats text messaging her friends, you have a small penis. || No one has ever said to me ‘go home and make a baby.’ I have been told several times to go to Planned Parenthood and make the baby go away. Happy Hannukah. || Having a baby, it's like a five year commitment. || People always tell me I need to have a kid, and I say, ""No, I don't."" Because I wouldn't have just one kid; I'd have six. I need a huge family. So I just kind of fill my house with tons of rejects and misfits so it feels like I have a bunch of children. || I think the people I talk about are generally so stupid that they don’t even know I’m saying bad things about them. I've run into Paris Hilton and she’s like, ""Oh, I love your show."" And I’m like, ""You can’t love my show if you can hear."" || I don’t know what’s going on with Britney. I think by now she’s her own species. We need to catch her, tag her and send her back out into her natural habitat - Starbucks - so we can observe her and learn more about her. || You don't run into ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends when you're looking good and want to. Last time I ran into an ex-boyfriend was at three o'clock in the morning at Rite Aid, as I'm ringing up Gas X and corn removers. And I'm like, 'Hey, you. What's up? These are for my grandmother, that old bitch.' He's like, 'Aren't they both dead?' I'm like, 'One of them came back, OK? And she's sick.' || When you hit rock bottom, you've got to go to AA. They make it sound so dirty. Please, I've hit rock bottom dozens of times. I've woken up next to a billy goat. You don't just give up. || He's really committed... to being an alcoholic, and I respect that. || For months there have been rumors that J.Lo is finally pregnant with Marc Anthony’s baby. She was afraid it might never happen. I’m afraid it’s going to look like Marc Anthony... || Pam Anderson and Rick Salomon just got themselves a marriage license. I think before she gets married again Pam needs to slow down and think about whether this is really the man she wants to spend three or four months of her life with. || An L. A. County Superior Court judge issued an order today taking custody of Britney’s two children away from her. K-Fed was surprised when Larry Birkhead swooped in at the last moment and grabbed them for himself. || Next to fat babies, midgets are my favorite things to hold. I love them so much, and I want to help them to do adult things like drive cars, Jet-Ski, and lip-synch. I’m in awe of their little limbs, their large craniums, and their medicine-ball asses. I love the little baby steps they take while shifting their weight from side to side, and the fact that when you knock one over accidentally, he flails like a turtle on its back that can’t get up right away. || I wish it was that easy to get turned on for me - at this point, I need a bottle of Belevere and a fighterjet. || Why would you go out and not drink? Just stay home and sit there. || First of all, I'm not an actor - I'm an asshole. || You should never be mean to other girls. I don't care what grade you're in. Be nice to people until you're my age... and you have your own TV show. || I think they should make Twilight closets and all the cast members can walk out of them. || Boy George has been charged with falsely imprisoning a man who'd gone to his apartment to pose for photographs. Going to Boy George's house to get your picture taken is like going to David Copperfield's island for a ""radio opportunity"". || Kristen Stewart always looks like she's posing for pictures taken in a basement by her creepy uncle. || That's Al Qaeda's new plan: to destroy America one period at a time. || Most republicans are against contraception because they don't care about it. You can't get pregnant anally anyway. || Nicole Richie’s baby shower is going to be this Sunday at 12:30 in the afternoon. It should be a very special event - many of these people are going to be seeing each other for the first time in broad daylight. || Paris Hilton is one of the hosts for Nicole Richie’s baby shower, and they’re serving sushi. Awesome, Paris - sushi, the one thing pregnant women are forbidden to eat. Thanks for the mercury. || Paula Abdul’s really impatient to start a family. She says if she has to wait much longer she’s going to go crazy-er. || A federal grand jury is investigating allegations that David Copperfield raped, assaulted and threatened a woman he took to his private island in the Bahamas in July. What happened to the good old days when a guy would just saw you in half? || I know they don’t recommend Ibuprofen during pregnancy, but you needed something fast for the hangovers. || They come over and they go, 'Why don't you come over on Friday night? We're gonna have a bunch of people over. We're gonna have game night. It's gonna be nutty.' Unless we're playing 'Who's Hiding the Ecstasy?' I'm not gonna make it, OK? 'Cause that's my favorite game. || That's Al Qaeda's new plan: to destroy America one period at a time. || We spend so much money on these dresses that are terrible. And what do we get out of it? Nothing - a piece of chicken and a roll in the hay with her hillbilly cousin - no thank you. My family's very close; I can do that at home. || The L. A. Times is reporting that Britney Spears' album Blackout will be number one on the Billboard charts. Not to toot my horn, but I predicted this on my show a week ago. No one wanted to believe me - even I didn't want to believe me, but now I know how Nostradamus feels. || Paris Hilton has launched a new champagne in a can called Rich Prosecco. For the ad campaign Paris posed wearing nothing but gold paint. That’s a unique way to cover up herpes. || This kind of mixing of ingredients happens all the time at fast-food places... You know when you order french fries and there's a rogue onion ring at the bottom. You know, at first you're alarmed but you eat it. It all comes from the same place! You just have to go for it. || It’s true what they say about patience being a virtue; it just happens to be a virtue that I choose not to pursue. || I was in a tailspin of confusion I hadn't experienced since the first time I heard George W. Bush speak. || One of my girlfriends was getting married. This was becoming an annoying pattern. || Vomit and feces are two reason I have decided not to procreate. || I look hot and, most of all, skinny. I love the day after throwing up. I felt like a feather. || A lot of people think that keying a car isn't the right way to get back at a guy. I disagree. || I hate when men think that money is gonna buy you happiness... I mean, it helps. || I find it very annoying when people want to sit next to each other at a booth. || The only reason I think I would marry a foreigner would be to have kids with weird accents. || I don't think anyone should have 20 kids. You need to spread your seed somewhere else. Go shit in your sock once in a while. || If diamonds are a girl's best friend, I wonder if blood diamonds are a girl's best friend 5 days out of the month? || I would rather sit next to a transgender person and discuss why every single one I've met smells like a bar in the daytime than listen to people tell my why I want to have children and that I just don't know it yet. I do know, because I'm me and my feelings are the ones in my head. I don't want to have kids, and it's not a device to get attention or have conversations about it. I simply find children incredibly immature and, more often than not, dumb. || I don't know what it is about accents that makes me want to get undressed and high-five myself. || You know you're a hot mess when the only person buying you drinks all night is yourself. || I watched the American Music Awards last night. Beyonce lost in all three of her categories, but she did win a special award - which was our way of saying we still love you but we need to see other people. || In a statement to the Associated Press earlier in the year, Jamie Lynn said she didn't have a boyfriend. She said, ""I'm keeping my options open."" And by options, she meant legs. || It looks like Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are ‘taking a break.’ Their engagement is off, and Heidi is going back to Colorado. This is really sad for Heidi and for all the Hills fans and for the entire state of Colorado. || If you wait too long in Vegas, you end up with a chicken finger in your underwear. || I went one time. It wasn't voluntary; it was pretty much court ordered. But I thought I could give back to the AA community, you know, see all those single hottie men there. I could be like a sponsor. Have them call me at two in the morning, and be like, 'I want to have a drink.' I'll be like, 'I have one! Come over!' || Another thing I take issue with are people who take their dogs on ""play dates,"" or even worse, people who choose to dress their dogs up in outfits better suited for homosexuals participating in a gay pride parade. Dog costumes are right up there with something else I find particularly offensive: sweater vests. || You don't give something away because it's fat. You take it and you look at it. || It's good that people don't like you. That's good. It means that you are doing something interesting. || I'm not graceful either. I have no rhythm, I'm never on top. || The only people I owe an apology to are my dead parents. Except my father because he's still alive. || Can you imagine getting a gun for a secret Santa? That is especially not a good idea if you work in a post office. || Who's the president on the $100 bill? I don't know. I don't need to know because I don't use cash. I only use travelers checks. || Why don't you get me a gift? I'm still single! I don't know if you can register at a liquor store, but I would like to try. || When I don't know what to do, I just open my mouth. Why won't anyone date me? || Mexico's a great place to overcome a drug addiction. || If you treat your kid like a dick and you're a dick... you're gonna have a family of dicks. || It’s so weird that I would say something wrong. || If you can't trust your coke dealer, who can you trust? || There's a McDonalds in Hong Kong & they're offering couples the opportunity to get married. You can have a McWedding. || Everybody I hire is more fucked up than I am. || I'll tell you what can make bacon better... nothing. || He's as gay as a candle in the wind. || In these tough economic times, everybody has to cut back. I am down to three tabs of ecstasy a day. || Then they have the audacity to go shopping and pick out their own gifts. I want to know who the first person was who said this was okay. After spending all that money on a bachelorette weekend, a shower, and often a flight across the country, they expect you to go to Williams Sonoma or Pottery Barn and do research? Then they send you a thank-you note applauding you for such a thoughtful gift. They're the one who picked it out! || I've found that many of the people who have a passion for karaoke too often have misplaced confidence, which can become aggressive and border on sadistic. I know my limits, and karaoke is where I draw the line. I wouldn't put anyone through the hell of listening to me sing a song, and I sure as shit wouldn't wait in line to do it. || What about your constitutional right to bear arms, you say. I would simply point out that you don’t have to exercise a constitutional right just because you have it. You have the constitutional right to run for president of the United States, but most people have too much sense to insist on exercising it. || Drew Carey was the guest on Ellen's breakdown show. You know, the next night, when he was hosting The Price Is Right, he ended his show with ""Don't forget to spay and neuter your pets, and for God's sake don't ever take one away from Ellen!"" || Amy Winehouse’s mother wrote an open letter to the News of the World newspaper telling Amy she’s worried about her and to please call her. I doubt this is the best way to communicate with Amy - she should try spelling it out in lines of cocaine. || I'm very much about letting other people shine, because it makes us all shine brighter. || I didn't become a comedian to work this hard. || I'm into politics, and I love watching the heavier news magazine shows. || It's a dream come true to have someone else portray me. Because I've been living this life for a long time, and I'm over myself. || People ask me why I'm so hard on men. It's because they've gotten a really easy ride. And it's not that I think women should take over the world. But I do think it should be 50/50. || My relationship with my father had been on the proverbial fritz since the time I was fifteen and called the police to report him for child molesting. He had never molested me, but I wanted to have a party that weekend and needed him out of the house. || I'll always be doing stand-up as long as people are still interested in seeing me. || I went out with a guy who once told me I didn't need to drink to make myself more fun to be around. I told him, I'm drinking so that you're more fun to be around. || It looks like Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are 'taking a break.' Their engagement is off, and Heidi is going back to Colorado. This is really sad for Heidi and for all the Hills fans and for the entire state of Colorado. || I have a BB gun and a water gun in case things get hectic. I wouldnt put it past Kanye to run up on stage and interrupt me, but good luck with that. || Everyone, calm down. I met with Mr. Cent about a potential project. There's nothing to report yet, I'll let you know if there is. || You get photographed together when there's 25 people with you and people assume that you're having sex, which is definitely not the case. || It became clear when I got in my car that Persians are only really good for two things. Oil and hummus. || I had to feign interest in all this nonsense until I could ask when I could come over and sit on his face. I didn't say that out loud, of course. I never say the things I really want to. If I did, I'd have no friends. || I have more respect for somebody who's like, 'Yeah I like to party, so screw off,' then for Tara , who talks about not partying and ends up passed out underneath a Subway, not a subway station, but the actual sandwich shop - two days later. || They travel in groups. You never see an Asian by their self. || When you see the veins popping out of my neck, that's an exclamation point. || It's hard to tell these days what gender people are. You don't know if they're gay, if they're straight, or Bruce Jenner. || I was tortured, and probably half of it was deserved, but I was bullied - so much so that there were days when I was like, 'I can't go to school today.' I was too scared. || I think we can all agree that sleeping around is a great way to meet people. || We went to a Barnes and Noble, where I picked up an unauthorized biography of M.C. Hammer, and not wanting to overload her on her first book, I steered Dumb Dumb toward a Choose Your Own Adventure. || Tara Reid is charging $3,500 for a personal appearance fee. So, for only $3,500 you can either buy a 1998 Jetta with 130,000 miles on it... or Tara Reid, who only has 98,000 miles on her. || Rumer Willis was having a great time at the opening of a club when her twin walked in, also known as her dad, Bruce Willis. How embarrassing for her, she’s out with her friends and they’re like, ‘Umm, Rumer, I think your dad put something in my drink.’ || David Hasselhoff was hospitalized after falling off the wagon again. He probably got used to drinking too much, because for years he never had to worry about driving anywhere - his car drove itself. || Have you ever been to an AA meeting? No wonder these people are alcoholics - I've never needed a drink more badly in my life. || I don’t like people who drink decaf coffee it’s like what. Why you drinking it? Like it taste so good? That’s like drinking non alcoholic vodka. || I would never get married while my father is still alive because I wouldn't want him to walk me down the aisle. || Anyone who is friends with Bill Clinton shouldn’t be telling their wife about it. || He's so pissed off 'cause he probably thought he was, like, scoring the biggest deal of his lifetime, getting adopted by this famous movie star, who was gonna rescue him from his third world Cambodia, only to find out she's gonna take him to every other fucking third world country in the world. He's probably like, 'When the fuck are we getting to Malibu like you promised?' || I thought about becoming a lesbian. Those bitches look like they're having a helluva time, don't they? But then you gotta get into the whole lesbian scene, you know, and go buy hiking boots and a truck. And then, who pays for shit? I guess the guy who's watching, but what if he's not there? || I would like to wear a diaper on days where I'm feeling lazy but... I don't. I shit my pants. || Then a homeless man with a dog approached us and put his hand out. This happens to be something that I have a real problem with: homeless people with pets who approach you for food when they have a perfectly delicious dog standing right there? || My negotiation skills are are on par with George Bush's reading ability. And just like Dubya, every time I've tried to put forth an effort, I am reminded that my only true strength lies in drinking. || A Catholic priest who’s been sending threatening notes to Conan O’Brien was charged with stalking in the fourth degree. It just goes to show you that people can become obsessed with redheads. || Every time John Travolta assaults a masseur, a scientologist gets their wings. || I can remember my first one-night stand like it was yesterday. Well, maybe not the first. Or the second... or the fifth. I'll just begin with what I can remember and not concern myself with order. || Why he would agree to install an eight-by-eight-foot fish tank and then not fill it with a single dolphin made me want to burn his eyebrows off. || There are two kinds of people I don't trust: people who don't drink and people who collect stickers. || Or people who have one baby and go buy a minivan... how big is your baby? || Have you ever experienced a pain so sharp in your heart that it's all you can do to take a breath? It's a pain you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy; you wouldn't want to pass it on to anyone else for fear he or she might not be able to bear it. It's the pain of being betrayed by a person with whom you've fallen in love. It's not as serious as death, but it feels a whole lot like it, and as I've come to learn, pain is pain any way you slice it. || So, my dad's like, 'You're not a lesbian, are you?' I'm like, 'No, I'm not a lesbian. I sleep with guys all the time.' He's like, 'Well, you're not a hooker, are you?' I'm like, 'No, I'm not a hooker. I don't charge people.' || I have a question. Do you guys think it's OK to drink while you're pregnant if you're planning on giving the baby up for adoption? || Isn't that just being a whore? You don't need to join a club. Close your legs, sister. || I got a vibrator that needed two nine volt batteries. What am I - R2D2? I don't know what to do with that. || You never think when you're a little girl that you're going to grow up and be the whore. When I was a little girl, I was like, ""Oh my god, I'm gonna wait 'til I go to college to lose my virginity."" I had all these big dreams. Then the third grade just ended up being such a nutty year. || Getting rewarded for being pregnant when you’re a teenager? Are you serious? I mean, that makes me want to kill somebody. || I had an abortion when I was 16. Because that’s what I should have done. Otherwise I would now have a 20-year-old kid. Anyway, those are things that people shouldn’t be dishonest about it. || While looking at a website for liposuction, I learned that it was a six-to eight-week recovery period, the clincher being that, during that time, I would under no circumstances be able to use street drugs. Obviously I had to think of a more realistic approach. || My theory about Taylor Swift is that she's a virgin, that everyone breaks up with her because they date her for two weeks and she's like, 'I'm not gonna do it'. || All he ever talked about was threesomes. He's all like, 'Chelsea, you're really gonna like it. It's really popular in Europe.' I'm like, 'So is David Hasselhoff.' || Look at you, you're handsome... ish. || Well thank you, I can hardly say I'm an 'eloquent' writer, it's like a third grade reading level. || Well, I don't live in the past like you, so I don't remember. || Lindsay Lohan fell in love while in rehab. Who wouldn’t? You share meals together, gaze into each other’s eyes, talk about your feelings and share one romantic sunset after another - for roughly $50,000 a month. Pretty pricey, considering a month of eHarmony.com is only $21. || It’s been my experience that people who make proclamations about themselves are usually the opposite of what they claim to be. If someone is truly a loyal friend, then they wouldn't need to broadcast it; eventually, people will figure it out. I have a lot of good friends and not one of them has ever introduced themselves by saying, ""I'm a very good friend."" || There's a reason you never see anyone's house with a Beware of Cat sign. Because they're not even worth mentioning. || He laid into me with the same gusto as a right-wing political pundit on the O'Reilly Factor defending President's Bush right to vacation six days out of the week. || The problem with the suspenders my mother bought for him is that he hasn't adjusted the straps since he got them. So instead of attaching somewhere around his midsection, the suspenders clip onto his pants three inches below his nipples. Now picture the suspenders attached to sweatpants. This vision is what first led me to coin the term ""camel balls"". || I like to stay at home and sit on my ass. || Obviously, if I was serious about having a relationship with some one long-term, the last people I would introduce him to would be my family. || For the first two seasons, Dr. Phil had everyone believing he wasn't an egotistical jackass. || Is Heather McDonald your best friend? You better get a new one. || If someone took the ‘F’ letter off me, I’d be ucked. || She had Nick Lachey’s body, a deep voice, very small boobies, and a crew cut. It would have come as no surprise if she had walked into the backyard to compete in a rock-hurling competition after dinner. || Who hasn't taken birth control pills to treat menstrual cramps? That's like me going to give a blowjob for menstrual cramps. || It always freaks me out when I go to a sushi place and there's a Mexican. || I recently had sex with a midget. Not on purpose - he was a tricky little fucker. He kept giving me shot after shot after shot of tequila and would keep getting taller and taller and taller. || I met my first midget in Mexico, and he was a waiter with a sombrero on his head, filled with chips and salsa. Like I was gonna let that guy get away - I don't think so. || The only thing worse than dating a single mom is dating a single mom that won't put out. || Today is both the most romantic day of the year and the busiest day of the year for the suicide hotline. || Along with the 97 percent of women who can see, I have never been a fan of redheaded men. || Are you there vodka? It's me, Chelsea. Please get me out of jail and I promise I will never drink again. Drink and drive. I will never drink and drive again. I may even start my own group fashioned after MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, but I'll call it AWLTDASH, Alcoholics Who Like to Drink and Stay Home. || If you get into a customer service fight with a hooker, even if you're in the right, you're in the wrong. || You know that if you leave your underwear on a plane, things did not go the way you intended. || He’s got a Jewish head which means he’s got a Jewish penis... that’s not great || Britney and Christina's careers are nipple to nipple. || My boobs are very muscular! || At some point during almost every romantic comedy, the female lead suddenly trips and falls, stumbling helplessly over something ridiculous like a leaf, and then some Matthew McConaughey type either whips around the corner just in the nick of time to save her or is clumsily pulled down along with her. That event predictably leads to the magical moment of their first kiss. Please. I fall all the time. You know who comes and gets me? The bouncer. || People are always like, ""Oh, she's such a bitch."" I'm like, ""Yeah, I am a bitch, actually."" || And by the way, the fact that she's not speaking to anyone in her family is a pretty good indicator that she is the problem. || Men don't realize that if were sleeping with them on the first date, were probably not interested in seeing them again either. || Listen, Dim Sum, you little fuck fuck, I didn't pay a hundred dollars for a fucking towel rub. || I don't appreciate people who celebrate their dog's birthdays with ""dog parties,"" and then invite their friends who don't even have dogs. I understand why people like dogs, and I think they definitely bring more to the table than cats or those godforsaken ferrets, but I don't think it's healthy for people to treat their dogs like they are real people. || He was all emotion all the time, constantly talking about his feelings and his profound love for her. He was minutes from getting his first period. He wrote poems too. It's my personal belief that if men are writing poems, they're making up for something else like a big hair back, or one ball. Not that one ball is a bad thing. Especially since I don't know any females who are dying to their their hands on a set of balls. The way I see it, the less balls, the better. || I wanted to kick Bruce in the taint. No one is just one thing. Many things contribute to the whole of a person, and just because vodka accounts for 50 percent of my body weight, that doesn't mean I walk around with a vodka drip, forcing every plant, person, or animal to imbibe. I've always had a disliking for animal trainers, and this guy cemented my theory that people who chaperone animals for a living have never had a girl sit on their face. || The show is a behind-the-scenes look at what happens at our office when the cameras are off... A perfect platform for people who have no business being on camera. || We women have to stick together. || It's a pleasure to play my sister because everything I've accused her of my whole life, I can now re-enact before her eyes. || I don't like the word 'alcoholic'. I like to think of myself as an advanced drinker. || This women killer was a testament to my theory that the crazier you are, the more calories you burn. That's why psychos are always so skinny. || Instead of having a baby, why dont you get a tattoo of a baby first, and see how that works out for six months to a year, and then see if you’re ready to have a baby. || If your name is 'Christina' and you spell it 'Xtina', there’s a 99% chance you've given your stepdad a blowjob. || The last time a straight man worked in the fashion industry, we got a fanny pack. || All bitches have a heart. || I hate that people assume guys are the only ones to want sex. Girls want sex, too, and that shouldn't be a problem. || Just because she’s singing about drugs, doesn’t mean she’s doing them. Ricky Martin sings about girls all the time. || Maybe they should name more drugs cute things. I don’t do meth, but maybe if they called meth ‘Stefanie’ I would! || You’re all fucked up and that’s kind of attractive. || Everyone is coming from a place of fear and my feeling is stop being so afraid. If something doesn’t work then that’s fine at least then you know it doesn’t work. Don’t worry so much about it not working, you can always fix that. || I want to start saying bad words all the time! || If you have to work at McDonald's, good for you. But on a side note, good luck with the rest of your life. || If you judge a person by the company they keep, then I'm retarded. || I hate when people refer to themselves as Mommy. Your daughter knows who the fuck you are! || I could blame a lot of my life on alcohol and I don’t. I just know I’m a fucking loser. || Thanksgiving is coming. I wonder what the holiday will be like at Dog the Bounty Hunter’s house - obviously, they’ll have a turkey with all-white meat. || You don’t mess with janitors, first of all, they have like 40 keys, and 1 is to a closet you don’t want to be inside of. || This weekend, Pam Anderson tied the knot with Rick Salomon in Las Vegas. The minister who married them said, ‘Is there anyone here who believes this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony?’ And then he raised his hand. || We usually have margaritas on Thursdays but since it's Tuesday I'll make an exception. || This week Jamie Lynn Spears announced that she's pregnant. I think she should opt for adoption. I would never recommend abortion, unless you've got the punch card filled up, and the eighth one is free. || You got married recently to a rapper. It doesn't take them long to impregnate women. || If you want to have sex with strangers, you have to do it the old fashion way and become a prostitute. || That's what my perfume would smell like, margarita and vodka. || I’m actually pretty good at tennis. Well, if I’m in the Special Olympics or something. || I've never made love to a ghost but I have made love to men who are a few years away from becoming a ghost. || If you do talk dirty, make sure that you enunciate because there's nothing more embarrassing than having to repeat yourself. || Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes reportedly sleep in separate bedrooms of their mansion, because Tom snores. They also have their own bathrooms... in case Katie has to get up in the middle of the night and ask Tom’s permission to pee. || I’m a ridiculous person. If you take anything any comedian says seriously, then you’re stupid. || It's hard on an all-gay softball team because no one knows if they want to be a pitcher or a catcher. || Hispanics still have the highest rate amongst teens with babies so at least the future housekeeping is secure. || Laugh loudly, laugh often, and most important, laugh at yourself. || But then, like George Michael in a men's bathroom, I got cocky. || I don't think the problem is telling people you're on a diet. The problem is eating ice cream for breakfast. || I don't like people who have babies and act like they did something that the rest of us can't figure out. Anybody can have one, OK? I could have had three if I had gone through with any of my pregnancies. || My mother told me that life isn't always about pleasing yourself and that sometimes you have to do things for the sole benefit of another human being. I completely agreed with her, but reminded her that that was what blow jobs were for. || Kiefer Sutherland has agreed to serve 48 days in jail for his DUI convictions. That’s 245 months in Jack Bauer years. || I will probably have sex with Eminem after the show is over. Probably, I don't see why I wouldn't. I'm fair game, its not like I'm that picky, you've seen the guys I've dated. I like Swizz Beatz, just because I would like to yell out in bed, Swizz Beatz! Keep it coming! || I don't mean to be a racist but if you're going to get raped by a Japanese guy, it's not going to hurt at all. || According to the New York Post, Lance Armstrong and Ashley Olsen are dating. They must be getting serious - Lance gave Ashley his yellow Live Strong bracelet. She wears it as a belt. || There are no warning signs on the trampoline. The warning is the trampoline. || I got 11 vibrators for my birthday this year. Do my girlfriends think I'm at home double teaming myself? || How do you think jail was?! I got face raped by a woman... and I think I may have liked it. || Jessica Simpson attended boyfriend Tony Romo’s football game. The Cowboys quarterback had the worst game of his career. It’s a bad year for the name Simpson. Even O. J. is pissed - he feels like they’re making his name look bad. || I like to read naked but only on my iPad so I can use my boob to swipe the page. || ...some of the best sex I can barely remember. || This year Heidi Fleiss will be opening the Stud Farm, her all-male brothel outside of Las Vegas. This is for women to find men. If you’re a guy looking for a guy, you still have to find it at the airport bathroom. || Nothing is more American than stuffing your face with loaded potato skins while drinking loaded mudslides. || ""According to Life & Style Weekly, 50 Cent may be working on Lindsay Lohan’s next album. Finally, a match made in rap heaven. He’s a convicted drug dealer who’s been shot nine times, and she spent 84 minutes in prison. This is a big step for Lindsay. The last time Lindsay got near a black guy she ran over his foot. || The snake is 20 inches long and black so if we need someone to find it, call the Kardashians. || People tend to call me names that I can't repeat on basic cable. I will give you a hint. They rhyme with ""itch,"" ""hunt,"" & ""bore."" || I love a stupid joke, something that doesn't make any sense. || George Clooney and Fabio apparently got into a scuffle at a restaurant in Los Angeles over the weekend. George thought the women with Fabio were taking pictures of him. How embarrassed is George Clooney to be in a fight with Fabio? Who is he going to call out next, Lorenzo Lamas? || If you choose jail over church, you either really hate God or you really love butt rape. || You know what they say, when one door closes, another Belvedere opens. || Austin and I proceeded to knock back a couple of Ketel One and grapefruit juices, which happened to be my drink of the moment. Someone told me that grapefruit was a great detoxifier and I decided I wanted to start cleaning out my liver while I was having a cocktail. || According to an article on CNN.com, a new study says people who are bad kissers don’t get laid. Where are you supposed to learn how to kiss? If you go to Catholic school, it’s from your priest; in public school, you learn from your teacher; and some guys learn from their sisters... if their sister is Angelina Jolie. || We got to his place and it looked a lot like his personality. Just a bunch of space filler, nothing to really wow you. It looked like he had bought a lot of stuff from IKEA and then decided to refinish it at home. Everything was neat and tidy, but you wouldn't want any of it for yourself. || My life and my legs have been an open book. || Everyone knows if you're going to take weed to school, you put it in your trapper keeper to keep it fresh. || My whole life is reading tabloid magazines. It's really sad, because that's what my show is all about, what is going on with celebrities. So I have to know everything. || I haven't been that uncomfortable since I was 13 and my Rabbi tickled my lower back with his beard. || I understand that if you're a kid in Indonesia, you need to smoke because you just got off work at the Nike factory. || The challenge is to keep it fresh. If you're talking about Britney Spears over and over, it's very hard to keep that interesting. || Shamu and I have arrived safely in Costa Rica. He was stopped by airport security because he carries enough artillery in his pants pockets to construct a sawed-off shotgun. Evidently, he though we were headed to Iraq. || I had sex with a couple guys but it wasn't a baseball team. I saved that for my twenties. || There's a good chance I may be an alcoholic. You think guys would be a little more excited about that. All they do is bitch and moan. 'You drink too much. You sleep too much.' It's like, if you were drunk all the time, you'd be tired, too. || My question is - after you've been arrested three or four times, who calls up their friends and goes, 'Hey! Let's get an eight-ball, let's get a bag of weed, let's get a gun, let's get a six-pack and - fuck it - I'll drive!' || Did you hear the new phenomenon that's going on about... letting the boys decide if they want to get circumcised? It's like, OK, it shouldn't be up to the boy. It should be up to the girl, the one that's going to be fucking him in 15 years - that should be her decision. || Kiefer Sutherland is spending the holidays behind bars, so for Christmas he’ll need crossword puzzles, stationery, magazines, a cork and a rape whistle. || Lydia was the kind of friend whom people referred to as a 'party favor' - always fun to be around but she doesn't have any patience for suffering unless it's her own. || Not everyone in school needs to look like a slut but there should always be one... and I enjoyed being her. || According to Life & Style, Lance Armstrong was seen canoodling with fitness model Kim Strother, and the night before, he was with Ashley Olsen. He’s going from bar to bar picking up women - how does he get them home? Does he put them on the handlebars, or does he have a banana seat? || My tendency to make up stories and lie compulsively for the sake of my own amusement takes up a good portion of my day and provides me with a peace of mind not easily attainable in this economic climate. || Paris Hilton is going on a goodwill mission to Rwanda. It's the first time an entire Third World country will have to get immunizations for a visitor. || ""This is no way to run a business,"" I told Dim Sum, and then looked at Tons of Fun. ""And you might want to lay off the carbs, you fucking wildebeest."" || You just be honest about who you are, and if you don’t end up with any friends then good for you. || Britney Spears' album Blackout is one of the hottest-selling CDs in the country. We’re in a bad place, people: The world is melting, we're at war, and Two and a Half Men is a huge hit. || The part that wasn't a jackpot was his baseball mound of red pubic hair that looked like it had literally been attached with a glue gun. I couldn't believe how much there was, and wondered how he had never heard of scissors, or - more appropriate for that kind of growth - hedge trimmers. I didn't understand what porn he was watching to not be aware of the trimming that was happening all across the world among his compatriots. I'm not a finicky person when it comes to pubic hair maintenance and I certainly don't expect men to shave it all off, leaving themselves to look like a hairless cat. That's even creepier then than seeing what Austin had, which could really only be compared to one thing: A clown in a leg lock. || Lance Bass has a new autobiography titled Out of Sync. We don’t need to read it, we already know how it ends - Justin is really successful, and Lance is gay. || My feeling is, if a dog is that hard up to break free, let it go. It's like a boyfriend who wants to break up. We all know the old adage ""If you set someone free, and he never comes back, then he was never yours."" I understand the main fear with setting dogs loose is they could get hit by a car, but so could an ex boyfriend. That's just a chance you have to take. || If your back hurts because of your man purse, guess what else hurts? Your vagina. || I have no idea why gay men love me, but I would have to assume it's because they know how much I love the gays! Everyone needs a good gay man in their life. || Angelina Jolie’s older brother James Haven, the one she made out with, has a license plate on his SUV that reads Shiloh. Maybe it’s not that weird. After all, he could be the father. || My father has a high opinion of his opinion. || Christina Aguilera finally announced her pregnancy. Thanks for waiting until your third trimester to get the word out - why not just wait until you’re crowning? || Good Luck Chuck, a comedy starring Dane Cook and Jessica Alba, opened today, and critics are saying it has all the belly laughs you’ve come to expect from Jessica Alba. || Ivory's the kind of girl who gets drunk and immediately starts slurring. I have a lot of friends like that, and I think it's because it makes me look more together. || Hulk Hogan’s wife has filed for divorce. This is the most devastating breakup since Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee. And then Pam Anderson and Kid Rock. And soon, Pam Anderson and Rick Salomon. || Our relationship finally ended when he took to waking me up in the wee hours o the morning when he would go surfing. He thought it might be fun to have me come watch. ""Fun for who?"" I wanted to ask. I had never asked him to come to Happy Hour and watch me drink."
Chris Hardwick,"You don't have to believe everything you think. || So what happens when nerds all get rich is: there’s a politics to it. Where there is money there is power. So then everyone else is like: “Hey nerds are great!” || Stand up straight. If you stand up straight, you will instantly feel better about yourself, and you will project a better image to the world, one that says you don't feel like you have to be hunched over and closed off. || Fleetwood Mac is just one of my all-time favorite bands. || The difference being that a nerd would wear a D&D shirt because he loves D&D while a hipster would wear a D&D shirt because it’s ridiculous that he is wearing a D&D shirt. || When you don't take an aggressive role in shaping your thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, you become a helpless passenger floating through the universe like a ghost ship, merely reacting to wherever it takes you. || Long ago you may have given up control of your brain and set it on autopilot either because it just felt like too much work. And it is work! But for me, this work was well worth it for the prospect of not waking up sad every day. || It’s very easy to attack ourselves. Even comforting in its familiarity, but you must resist this urge at all costs. Dwelling on the past or your perceived flaws will do nothing but keep you under emotional house arrest and hamper your progress. Commit yourself to growth and reward yourself with kindness for choosing to do so! || A lot of people complain in the year 2003 that it's not the world of tomorrow as foreseen in the 1950s. 'Where are the flying cars?' people say. 'Where are the robots who bring us blue drinks and warn us of danger?' Alright. We don't have those things, specifically, folks, but you know what we do have? Laser vaginal rejuvenation surgery. || If you’re able to build from your falls you’ll be unstoppable and damn near fearless. You see, every time you fall down and get back up, you add another piece of body armor to yourself. You learn what not to do, how to do better, and how to create comfort through practice. || I realized my penis is like a retarded little brother. It means well, but ultimately it's driven by curiosity and the need to be hugged. || Humans cannot produce viable offspring with our closest animal cousin: the chimpanzee. We cannot impregnate a chimp. So you know what that means? No condoms. || She goes, 'You just took me bowling to impress me.' 'Well, yes. Another strike for me. Are you ready for my seed yet, or should I move on to juggling?' || You can't touch the strippers. Why are you paying to not touch someone? That is weird. How do you win in that situation? That is like walking into a deli, starving, and being like, 'Here's $300 - can I stare at the roast beef? Better yet, I'll sit down in this chair and you can mash it around my mouth and balls.' || Yeah you may have fucked up today, but you can still not fuck up tomorrow. || There are certain parts of a classic nerd’s brain that can destroy that person - obsessing about things to the detriment of everything else in your life. But those are the same tools that you can use to turn everything around. || You don’t have to go from zero to… the Dos Equis guy. You can take smaller steps. || Do you think Patrick Swayze now goes up behind people in pottery classes and hugs them just to crack up other ghosts? || The war is over. The Nerds have won. This was no accident. || Alcohol is like pouring smiles on your brain. || All boys' Catholic school is a lot like going to a regular school, except your teacher is a priest - with benefits. No, I'm kidding. I was never touched by any priest in school. Which makes me think, 'Am I not attractive?' || Kids who are the product of old sperm are not right. The fresher the mayo, the better the sandwich. That is a very simple formula. || Ah, self-confidence. You fickle, fickle slut, you. Sometimes you’re there, other times you’re with some other jerk, nowhere to be found. The idea of self-confidence is irritating the way it’s usually presented, like it’s some tangible ‘thing’ you can just throw onto your brain like a jacket. || No human ever became interesting by not failing. The more you fail and recover and improve, the better you are as a person. Ever meet someone who’s always had everything work out for them with zero struggle? They usually have the depth of a puddle. Or they don’t exist. || Jokes that make me laugh out loud when I write them almost always bomb. I have no idea why. || I honestly think hipsters eat with their assholes because they consume everything wrong. || I have the greatest respect for your culture; I think you guys do it properly. You have your three or four kids and then you slow down so you can enjoy your late teens. || Worry is a misuse of your imagination. || It’s so much easier to give advice than to take it. || Mainstream culture is like your mom: It’s always a little late to catch on and gets easily confused by technology, but it means well. || I do podcasts for the same reasons I do stand-up comedy. I love it, and I don’t care if anybody else gets it. || All television is an advertisement - that’s why it exists. It wasn’t the art-form first and then the commerce - it was that they could put on entertainment long enough to distract people into looking at products. It’s for focusing people on advertising and separating you from money in some way. Some people forget that. The side product is that we get some great eye candy. TV is the best it has ever been right now. I don’t have a problem with that since it’s what keep us employed. || There’s no ironic appreciation of things we love, even of things that are in fact ridiculous, which a hipster might take and own and show the world the humor in it. || The thing about hipsters is that they take very seriously trying to make themselves look like they don’t take themselves seriously. || Sober strip clubs are horrible. When you are sober you see the matrix code behind a strip club. You're paying girls to pretend to like you until you run out of money so they can walk away. || Steal moments of happiness if you have to, and then collect them until they are the dominant images in your psyche. || There's not many a man who would get shot and then come visit the family responsible. || I get stressed out hearing Lindsey Buckingham talk about those days cause what I'm thinking... I don't know how he can't go 'And that's right before Mick Fleetwood fucked my girlfriend. || Ultimately, it's the best decision I've ever made in my life. There's an economy of energy that you have in your life. You just have to devote it to things that are good for you, for the most part, that's more constructive than drinking. And one of them doesn't end in uncontrollable vomiting and crying... || I'm going to start referring to anal sex as ""getting accepted to Brown"". || It changed my whole outlook. I lost a decade to self-pity, and the next thing I knew I was turning 40. || I dated around some, but I've always been a serial monogamist. I don't know how people date around a lot, and not want to stab themselves in the face with a sharp object. || You walk into a strip club with a wad of cash; they all flock around you. Strippers are just pigeons with tits. They go where the bread is. || When I was in grade school I was into chess club, Latin club, D&D, computer camp - everything that made vaginas go away. || This was in the 80's, when you couldn't just take a pill the next day to Control + Z that shit. || I couldn't do sports and so in my head I was like, 'Ladies will see my hand to hand dexterity and they will want these hands inside them.' First of all, flawed, you're juggling balls. || Be offended by everything or be offended by nothing. || No matter what tricks you use or what decisions you make, go easy on yourself as someone who’s on a never-ending quest for improvement. || Playing Xbox for 23 hours straight is cool and all, but I’m going to teach you how to spend time on things in your life that will get you the following two things: paid and laid. || Don't try to talk to me about sports. If a guy comes up and starts spitting out stats and what happened in the most recent game, to me, all he's saying is: 'Hey let's punch each other in the cock right after we pound these energy drinks out of a douche while we fuck our Ed Hardy t-shirts at dickhead camp.' || Never go online to self-diagnose. Ever. Don’t fucking do it. || If you wish to achieve any success in this life, do your best to surround yourself with an orgy of good choices. || I was worried if I got my driver’s license I’d start winning all the NASCAR races. || I wanted her in a bad way, though I wasn’t sure exactly for what. Had she one day suddenly turned and yelled, “Jam it in!” at me, I’m not convinced I’d have known what to do. || Hang out with the worst people imaginable while they’re all in “fuck it!” mode - Vegas! || A “Nerd” is someone who homes in on a topic to an almost quantum detail, much of the time at the expense of healthy social interaction. || Ladies, I will fuck you with my second place chess trophy. I have a first place chess trophy but the second place has the bishop on top - and that is for you. || Rats are just Ziploc bags full of disease. || Being constructively critical is good, as long as your purpose is to improve your methods for future endeavors. Lying in bed and replaying failures and telling yourself you’re stupid is a tremendous disservice to your efforts and what you can offer the world."
Chris Rock,"Do you know what the good side of crack is? If you're up at the right hour, you can get a VCR for $1.50. You can furnish your whole house for $10.95. || 'Cause every woman in here, ever since you were … every guy you met has been trying to fuck you. That's right. || I used to work at McDonald's making minimum wage. You know what that means when someone pays you minimum wage? You know what your boos was trying to say? ""Hey if I could pay you less, I would, but it's against the law."" || Never go to clubs with metal detectors. Sure it feels safe inside. But what about all those niggas waiting outside with guns? They know you ain't got one. || There's a lot of racism going on. Who's more racist, black people or white people? It's black people! You know why? Because we hate black people too! Everything white people don't like about black people, black people really don't like about black people. || I'm never proper or careful, but I never curse in front of my mother, either. || If you said more words to him than ""mommy'll be back"", he might know something! || I used to have horrible cars that would always end up broken down on the highway. When I tried to flag someone down, nobody stopped. But if I pushed my own car, other drivers would get out and push with me. If you want help, help yourself - people like to see that. || Women would rule the world - if only they'd stop bitchin' about each other. || If you haven't contemplated murder, you ain't been in love. If you haven't seriously thought about killing a motherfucker, you ain't been in love. || Doctors don't cure shit! They don't cure shit! The last disease doctors cured was polio, when's the last time you met someone with polio? || White man makes guns? No problem. Black rapper says ""guns""? Congressional hearing. ""Oh, my God, that nigger said gun, and he rhymed it with fun""! || So you gotta look at OJ's situation. He's paying $25,000 a month in alimony, got another man driving around in his car and fucking his wife in a house he's still paying the mortgage on. Now I'm not saying he should have killed her... but I understand. || Fellas, when you wake up in the morning, you should look yourself in the mirror and say, ""Fuck you! Fuck your hopes, fuck your dreams, fuck your plans … fuck everything you thought this life was going to bring to you. Now let's go out there and try to make this bitch happy."" || I love having somebody there - that companion thing. You know who you're going to eat with, who you're going to see a movie with. || I do what I can do when I can do it. || We got so much food in America we're allergic to food. Allergic to food! Hungry people ain't allergic to shit. You think anyone in Rwanda's got a fucking lactose intolerance?! || When I do stand-up, I'm basically doing a one-man show. || The key to staying together is making sure you guys like each other and need each other. || Kids always act up the most before they go to sleep. || Karaoke isn't fair when you're a comedian. The whole idea is to get people laughing and enjoying themselves, and I'm a professional funny guy. || I used to have horrible cars that would always end up broken down on the highway. When I tried to flag someone down, nobody stopped. But if I pushed my own car, other drivers would get out and push with me. If you want help, help yourself - people like to see that. || The best part is just having a partner. There is no real worst part. I'm not going to say there's a worst part. I mean I'm a comedian - comedians like to work alone. So maybe I'm not the ideal guy to be married to, in that sense. || Relationships, easy to get into, hard to maintain. Why are they so hard to maintain? Because it’s hard to keep up the lie! ‘Cause you can’t get nobody being you. You got to lie to get somebody. || I like talking about subjects that aren't funny in the first place and making them funny. So anything down and depressing is something I'll talk about. || You'd got a baseball game, or a football game, basketball game, ""USA! USA! USA!"" Hey, calm down! Got a little German on it, don't you think? || When you die at 72, no matter what you die of, it's natural causes. Even if you get hit by a truck, it's natural causes. 'Cause if you was younger, you'd have got out the way! || I think pretty soon people gonna be fuckin' for gas. I think people already fuckin' for gas. Some of y'all in here tonight are fuckin' for gas. Like 'Girl, why you with him?' He filled up my tank. || Even if you meet the perfect person, it ain't gonna be at the perfect time. You're married, they're single. That's right. You're Jewish, they're Palestinian. You're a Mexican, they're a raccoon. You're a black woman, he's a black man. || If you can keep your son off the pipe and your daughter off the pole, you're ahead of the game. || You can be married and bored, or single and lonely. Ain't no happiness nowhere. || Black people yelling ""racism!"" White people yelling ""reverse racism!"" Chinese people yelling ""sideways racism!"" And the Indians ain't yelling shit, 'cause they dead. So everybody bitching about how bad their people got it: nobody got it worse than the American Indian. Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. || Actually, I think all addiction starts with soda. Every junkie did soda first. But no one counts that. Maybe they should. The soda connection is clear. Why isn't a presidential commission looking into this? Or at least some guys from the National Carbonation Council. || I live in a neighborhood so bad that you can get shot while getting shot. || People are starving all over the world, what do you mean, ""red meat will kill you""? Don't eat no red meat? No, don't eat no green meat. If you lucky enough to get your hands on a steak, bite the shit out of it! || I was bused to a school in Gerritsen Beach in Brooklyn in 1972. I was one of the first black kids in the history of the school. || Women are like the police, they could have all the evidence in the world but they still want the confession. || All people naturally hate. My kid bites people now. I didn't teach my kid to bite anybody. Kids say mean stuff. Only through love do we get this evil out of them. Only through love and structure and discipline do they not hate. The kids that hate didn't learn anything, that's the problem. || It's beautiful that abortion is legal in America. I love going to abortion rallies to pick up women, 'cause you know they're fucking. You ain't gonna find a bunch of virgins at the abortion rally. You might even see some clear heels! || A black C student can't do shit with his life. A black C student can't be a manager at Burger King. Meanwhile, a white C student just happens to be the President of the United States. || I'm watching the news … Tupac Shakur was assassinated, Biggie Smalls assassinated, struck down by assassin's bullets … no, they wasn't. Martin Luther King was assassinated, Malcolm X was assassinated, John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Them two niggas got shot! Shit, I love Tupac, I love Biggie, but school will be open on their birthday. || I always say there's no more little girls, just boys with breasts. Girls act like boys nowadays. Teenage girls, they go after boys. They're predatory just like boys. My goal is to keep my girls, girls. || Every time a man's being nice to women, he's offering you dick. || George Bush hates midgets. || You know the stripper myth? There's a stripper myth, that's being perpetuated throughout society. The myth is, I'm strippin' to pay my tuition. No you're not! There's no strippers in college! There's no clear heels in biology! Shit, man. I didn't know they had a college that only took one-dollar bills. And if they got so many strippers at college, how come I never got a smart lap dance? I never got a girl that sat on my lap and said, If I was you, I would diversify my portfolio. You know, ever since the end of the Cold War, I find NATO obsolete!. || It's hard for a man to turn down sex … if they chase us, we can't run that fast. || School shootings were invented by blacks... and stolen by the white man. || Gun control? We need bullet control! I think every bullet should cost 5,000 dollars. Because if a bullet cost five thousand dollar, we wouldn't have any innocent bystanders. || If you see a black woman with an overweight white man, you know she got effed up credit! || You won't be able to take your eyes off the next four presenters: Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz. || It's no different. It's not like I ever cursed around my mother or anything. I never had a hard time turning it on and off. It's like you enter another country - sometimes you're in a cursing country and then you're in a kid's country. || I'm happy if everybody else is. I'm a big brother, the oldest. If you're happy and I'm not, I'm cool with that. If I'm happy and you're not, I'm sad. || I'll go back to comedy clubs when they get a real no-camera policy, the same way they did with smoking. || America is the only place where people go hunting on a full stomach. || Here's what I knew about doing a play: I knew it would make me a better actor. || I love my life, but I don't think I'm any happier than my younger brother Andre, who drives a garbage truck. || I'm like the Hulk on stage. It's way over the top. That's Bizarro Chris. Sometimes I get off stage and go ""What did I say?!"" I'll watch one of my stand-up specials a year later and go ""Eww, that was mean."" || I've been married for 10 years and, you know, it's hard, you spruce it up and you go places. How do you spruce up anything? Artificially. You go places and do things. || Gay people got a right to be as miserable as everybody else. || You can only offend me if you mean something to me. || I'm severely overrated. I'm just above a hack. || If you properly clean a room, it gets dirtier before it gets cleaner. || I love music. Music is the soundtrack to the crappy movie that is my life. || You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, Germany doesn't want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named ""Bush"", ""Dick"", and ""Colin."" Need I say more? || Anyone who makes up their mind about an issue before they hear the issue is a fool. || A bunch of girls say, ""You don't need no man to help you raise no child"" … shut the fuck up with the bullshit! Yeah, you could do it without a man, but that don't mean it's to be done! Shit, you can drive a car with your feet if you want to, that don't make it a good fucking idea! || I just thought everybody lived around abandoned buildings and crack-heads. I lived in the ghetto until I was like 19. I came to Los Angeles, stayed at hotels and stuff. When I got back and I saw what my neighborhood looked like, I started getting scared. || I was raised to believe that you had to do things better than white people in order to succeed. The old black shows were better than the white shows. The Jeffersons was a lot better. Good Times was way funnier. Sanford and Son. Now, though, everyone thinks we're equal, so we submit the same s... that everyone else submits. And then we get mad when they won't air it. You got to go back to the old attitude of it has to be twice as good. || You want to track Hollywood careers, look in the real estate section. You see a guy buy a house that costs $6 million, and you can literally start counting the days until he starts doing crappy movies. || Daddy pays for the water, daddy pays for the gas, daddy pays for the electricity, and if daddy didn't pay for the electricity, he'd pay for the candle on your nightstand, so you can study for the big test tomorrow. || I was at Michael Jackson's house, and this kid runs out, 'Wait, save me!' || It's just sad to see some white person trying to do a nigger-less rendition of a Dr. Dre song. It's just fuckin' depressing. || Guys play characters that won't grow up and something catastrophic happens and they have to grow up to save the day - that's pretty much what today's comedy is about. || I don't write jokes first. I write down topics. I think of what I want to talk about, and then I write the jokes - they don't write me... And even if you don't think it's funny, you won't think it's boring. You might disagree, but you'll listen. And maybe even laugh as you disagree. || It's weird with stand-up comedy. It doesn't really translate worldwide. I want to figure out how do I make it worldwide. Do a special in Africa. Can't beat that. Pull that off, then I will have done something. || I'm a rap comedian the same way Bill Cosby is a jazz comedian, Cosby's laid back. I'm like, bang, bang bang, right into it. || I just remember that whenever I got really mad or passionate, like in an argument, people would laugh, and I'd be dead serious. It would happen a lot. So it was like, ""Gee, I've got something here."" || The material comes from whenever you realize that you and someone else have something in common. So any conversation you've had more than once, anything you see happening to you that you see happening to a friend, you go, ""Hmmm, that's a situation I can make funny."" || I ain't shooting nobody, so call me a faggot. When the war's over, I'll be the faggot with two legs. || Nothing more racist than a old black man, you know why? 'Cause the old black man went through some real racism. He ain't go through that ""I can't get a cab"" shit. He was the cab! White man just jump on his back: ""Main Street!"" || You know what they say, ""There's no reason to ever hit a woman."" Shit! There's a reason to hit everybody. You just don't do it. Shit, there's a reason to kick an old man down a flight of stairs. You just don't do it. Ain't nobody above an ass-whooping. || Charlie Brown is the one person I identify with. C.B. is such a loser. He wasn't even the star of his own Halloween special. || I mean, they don't grade fathers. But if your daughter's a stripper, you fucked up. || You got a gun, you don't have to work out. || I took my AlDS test. You start reflecting... You start thinking about every nasty, skank-ass... It's like the movie Scrooge, and the Ghost of Pussy Past comes. || I don't get high, but sometimes I wish I did. That way, when I messed up in life I would have an excuse. But right now there's no rehab for stupidity. || Gas is getting so expensive I'm gonna ride a mexican to work. || I never wanted to churn it out. Comedians tend to work all the time. They never put it down like musicians who might make an album then take three or four years off to recharge their batteries. Comedians tend to work straight through and they get stale because of that. Even when I didn't have a lot of money I never ever did it unless I had something new to say. || Before I was a comedian, I thought the coolest thing that would happen to me was to be a teenager. Boy, was I wrong. || You know, just right place right time, lucked up. Thank God for animation. I can turn down a lot of movies now. || For me, anything goes when I pick up a mike. I'm not trying to hurt people - I try not to get too personal - but I look at myself as a reporter. If you can report on anything that has to do with pop culture, then why can't I make jokes about it? Yes, it hurts. But I figure that laughter sometimes starts from pain. You might wince, but then I know that I'm doing my job. The only thing I can do wrong is not be funny. || Nobody's good. I hate it. I truly hate it. I mean, there's a lot of guys doing stuff I admire, but stand-up-wise I feel very alone. I really miss Bill Hicks. I wish I could have put him on my show. And I really miss Sam Kinison a lot. Richard Pryor's sick... It's like you get here and then, oh wait a minute, there's nobody here any more. I feel like the guy who finally got into Studio 54, three years too late, ""Duh, where are all the famous people?"" || I pride myself on being the guy who can do Def Comedy Jam and Charlie Rose. And do well on both. || The only reaction that frightens me is people not laughing. It's extraordinary to me when you get a laugh. That you can go in front of a bunch of people you never met before, you can say some stuff and they all laugh in unison - that's amazing. It's a miracle. || Nobody really wants to be a stand-up, they want to get on TV. || There's no interference in stand-up. It's all the things it's hard to get in film: I get to have a wife, I get to have kids. I get to be sexual. I get to grow. I get to be a man. || I think if I were to get as big as I could get, it does change your mind-state. I think like the little man. I think like the underdog. I don't want to change that. || I don't think my comedy is that political. It's more social. But whatever. When you make comedy and you do stand-up, you work alone. Movies have to go under so much scrutiny. A stand-up special is a vision, and a movie is a consensus in a lot of ways. || Every comedian has a moment in his life when he realizes he's a little bit different from everyone else. It's like being the only guy in a movie who sees the ghost. The ghost talks to you and you talk to him. Then you turn to your friend and say, ""Hey. Do you see that ghost?"" And he says, ""What ghost?"" || I like the tradition of the Oscars. I like that some of the greatest comedians ever have hosted the show. || How do I say this without sounding like an egomaniac? I don't know a comedian that sells more seats than me in the red states and blue states, so I don't see where I have to change that much. || Two hours of sparkling entertainment spread out over a four-hour show. || I've seen women who don't have great relationships with their dads, and it all comes down to this: You have to tell girls you love them every day. || Black people dominate sports in the United States. 20% of the population and 90% of the final four. || Once you're married, kiss all your dreams good-bye and ""make the bitch happy."" Good relationship is simply eating and fucking. || Nobody's about saving anymore. No one cares about a rainy day anymore. Nobody saves up enough for even an umbrella for a rainy day. It's sad. It really is a new form of slavery. We used to work to be able to afford material things. Now we work for these things. They're the boss. That house you can't afford, that car that's out of your price range, that cellphone that drains your bank account - that's your boss. || Who's judging American Idol? Paula Abdul? Paula Abdul judging a singing contest is like Christopher Reeve judging a dance contest! || I'm an independent, but I got to admit I lean Democratic. || I think my best work is when I'm kind of in charge. || I live way below my means. || I can't cook, but I have a nice book of menus... and I can plate and set the table. || Men lie the most. Men lie all the time. || Comedy is a group activity, a verbal orgy. || Anything you can suck at should make you nervous. || America is the greatest country in the whole world. || A comedy club is a place where you work out material, you're trying material. || Only married people understand you can be miserable and happy at the same time. || A sense of humor is great - it goes a long, long way in a marriage. || You don't pay taxes - they take taxes. || When I hear people talk about juggling, or the sacrifices they make for their children, I look at them like they're crazy, because 'sacrifice' infers that there was something better to do than being with your children. || You know what GED stands for? Good Enough Diploma. || Everybody's so busy wanting to be down with the gang. ""I'm conservative"", ""I'm liberal"", ""I'm conservative"". Bullshit! Be a fucking person! Lis-ten! Let it swirl around your head. Then form your opinion. No normal, decent person is one thing, okay? I've got some shit I'm conservative about, I've got some shit I'm liberal about. Crime, I'm conservative. Prostitution, I'm liberal! || Comedians tend to find a comfort zone and stay there and do lamer versions of themselves for the rest of their career. || All you crazy white people ""I'm American!"", all you did was come out of your mother's pussy on American soil. That's it. That's it! What, you think you're better than somebody from France 'cause you came out of a pussy in Detroit? || Most parts in comedy, they're not really written for men. They're written for, like, these boy-men. || My first year on 'SNL', I made $90,000 dollars. || It's got some heart, but it's got hard jokes. I care more about the hard jokes than the heart. || Oh the abortion issue, it's a woman's issue. When a woman get pregnant, she don't want to hear shit from the man. Fuck you, motherfuck you, I don't need you. Unless she decides to have the baby and she's like, ""Where my check?"" || So if you're black or brown, you can make money in America, you can get rich in America … but whatever you decide to do, it better be positive, 'cause if one person is harmed, you will be destroyed. You see Oprah, she just be giving away money. She's doing that to keep the Feds off her back. || Whenever I go out with other married couples, I like to bring along a single crackhead. Just to spice things up. || Women hate women. You get any two girlfriends in this room, been girlfriends for twenty five years, you put a man in between them … ""fuck that bitch,"" ""fuck that bitch."" || You know the only thing you can do to stop your man from cheating? The only thing you can do … is be there. Where? There! Wherever he's thinking about fucking, that's it. Just be right there. And even then he still might lose your ass. He's like, ""Honey, look! A Sale! Let me go fuck this bitch right now!"" || Do you know? What the fuck do women want? l know what you want: everything. || Only a woman can make you feel wrong for doing something right. || You cannot win in a fight against women, cause men have a need to make sense. || Movies have takes. But plays are like life - you don't really get takes. || You know, some people say life is short and that you could get hit by a bus at any moment and that you have to live each day like it's your last. Bullshit. Life is long. You're probably not gonna get hit by a bus. And you're gonna have to live with the choices you make for the next fifty years. || You can write a great country record and still be angry. Who's angrier than Toby Keith? He's angrier than the average 10 rappers. || Welcome to the 77th and last Oscars. || Sometimes people offer you plays, they offer you parts, but they only offer it because I'm famous. || Right now, my job is that I'm like an ambulance chaser. I've got to look for movies with white guys falling out of them. || Pretty girls have problems too. || Now that I have children, I realize taking care of my children is more fun than anything in the whole world. || No film critic's going to say it, but 'Madagascar 3' is better than 'The Artist.' || My movies are okay, but they're not my specials. || My goal in life was to host the MTV Awards, because it's the awards show that Prince sang on, and that was the awards show that Eddie Murphy hosted and Arsenio hosted. || You don't need a critic to tell you people aren't laughing. || If it's all white, it's all right! || Not a Harvard-type education, just a not-sticking-up-a-liquor-store-type education. || If you wanna get away with murder, all you gotta do is shoot somebody in the head and put a demo tape in their pocket! ""This is a rap killing. Let's go home!"" || Dude, I didn't say Jude Law can't act. I didn't say Jude Law was in bad movies. I just said he's in every movie. || By the time I was 7 or 8, I wanted to be a comedy writer. || Bill Cosby was the first comedian I was exposed to, because he doesn't curse. || After I left high school and got my GED, I studied broadcast journalism for a year at a community college. || Funny is only something that others know about you - you can't be funny by yourself. || Yeah, I love being famous. It's almost like being white, y'know? || Everyone has favorite criminals. Mine are pimps. We can all rob a bank; we can all sell drugs. Being a pimp is a whole other thing. || Every town has the same two malls: the one white people go to and the one white people used to go to. || If a woman tells you she's twenty and looks sixteen, she's twelve. If she tells you she's twenty-six and looks twenty-six, she's damn near fourty. || A man is only as faithful as his options. || You know those guys that eat at the strip club? Eat the buffet? How the fuck could you eat on a nasty-ass strip club? What? Are you that hungry? Motherfucker, go to Mickey D's or some shit! Not even Rwandan refugees won't eat that shit! At a damn strip club! Titties and Tater Tots don't mix! || If a kid calls his grandma ""Mommy"" and his mama ""Pam"", he's going to jail! || There are people who would like to get rid of minimum wage. But we have to have it, because if we didn't some people would not get paid money. They would work all week for two loaves of bread and some Spam. || Whoever you hate will end up in your family. You don't like gays? You're gonna have a gay son. You don't like Puerto Ricans? Your daughter's gonna come home with Livin' La Vida Loca! || The government hates rap. That's why they don't arrest anybody that kills rappers! Only the good ones are dead, man! Only the good ones: Biggie dead, Tupac dead, Vanilla Ice still alive! They don't fill out a police report. They don't even have a chalk line when it's a dead rapper, they just take a piss around the body. || This movie's so good I gotta bust a cap in it! || You can never make a woman happy, it's impossible. I've never met a happy woman in my life. They're always complaining about something. || George Bush has fucked up so bad, he made it hard for a white man to run for president! People are like ""give me a black man, a white woman, a giraffe, a zebra... anything but another white man! That last one fucked up my roof!"" || If you vote against Obama because he can't get stuff done, it’s kind of like saying 'This guy can’t cure cancer. I’m gonna vote for cancer.' || Relationships are hard, man. For order, for any relationship to work, both people have to be on the same page, both people have to have the same focus, and we all know what that page is. We all know what that focus is. In order for the relationship to work both people have to have the same focus, and what's that focus? That focus is all about her! It's all about her! || Only dumb people try to impress smart people. Smart people just do what they do. || I'm in show business... I want to hang out with Janet Jackson, not Jesse Jackson. || Whatever your woman is into, you better be into. Whatever your man is into, you better be into. Your partner into church, you better be into church. Your man or woman a crackhead, you better be a crackhead. Otherwise it just won't work. || ""What's in the tea?"" ""Water, bitch!"" || Men lie the most, women tell the biggest lies. || Comedy is the blues for people who can’t sing. || A white boy that makes C's in college can make it to the White House. || If you live with a single parent, you don't see compromise. You witness a grown person living in a world where they do what they want to do. When you are raised by two parents, you are constantly watching compromise take place. Just by observing that, it made me a better person. || You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips. || You know those guys that go to the strip club at the daytime? If you're at a strip club, and the sun is out, you got some problems! || I hate niggas! I hate em! I wish they'd let me join the Ku Klux Klan! || I'm a nerd. I'm a little guy... the last guy you'd expect in a romantic movie. || That's right, ""tell your mama"", ""tell your mama"", ""tell your mama"" … nobody tells daddy shit! || Wealth is not about having a lot of money; it's about having a lot of options. || Hollywood's just not funny. || A black man failing black history... ain't that some sad shit..... cuz you know, fat people don't fail cooking! || If you're black, you got to look at America a little bit different. You got to look at America like the uncle who paid for you to go to college, but who molested you. || Black movies don't have real names, they have names like Barbershop. That's not a name, that's just a location. || When you're white, the sky's the limit. When you're black, the limit's the sky. || Community college is like a disco with books: ""Here's ten dollars; let me get my learn on!"" || There are only three things women need in life: food, water, and compliments. || I had a cop pull me over the other day, scared me so bad, made me think I stole my own car. ""Get out of the car, get out of the fucking car! You stole this car!"" I was like 'damn, maybe I did!'. || It's my real name. My mother's name is Rose Rock. It was the worst name as a kid to have. They called me Piece of the Rock, Plymouth Rock, Joe Rockid, and Flintstones. Now they call me Mister Rock."
Chris Tucker,"This summer I just practiced real hard. I was real dedicated. I don't think I missed two or three workouts this whole summer. || It was like a family reunion, watching the movie. It's always a good feeling when I can get a screening for my family. || I couldn't tell people what I wanted to do because I was from Atlanta. You don't tell people you're gonna be a comedian in Atlanta. That means you ain't gonna do nothing. || A black President? Now come on y'all, we got Clinton, that's close. He got negro tendencies. || You loan your friend money. You see them again, they don't say nothin' 'bout the money. 'Hi, how ya doin'? How's ya mama doing?' Man, how's my money doin'? || IRS officials calling you acting like you owe them the money personally! I don’t owe you shit! This is between me and the company! || I get on stage and talk about different stuff in my life and what I’ve been through and what I think about the world. It’s picking out highlights of things and how I became who I am and how my daddy raised me. || I love to talk about people I've met being an entertainer. All my encounters in life - I roll it all into an hour and 30 minutes. || I told a joke and people laughed and it was the best feeling. I knew I wanted to do this as a career. I never knew I could get such a high from telling a joke. There’s something so extraordinary about having people listening to you and hanging onto your words - it’s a great feeling. || I wasn't feeling it, really. But I just had to do what I had to do. It turned out the better for me. || I couldn't imagine not having clean water. || I really loved what I was doing being creative and being funny as a stand-up comedian. || I think my life is a movie and your life reflects your work. || You don't know who you messing with man, I slap people for fun. That's what I do man! You wanna play rough, huh, I kill for fun! || I'ma beat the puberty outta ya! You ain't gonna see it coming. || I wanted to cut down on the profanity, because I think I'm funnier without sayin' a lot of cuss words. || You know, we're missing so much as African-Americans and we should be concerned about what's going on in Africa. || You aint 180lbs. You weight more than a damn car girl. || It takes intelligence to make real comedy, and it takes a reality base to create all that little stuff I like to do that makes you giggle inside. || Jackie come to me and says, 'We gonna do a fight scene.' I said 'What?' He says 'We got to do a fight scene in the next scene. I have to teach you.' I say 'How you gonna teach me in three seconds?' What we did, we did the fight scene with our arms connected. || We can only comment on what we've seen, and what we've seen from the Chilean government is nothing at all. || You see people waving. You don't see people having problems, with each other at least. || What!? You tell people that, I won't get no more black movies? || I like LA. LA is cool, but it ain't like home. Atlanta is home. All my friends are here, I grew up here. But LA is cool. Its more like a big office. Its work and you work, and you're meetin' people all the time, but its more like acquaintances than friends and stuff.I wanted to cut down on the profanity, because I think I'm funnier without sayin' a lot of cuss words. || You got to control your own destiny. You got to keep writin different stuff. Keep switchin up and never do the same thin too many times. || They came out very prepared and we missed lot of tackles. We have to start on Monday and watch the film. I kept asking what was happening. They just out-competed us. || Making people laugh is giving, and it's healing, too, when people can go up to the movies and forget about their problems. It's a good thing. That's why I want to work. || I want to keep working, I want to keep doing my humanitarian stuff around the world, shining light on different places that have problems. Keep making movies, make people laugh. || I think real life reflects your movies. In your life, you pick stuff that influences what movie roles you wanna pick. I think if you've got an interesting life, you wanna do interesting movies about interesting things. || I love traveling. It not only opens my mind up, but it also allows me to use my fame in another way through humanitarian works and stuff, and being an influence around the world. || I feel like every time I go out, I want to do a good job. I want people to say that he's just as good at stand-up as he is in some of the movies I've seen him in, so I try to do the best every time I go out there. || Georgia was a great place to live, but I wanted to get out because I knew the opportunities for what I was doing - stand-up comedy and eventually acting - were in Los Angeles. || Comedy comes from a place of hurt. Charlie Chaplin was starving and broke in London, and that's where he got his character 'the tramp' from. It's a bad situation that he transformed into comedic one. || When you're first starting out, you want to keep making good movies. When you're young and you're black, you do a bad movie and you're through. || This country is just that great that the opportunities are there for a Hispanic president, a black president or any other race for a president, yes. || I will always do stand-up, even if my acting career takes off. Stand-up is my life. || I want to do movies that mean something, that make people laugh and cry great movies, period-piece movies and work with the best people out there, who bring the best out of me. || We just got vialated by a nasty, small Frenchman. || They call you 'Pops',you work in the library and your best friend's a mouse. || I started out in this industry with standup comedy and it got me to the movies, but it’s something I love to do and it’s something I’m enjoying coming back to. || I've been fortunate to work with good directors who understand improvisation and understand the way comedians work. Luke Basan let me do my thing like do what you feel and take the character to another level. Quentin Tarrantino was more of an acting coach. He can teach you beats and then hell say go with it but give this feeling. So I've been fortunate to work with good, seasoned directors. || I am now half Asian. I have learned all the ancient teachings of Buddi. || Wow! Lee, we got a big ass problem. || Everybody goes through a lot of the same things, and I talk about those, and that's the key. You have to connect with your audience, and I might take them on a trip with me, tell them I went here and I went there and they'll go with me, you know, to hear the stories. || My mom raised me to never have anything control me. || A lot of directors, they're creative, but they're different. || I've actually tried to give Brett Ratner dance lessons, but he thinks he already knows how to. || Being a big star and being known, making movies and a lot of money - that really doesn't interest me. || I think all the knowledge and all the travels that I've done, I'm going to do a lot of great work in the future. || I do a lot of traveling around the world. || Day-to-day life is a lot of work. I work a lot on stand-up stuff, and then day-to-day life and, you know, just living. It's always different. Try to work out, try to stay in shape, and try to have some fun. || I've got a big closet of scripts, and a big stack of scripts on the side of my desk, because you get a whole bunch. Nothing's going to be perfect, and I realize that; but I am a perfectionist, so you go through a lot of stuff. || I don't know what your feedin' him, but he is too damn big! || I tell people that stand-up's like golf: you gotta do it every day to get it down - or at least three times a week to get it down. || So I kept it to myself. Then some of my classmates started to come down to the comedy club, taking a girl out, and they started finding out I was a stand-up comedian. || It’s funny because when I was younger my voice would rise when I would talk on the microphone. Now it is sort of like a character for me, a more animated version of myself and my voice is 10 times up from my regular self. || Weed is from tha earth. God put this here for me and you. Take advantage man, take advantage! || It's crazy because people expect you to be funny all the time and every day is not a funny day. I go to funerals and people are like 'tell a joke' and 'say one of your lines in a movie.' It's a funeral, man! || We're certainly going to fight for a reasonable amount of money. || Guns don’t kill people. Stupid motherfuckers with guns kill people. || A nigga so broke these days somebody rob me they just be practicing. || Puff puff, give. Puff puff, give. You're fuckin' up tha rotation. || I'ma whip your ass! You, me, him! Everybody's ass around here!"
Christian Finnegan,"Relationships are like yard sales. They look good from a couple yards away, until you realize it's a bunch of shit you don't need. || I used to play bass for a while and got to the point where I was good enough to be in a shitty band. || If I could go back and talk to the ""me"" who was just starting to do comedy, I would have told myself to relax and not worry about things happening right away. That’s a mistake a lot of people make - they think a year is a long time and it’s really not. || What people really want is not to make something funny, but to make something amusing - which, in many ways, is the opposite of funny. To amuse someone is to eliminate discomfort and awkwardness, kind of like a massage for the brain, while to be funny is to point out awkwardness and discomfort. Everyone thinks they want funny, but they really want amusement. || Basically, I got into stand-up because I’m too egocentric to be an actor and not disciplined enough to be a writer. || I certainly do believe that a lot of comedy comes from awkwardness and embarrassment - pointing out the ways things are uncomfortable. Definitely the stuff that interests me. I don’t necessarily think that comedy comes from a dark place, like you have to be a strung-out heroin addict. But I don’t think it comes from happiness, that’s for sure. It comes from frustration and suppressed rage, and wishing the world were different. || Jeez, you'd think the people in this bank had never seen someone playing castanets before. || The thing is - I'm not an idiot. I'm rather intelligent, as proven by the fact that I just used the word 'rather' in a sentence. || Do me a favor, guys. Don't drink so much that you become the guy that goes into the bathroom and moans while taking a leak. See, the women in the room, they might not know what we're talking about; every dude knows. || Do you guys remember that woman who disappeared a few years ago, Chandra Levy? Do you remember her? I found this fascinating. Apparently, the day she disappeared, she had gone on her computer, and the last website she ever visited was an online map of the park where her body was found. That's true. I just hope that if I ever disappear, people don't look for me based on the last websites I visited. || You were born on April Fool’s Day because you’re a dick. || I knew the minute I met my wife, I looked at her and said, 'Oh my God, that is the woman I'm going to spend the next four to seven years with.' || I'm working on something a little different. It's a technique I call, 'tantric abstinence.' Now, the way this works is I meet a woman, I charm the heck out of her, and then right as she's considering sleeping with me, I say something so awkward that she leaves and I have to start over again with another woman entirely. || Some of you guys must have real jobs - office jobs. Anybody? By a show of broken spirits. || I haven't had a drink in twelve days and I've gotta say, I'm pretty shocked at how boring people are. || Did you ever notice how short the interval is between ""I can't wait for summer"" and ""Fuck this shit""? || If think the pig was terrified because he was fully aware that after segment he was going to be fed to Al Roker. || If you refuse to see Superman Returns this summer, what you're saying about yourself is: I heart Al Qaeda. || Basically Britney Spears' video is like a three an a half minute version of Glitter. || I think it's really funny watching all the people that have been booted off The Apprentice trying to pretend as if they respect the two guys that are still there. They obviously think these two guys are jackasses. || Nothing will rob you of what little testosterone you do have like crawling into a bed with a chihuahua. As a guy you could be wearing a Hello Kitty backpack, carrying dandelions and licking a penis-shaped lollipop and that, my friends, would be one third as gay as waking up in the morning to find you and a chihuahua are spooning. || I think I speak for America when I say, ""nothing says NASCAR like Whoopi Goldberg."" || After nearly killing herself, Kristy Yamaoka has been whipping through the talk show circuit at a break-neck pace. || People might say, ""What's so great about the Arctic Monkeys? I've never even seen them."" Well, you've never seen God either. You're gonna tell me he's not awesome? || This documentary is so sexy, it puts the sex back in quantum phy-sex. || Canada, or as i call them, America Light. || The Smurf village was destroyed weeks ago and Bush has still not made an appearance. George Bush doesn't care about tiny blue people. || I hope that if I ever disappear, people don't look for me based on the last websites I visited. Kind of an awkward press conference for my parents. ""Officer, do you have any leads?"" ""Well, based on Mr. Finnegan's computer entries, we think he was abducted by Sorority Sluts."" || Pimp stands for Positive Intellectual Motivated Person. It has nothing to do with selling sex for money. || Michael Jackson's charity efforts? Mmm. I'm sure they have nothing to do with his molestation charges. || If you purchased the latest Joss Stone CD, what you're saying is that you're an employee of VH1. || What is the point of a car alarm if it doesn't get people out of their beds to come help you? So if I ever have a car alarm - if I ever have a car - it's just going to be a big speaker on the back of my car. And when anybody tries to break in, it's just gonna go: ""Attention! Free bags of weed! Come get your free bags of weed!"" || The thing is, I hate political comedy. I personally loathe it. || As a general rule, I’ll talk about anything, provided it’s funny. But some topics - disease, famine, Big Daddy Kane - have a slightly higher threshold for how funny an idea must seem for me to try it onstage. || I joined a gym recently. I don't have the best history in the world of sticking with my fitness regimens, but I feel like this time's gonna be different. I figure one of two things is gonna happen: either I'll get into shape, or I'll just resign myself to paying an $85 a month fat tax. || You know what I'm great at? Trivial Pursuit. What good is that gonna do you in life? It has the word 'trivial' in the name. The game is basically telling you that you pursue trivial things. Trivial - as in not important. Trivial - as in maybe you should've gone to grad school. || I love dogs because there's no filter mechanism between the dog's brain and its tail. There's no filter there. Like, if the dog is happy, the tail is wagging; if the tail is wagging, the dog is happy. There's no passive aggressive shit like humans, like, ""Oh this douchebag thinks I'm happy to see him"". || I'm not an alcoholic. I just drink that way. || Jesus is a powerful guy in Hollywood. Not quite as powerful as Vin Diesel, but powerful. || And what is it they patrol? The Easy Listening section at Sam Goody. You're not going to get to the Josh Groban without going through the Soul Patrol. || If you bought the soundtrack to the motion picture Ray, what you're saying about yourself is, ""I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and pretend I've been a lifelong Ray Charles fan."" || You rarely hear anyone use the word ""pancreas"" in a not-horrible context. || I was told by a physician to avoid any line of work where people need to, um, depend on me for anything. || I really respect peple who try. People who say, ""No, I’m actually going to do the best I can."" That said, you want to do the best you can while remaining who you are. || There are two kinds of intelligence in this world. People who are Monopoly smart and people who are Trivial Pursuit smart... If you’re starting your own business, don’t even talk to me. But If you need to know who the lead singer of Kajagoogoo is, I’m your guy. His name is Limahl, by the way. || There comes a point where the disappointments in your life accrue faster than you can find external forces to blame them on."
Christopher Titus,"Well, honey, she's brain dead. Her brain doesn't work anymore.' 'You mean like Uncle Rudy?' 'No, honey, Uncle Rudy's on Thorazine. And Paxil. And marijuana. And merlot.' || At the millennium we partied like it was 1999. And then we had a 10 year bathtub tequila hangover, man. Just hugging the metaphorical toilet on a daily basis. || Let's define ""terrorist organization."" A terrorist organization is an organization that makes you feel scared all the time and makes you change your behavior. What does CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC do all the time? That's right. Wolf Blitzer? Terrorist. Glenn Beck? Terrorist. Nancy Grace? Terrorist. And her plastic surgeon. The only news organization that is not a terrorist organization is the BBC. Because the BBC can make the worst things sound okay. ""Hello, welcome to the BBC. Satan has re-entered the planet. He is picking up babies with his talons, ripping off their heads, and sucking out their souls. We're in for a thousand years of darkness, all hope is lost and now, the World Cup update."" || My parents' divorce settlement involved a bar tab. || She had just ended an abusive relationship and I had just ended an abusive relationship and now both of us just wanted a relationship where we could make somebody else fucking pay! || Girls mature faster than boys. Yeah, a chick came up with that. || Screwed-up people settle fights through violence. This can escalate into a war that can kill millions. Normal people settle disputes over cookies, cakes, and pies. Normal people are fat. || Everybody has hope for the perfect love. Normal people are raised to believe that there's someone out there who's your soulmate, your best friend, your lover. My dad always told me that when you find that person, ""You gotta nail her""! || Death, is good. If it's someone you don't like. Oh, c'mon! Vlad the impaler, I mean Hitler's dead, woohoo! No matter heinous someone is, remember, there's always a chance that deputy from Barstow will find their body in the desert rolled up in charred carpet. || There's a one in six billion chance you'll find your soul mate. And that's if they're not dead. At best they're probably living in some Siberian ice cave eating bugs and weaving beads into their back hair. But they're out there. My dad believed that to find your perfect soul mate, first, you had to look through a bunch of other guys' soul mates. || Normal people, fear the day their parents die. Screwed up people, fear the day their parents kill. My mum killed a guy, at my wedding. So I can pretty much check that off. But, she's my mum. And no matter what she did I just can't walk away from her. She gave me birth. She gave me love. She gave me the ability to make a cigarette fire look like it was started by the hot water heater. || Lady, if you laugh and you don't make a noise, you're a shaker, and it's freaking me out. || Osama's dead. Why is the terror alert ""elevated"" or ""imminent""? Why not ""chill""? Can't I just fly, keep my shoes on and avoid X-ray-fueled testicular cancer? || Martha Stewart's a convicted felon and they gave her another television show. What's next, the Scott Peterson Fishing Hour? || I learned early on that passion, stupidity and 80 ounces of cheap beer will win the heart of any woman. And if it doesn't, you'll be too hammered to remember. || My dad's third heart attack, he'd gotten so good at them, he decided to drive himself to the hospital because 'They won't let me smoke in the ambulance!' and 'You can't make a burger run.' || Anyone can have a relationship but if you’re dating a woman who’s so crazy in bed that if you aren’t wearing your Kevlar one night you might never see daylight again... that’s exciting. || I have been accused of sleeping with people, I hadn’t met yet. || I didn’t realize I had any problems until you fucking brought it up. || She was moving to Los Angeles, so I thought, ‘Hey, you know? I’ll go with her.’ So when we get out to LA... The relationship, you know, once the geography changed, my God... It was a fucking nightmare! || We’re looking for answers in a landfill instead of looking to people who bring the light. || Mad Cow Disease? I gotta be afraid of fucking cows now? And Canadian cows, I feel like such a puss. || By the way, could you get that look off your face? 'Cause I'm going a lot further then I'm already at right now. Y'know, you can stand on the curb and get on the bus, but I'm fucking driving. || Ladies, if you’re at the mall and you think your man is looking at other girls just remember: If your man is at the mall with you... he... loves you. || I’m whitie and I apologize. || To every race of people in here tonight that whitey has jacked up, I sincerely apologize - for taking your land, for the abuse, for the torture, for the small pox blanket, for the Jim Crow laws. Black people, I apologize for Kramer. || When you are a screwed up person, you have a responsibility to keep your normal friends from being walked on. You have to ride shotgun in their lives and protect them, because normal people, oh ho, easily manipulated. Oh, look over there, now look back. Oh, you so need me. || France participates. Does anyone want to be France? || When I was seven, I watched ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" with my mom. When Jack Nicholson was strapped to the table getting electroshock treatment, my mom burst into tears. She said it reminded her of her life, and I was stunned, because I didn't know my mom had been nominated for an Oscar. || We don’t have home movies in my family. We have people’s exhibit A. || Why should I learn English? I'm never going to England. Shah, pffff, ur, doy. || There's one in every family. When the police calls in the middle of the night and says ""We've got a family members of yours under arrest"" and you know directly who it is. In my family we have seven of those... And they are all my Mom! || If you ask my dad for help... he'll help. Like a vulture helps an over-run armadillo on a Texas highway. One peck at the time. || Sometimes, to help the people you love, you've gotta commit a felony. || I swore I would never get involved in my dad's life. But then he started blowing it. So I had to get involved, you know, but he's my dad, I can't send him to his room or ground him or go to his first grade play and scream, ""Look at the fairy!"" I was a wood nymph. || Fighting Dad's not a fight. Fighting dad is, ""Hi, you've just instigated your own mugging! Come on down!"" || Mad cow disease, monkey pox, bird flu, mosquito viruses - did the animal kingdom have a meeting? ""Who here is tired of being food and clothing? ... Cows, get on it... Moo!"" || This is a man who survived four heart attacks. Yeah, the doctor revoked his organ donor card. Issued him a ""Hazardous Waste"" decal. Well, he actually had three heart attacks and a heart ""episode."" Cause his last heart attack, he was with an HMO. Yes. And it seems that if they write down ""heart attack,"" they have to admit you. But if they write down ""heart episode,"" they can give you Robitussin and send your ass home. || If I am ever brain dead, kill Titus. If I cannot control the fluids spewing out of my own orifices, please kill Titus. If I'm not aware enough to pick which diapers I would like to be changed into, for God's sake, kill Titus - unless I'm really funny. || Everybody's a racist. It's the one human trait that makes us all exactly the same. Deep down, we only like people who are exactly like us. And it doesn't matter. White. Black. Red. Yellow. Purple, uh oh, the purple people, are the worst. Man. All prejudiced and birth marky. But, we've got to learn to get past our differences. I learned that at the museum of tolerance. After my dad beat the crap out of a guy over a parking spot. || My mom had this inate ability. Whatever town my mother moved to, the second she walked into town, she would instantly attract the alpha loser of that town. This guy was not a good guy. This guy was half O.J. Simpson and half O.J. Simpson. Scott Peterson sprinkles on the top, a side of Robert Blake. You know, not a good guy. || I want to be cremated. Then I want to you to take the ashes, I want you to put them in a douche bottle, find a hooker, and run me through one more time. On my children, I did not write that. I am repeating it. || The Times Square Incident wasn't a terrorist attack, it was a Jim Carrey movie. The terrorist locked the keys to the safe house he was going to escape to in the carbomb. And I love that he locked the carbomb. ""Nobody's getting my Ipod."" Then he left the keys to carbomb hanging out of the tailgate of the carbomb, and built the carbomb out of fertilizer that wouldn't explode. I have been doing comedy for 25 years and I have never been that funny. || Valentines Day is a day we celebrate real love. A love so strong that two hearts become one. Yeah, when you're happy, she's happy. And when you're angry, she's angry. And when you start wallowing in self-pity because your hotrod shop tanks and everybody's against you so you start drinking. And then she moves out and goes and lives with her parents, pfft. Or was that the day after Valentines Day? Doesn't matter. I'll go get another one just like her. || So what if your custom car shop tanks and you've gotta take a crappy job at an auto parts store, dealing with ignorant, pushy people. I'm okay with that, 'cause I'm an ""ignorant, pushy people"" person. || Humans are born, small, weak and helpless. That's why we have family. And the elders of the family are the honoured guardians of our country's history. Unfortunately, in America, we, you know, lock those elders away out of view in nursing homes and go about our little lives. It's a great national shame and an irredeemable tragedy. Oh well. || If you want something bad enough, you've got to make a bold move. Just make sure you clear the bold move with the people whose lives it's going to affect. Like George Washington, had to get all those guys who the British killed to agree to die. Neil Armstrong, had to crank a couple of elbows into Buzz Aldrin's face mask to make sure he got on the moon first. And Christopher Titus, well, he worked his dad for five grand. Ha ha. Who can't support who ? I know, it's complicated. || When you are a screwed up person, you have a responsibility to keep your normal friends from getting walked on. 'Cos, how bad could you screw that up ? And don't say, ""Well, you could cause someone six months of physical therapy."" 'Cos, hey, lots of times, those exercise take places in pools and nylon tents with little plastic balls. Fun places like that. And, she gets to park up really close for a while. Ha ha, oh, I'm the bad guy. || How far would you go for someone you love ? I heard this story, about this woman, who actually lifted a car off of her baby. 'Course I would have said, ""Dude! Back up."" But, wasn't my kid. When I was born, if I'd have known all the stuff my dad was going to do for me, I'd have crawled right back in. || How far would you go for someone you love ? Well, when my grandkids ask me how I pledged my love to their grandma, I'll say, I told her I would die for her, after I found out I didn't have an incurable disease. Then, I ran away while grandma was getting her ass kicked by a pregnant woman that grandpa slept with. You never know when you're making a memory. || What? No, dude, I did not try to bring down that plane. If I had tried to bring down that plane, that plane would have come down!  || My mum was crazy. And her mum was crazy. And her mum's mum was crazy. Is it my turn? Am I going to live the rest of my life giggling at raindrops, wearing paper slippers? When I go to dinner with friends should I not use a fork 'cause I just might snap? Hey, you guys look great. How's the baby? || Life, is easy. And if someone is ripping your ass, maybe they're just trying to push you. To the peak of your ability. Until, one day, you reach a level that even you didn't think you were capable of. Stick around those people. 'cos, sometimes, when you think someone's screwing you, they're helping you. And then sometimes, they're just screwing you. Little bastard. || In a crisis, my family puts aside all its petty differences and hatreds... Because a crisis, is a perfect opportunity to create new petty differences and hatreds! My dad's from that era when you lived to 50, your heart exploded and that was that. You know when you cook bacon and you pour the grease into the can? My dad's the can! || Fathers and sons are natural enemies. Look at any species. Shark, sees his father in the water, he's not thinking, ""Hey dad, wassup ?"" He's thinking, ""Back off, old man, this surfer carcass is mine."" Of course, when his girlfriend swims up and she's like, ""Way, you know, there's enough surfer for everybody. You and your dad need to frenzy together more. Leave you father a thigh."" || My dad's all I've ever had. When I was 3 and 4, my mom used to take me to bars. I understand why now - babysitters cost beer, beer and-a-half an hour. || Everyone should think for themselves. I learned that in a book I bought called 'Everyone Should Think For Themselves'. || Does anyone ever shudder with the crap that you pulled off and didn't die? || Without her I don't exist. Without her, I wouldn't be doing this for a living. Without her, in four states it would still be legal to kill a man with a cappuccino machine. She touched a lot of lives. || And me having kids, with my family history? My mom: mentally ill, shot and killed her last husband. My father: six ex-wives, four heart attacks. Both of my parents think alcohol is a food group. || Osama Bin Laden is dead? Oh my God, that was so easy! And it only took two trillion dollars, two wars and too many good men. || I had a real job at fourteen years old. At seventeen, I was on my own. At twenty, I cut the liver out of a drifter and gave it to my father! 'Cause my dad's a drinker and I love my dad. And for eighty bucks, you can do anything in Mexico! || If you're already so low on the parental totem pole, skill-wise, that you're letting your child scream ""frickin'"" in a public place... just let 'em say ""fuck."" He's already going to prison. Don't make him a bottom-bunk, too. || I have to warn you about tonight's show. Tonight's show will fix your relationship or destroy it. And either way, you're welcome. || I asked him one time to tell me how I was conceived. You know why? 'Cause I wanted one good story. I don't have any good stories. I have no romantic stories of my parents that don't end with this phrase: ""So the cops finally cuffed the crazy bitch."" || Dad finally had a defribillator implanted in his body. You know, ""Clear!"" He had a little one right here. Ironically, the size and shape of a cigarette pack, which used to crack me the fuck up, man. 'Cause he smoked for forty years, and now he's got a permanent little square right here. ""Hey dad, you got a cigarette?"" ""Yeah, hold up."" || First grade show-and-tell, I taught the class to mix Long Island Iced Teas. From scratch. || So I went to drown my sorrows in a 19 year old waitress. So we talked, and on the third day, I got her into bed. And she started to cry. It’s like I’m a mental-illness magnet at this point. || Step up or step aside. || We thought O.J. was a fluke. Turns out O.J. was a trend setter! Since then, O.J., Peterson, Robert Blake, who got off on the ""I couldn't have shot her, I left my gun the restaurant"" defense. || Thanksgiving is a holiday that brought together two different cultures. And things might not always work out like you think they should. But they always work out. I'm thankful that the world's in perfect harmony at all times. Pilgrims had it tough. But now, we live in the strongest, most prosperous country in the world. And the Indians, well, you know. || In a normal family, surprise means presents, cake and a party. My family, surprise means homelessness, abandonment and destruction of private property. Sometimes we have cake. We're not losers. || Valentines Day is the day we celebrate real love. A love so strong that two hearts become one. And when she's happy, you're happy. And when she's angry, you can still choose to be happy, 'cos, what's her deal ? You know, I'm happy. Why is she bringing me down, you know ? Oh great, now look, I'm getting all mad. I hope she's happy. Happy Valentines Day. || My dad got divorced six times. Well, he actually only got divorced five times. He wouldn't divorce the sixth one 'cause he said he didn't want people to think he couldn't commit. ""I don't want people not taking me serious."" Dad, your last marriage was performed in Reno by an ordained lesbian Elvis impersonator. Who you hit on. || I believe life is about balance. My mom was brilliant, yet manipulative. Beautiful, but had more voices in her head than the Wu-Tang Clan. Loves her kids, killed her last husband. I say ""last husband"" because you don't get another one after that. || Of course, here's the weird part. After I fought my dad, all of a sudden we're buddies now. Like he's my friend now, we start hanging out. But we're still the same people. So we'd go out on Sunday, you know, and just be hanging out, then he'd, like, pick a guy, and we'd just go beat the crap out of that guy as a team. Memories, huh? || My dad's full of encouragement and support. It just feels like abandonment and neglect. || A salamander can grow a new tail in three weeks. My dad can score new tail in three minutes. || Dad is a new person. A person who has learned that forgiveness is better then revenge. Next year, we'll teach him that heart attacks are not like women. You just can't keep having them! || My dad don't like lies. He says it hurts people in the long race. He prefers the truth. That hurts them instantly. || My father thrives on fear. You know that prayer ""If I should die before I wake""? I had sheets that said that! || Thanksgiving is a holiday that brought together two different cultures. The pilgrims came here with the best intentions. They decided to flee an oppressive people and move to a new land. Where they thrived. And became an oppressive people. You get certain people on the same continent, there's going to be a problem. Pilgrims and Indians. Protestants, Catholics. My family, anybody else's family. || Your father. He loves you. But, he doesn't like you. And why should he ? Huh ? Ever since you were born, he's had less money, less sex, less time, less stuff. You eat his food. You wear his clothes. You don't give him his messages. And look, you're his son. You suck. || Your father loves you. But, he doesn't like you. His job is to tell you you suck and are worthless so that when you get out there on your own you don't end up sucking worthlessly. He makes you a better man so that one day you will have the strength and character to stand up to him. And give him the finger. But just pray on that day he doesn't have the strength and character to break that finger off. Ow. I thought he was sleeping. || We've lost our way, I thin. We keep waiting for a wizard to fix it. You know, the Democrats and Republicans - they're not going to fix it. That's just Coke and Pepsi - same crap, different can. || I find that Americans are all in the middle somewhere, except for the extreme nuts, and extreme nuts on both sides are the loudest. And that's why it feels like we are polarized. || We kinda hated sitcoms when we sat down and talked about this. We wanted to do something that was in the sitcom vain but totally different. || I’m the sort of loser who succeeds really well and then drops a turd in the punch bowl. || I'm thinking of a presidential bid; currently indexing and cross-referencing everyone I've tweeted my junk to. 8x10s available. || The United States ranks 14th in the world in education. Even if we subtract Sarah Palin's test scores, it only bumps us to third. Damn you, Finland! || I can't stop some idiot from crashing into a building or blowing up a bus, I can only be your dad and give you a few pure truths. Number one, duct tape will save your life. Number two, Tupac is alive, but I need you to keep that on the DL because of Suge. And number three, don't be afraid of anything - except the television news because they're lying to you every night. || At the end of the Peterson trial, my daughter turns to me and she goes, 'Daddy, are you going to kill Mommy?' 'Oh, honey - that's up to mommy, isn't it?' || I don't tell people I'm white anymore - I'm albino-Cambodian. || I know pushing out babies is hard. But on September 11, I panicked and tried to push one back. || Can anyone lead us? Someone with integrity, truth, fire? Someone to create peace and unite us? God, I just described Bono and SpongeBob. We're fucked. || Oh yeah, I’m mentally screwed up for life. But I look good. || My father was on the Alcoholics Anonymous wishlist. My mother was on... parole. And lithium. || I finally stopped drinking when I hit seventeen years old. Yes, imagine the fuckup I must have been. Stopped drinking because it isn't really good for your health... and I fell into a bonfire! Yeah, you're done drinking then. You don't need AA. Falling into a bonfire is a one-step program. || My father never missed a drink in his life. Or a joint. Or a party. Or a chance to get laid. He also never missed a day of work, or a house payment, or a car payment. I never went hungry, although he did a couple of times so I wouldn't. This is a man who survived four heart attacks. The doctors revoked his organ donor card and issued him a ""Hazardous Waste"" decal. || She had a little quirk! A little glitch. We’d get into an argument, I would present my side of the argument. Her retort would invariably be to... punch me in the face. || The only thing that ever made me want to be a wife-beater is being called one. ""Your honor, can I have five minutes to make her not a liar, please?"" || Divorce is just about change, you know. It's God saying, ""You need a change. And I'm going to make it so your bank account only has change."" || Good evening, black people. First of all, may I say you're right. You do dance better than us. But on the other hand, I, also, love chicken. || My mom was a manic depressive schizophrenic who, after a year in prison, went home and shot herself. My sister, Kirsten, an amazing poet, who was raised by this woman, and was dating a guy who broke up with her for the fourth time in three weeks. And one day, she came to his house, got a gun, and blew her brains out all over his headboard. I just went through a divorce, five years in court and cost me $2 million dollars. If anyone, by law, should be forced to take antidepressants it's me... But instead, I choose to be an antidepressant. And you can take me with alcohol. || When you're born, you're pure. Unspoiled and trusting. Some say, it's the only time we're perfect. You're also born covered in blood and placenta. No one gets nostalgic about that. || Thomas Jefferson said, ""The tree of liberty must be fertilized from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."" Yeah and I heard that and thought, ""I'm out!"" || My dad also survived five divorces, and the women he married cleaned his ass out every time. I used to think my dad got divorced because he wanted new furniture. At one point in my life, all we had left was a wooden box, a 12"" black-and-white TV, and a four-man rubber raft for a couch. And yet, I was the coolest kid in third grade. ""Mom, can we have a sleepover in Christopher Titus' house? They have a raft in the living room! We can row to breakfast in the morning. I can actually be Captain Crunch!"" || The towers fell, and the first thing that went through my head was my dad's voice: 'Well, you brought a new life into the world, and the world's over. Nice timing, numbnuts!' || Anyone look back at their high school career and just shudder at what you got away with and didn't die? || I have a hot wife, I know that, because every guy that meets her, when she leaves the room, turns to me and goes ""Dude, man, if you die... I'm gonna be all over that!"" ""Thanks, dad."" || Being a parent is a life sentence. From the day that kid is born until the day you die. And then some. Mum, there is nothing to forgive. You gave me life. And, hey, you're not crazy anymore. Everybody thinks I am. Real funny, mum. || Blood doesn't make you family. Hell, an only child can bleed. It's the sharing of pain that makes you family. 'Cause, you can't really love a brother or sister until you know that they're as scarred and broken as you are. And, hey, if you grow up with a father like mine and you aren't at least a little scarred and broken, well then, that's not your father. You were spawned by an entirely different guy. || Dad thinks vengeance is the coolest thing about the Lord. That, and turning water into alcohol. || Vengeance, is good. It's what separates us from the animals and the daisies. But, you need something really bad to take vengeance for. Like, your girl friend hogs the chocolate milk. No. But, your girl friend drags you into therapy and lets your family secretly watch while you weep, well, I think even the daisies want to kick a little girl friend ass. And, the worst part about it, is that she apologised. Gave me a back rub and we had the best sex we ever had. What kind of manipulative crap is that? || Vengeance, is good. You give it, you get it. It's all part of what makes us human. So thank god for vengeance. Otherwise, the human race might as well just roll over and let another species for a while. I think it will be the cats. Watch 'em. They're cooking up something. || I don't fail. I succeed at finding what doesn't work. || Don't puss out on me now! || My first car was a 1977 Oldsmobile Delta 88. Ugly car. More ugly on this car than a Rolling Stones group photo. || In 1998, in Laramie, Wyoming, two guys beat up Matthew Shepard and left him on the side of the road hanging on the fence to die. They killed him, because Matthew Shepard was gay. They killed him, because Matthew Shepard was gay? They killed him. || Normal people, fear the day their parents die. Screwed up people, fear that their parents are going to live forever. Showing up at your house at weird hours of the night, smelling all funny, with a bunch of their friends. ""Hey boy, this is Harold, Cecil and Dicky. Dicky lost his wife about a year ago. I hear Erin made cookies. Where can I put my shoes ?"" If that doesn't scare you, you're not human. || Normal people, who grow up with compassion, never amount to anything. They're the ones who end up gluing those little dots on the highway. Or, putting glue on the dots for the guy who glues dots on the highway. Screwed up people, who weren't coddled or raised with compassion, we get stuff done. Sure, we feel a little alone and abandoned, but, we're... very... happy. Why can't you love me, daddy? || All of Dad's relationships ended exactly the same: subpoena, beep of a moving van backing up the driveway, pile of his clothes burning on the front lawn. || God bless America. But God, please help Canada. || I do not need help destroying my relationship. I was raised by my father. I've completed a thirty-year seminar on the power of destroying relationships. || I'm glad I was raised by my dad for other reasons, too. There are things you can learn from a father, as a son, that you can never learn from Mom. Special things, important things. Like ""never challenge Dad to a fist fight."" || I have a dream! Because I have lived a nightmare. || You don’t give out trophies for losing. Trophies for sucking. That’s a communist idea. You don’t get a trophy for losing. You get a piece of pizza and you shut up. Trophies for losing? What the hell happened to us? || Sometimes, to help someone you love, you have to commit a felony. But, you don't want to go to prison for that. ""Hey, dude, what are you in for? Armed robbery? Murder?"" And then, you have to say, ""Love."" And, that's definitely going to get you, you know, picked last for prison kick ball. || Nobody's really happy. And as soon as society realises that you can't trust anyone and that hardship is a natural part of existence, the sooner the therapists will realise that they are worthless! Sorry. They have worth deficit disorder! || My father, never chooses me for anything. If you needed a kidney and I offered him mine, well, pfft. Well, he'd take it 'cos he was dying. It's not that he doesn't love me, 'cos he does. It's just that special kind of love that feels like neglect. || When you're born, you're pure. Unspoiled and trusting. I believed everything and everyone. Then, I met my parents! || People on TV suck. If you ever meet somebody from TV, I want you to punch them right in the face. It'll probably get you on TV. || The truth hurts. It used to sooth, but, then my dad got a hold of it. When I was seventeen, he told me the truth about love. He called our little talk, ""The birds, the bees and your girlfriend's a slut."" || Being a teenager is the worst thirty years of your life. Peer pressure, acne, final exams, seven little tiny hairs on your upper lip. Luckily, the girls never noticed your infantile moustache, 'cos they were hyptonised by the fire engine sized zit on your forehead. || Being a teenager is the worst thirty years of your life. But it all changes after that. You get a great car, a great job. You got a wife, kids, you got your health. But then your company is sold out from under you, your stocks tank, your wife's sleeping with the gardener and your teenage daughter is pregnant. And you notice that you have a prostate so hard, you can actually take a hammer to it. But hey, not one zit. || Losing builds character. So, if you're the loser in your family, don't worry. 'Cos twenty years form now, that perfect can do no wrong brother of yours is going to show up at your house, bald, fat, divorced, with six kids who all hate him and he's going to ask you for money. And because of your character, you're going to look him right in the eyes and you're going to say, ""You know what, I'll give you some money. If you mow my lawn and detail my car. Oh yeah, then you can shampoo the tail."" Loser. || Lady Gaga is proof that David Bowie raped Carol Burnett! || And when did mediocrity become excellence in our country? Music is dead in 2011 because Lady Gaga lives. Really? Is that the best we can do? Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, ""Poker Face""? This stuttering, growling midget with a speech impediment is music? Really? This vapid, pop cancer, Madonna mini-me? She makes Miley Cyrus look like John Lennon. She makes Jack Lemon look like John Lennon. I'm sorry. And you don't get to claim you're not accepted at a billion hits on YouTube. And you're not an artist just cause you can wear a live chimpanzee as a bra. Lady Gaga is proof that David Bowie raped Carol Burnett. || Haiti fell over? Who built Haiti? Two of the three little pigs?! || Hey! D'you guys hear Dr. Atkins died? Slipped on some ice, hit his head, died on life support. The man who invented the all-meat diet... died a vegetable. That's a damn good joke. But that joke's like a Toyota Camry - reliable, not inspiring. || If you want something bad enough, you've got to make a bold move. George Washington, took on the British Empire. Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. Ken Titus taped a hotel key to his underwear to score with an airport security guard. || My random acts of violence weren't random. They were premeditated. || My mum was crazy. And when you're the child of a mentally ill person you spend your entire life waiting for the other shoe to drop. Living in fear that you also might be mentally ill. And the only way to defeat that fear, is to face it head on. Now, the opposite of fear is not courage. It's faith. You got to have faith that you will never end up like your parents. You also got to have faith that you will kick that crazy Korean kids ass in the day room ping pong show down. That's right, Kim Cho. Bring it on, I got something for you. Okay. Okay. One, nothing. Kim is out of his mind, but he is really good. || I’m in jail... and I realize I am blond... I have a tan... I wear white pants... I’m a very pretty man... || We come into this world totally defenseless. A bundle of soft, toothless cartilage that can't roll over, focus, or hold in it's own spit. Then, while you're lying there all helpless some doctor walks in and chops off the end of your penis. Who's a happy baby? Who is? Yes, you are. || Sisters ruin everything. It's in their job description. || Benadryl - the seven-dollar babysitter. || Normal people, want to be accepted. Screwed up people, want to be accepted. It's one of the few things we have in common. My whole life, all I ever wanted was my dad to pat me on the top of the head and go, ""Who's a good boy ? Who's a good boy?"" But, instead, all he ever did was wipe peanut butter on the end of my nose and laugh while I tried to lick it off. || Normal people, want to be accepted. Screwed up people do too. Oh, we made the cover. But any press is good press. Right ? As long as they spell your name right. So now the whole world is gonna read about... Tatus High Performance. Tatus. Great. || Your first leader is your dad. 'course he controls your food and shelter, so, he's not really a leader, he's more of a fascist dictator. But dictators have dreams too. Your dad doesn't. He gave them up when he had you. So remember that next time you say, ""I don't want to cut the lawn."" Just shut up and mow the grass and save the lip for your teachers. || How do we help the church get their respect back? I have a plan: pedophile crucifixions. || There was a guy last week back East who shot his wife at a Domestic Violence Center. I think he misunderstood the sign. || You guys get that, right? Gas is three dollars a gallon, our president is a Texas oil man? Heh, we're fucking retarded. || The eleventh commandment... Uh let me see, you fuck the kid, get the fuck out. And you can put the ""thou shalt..."" wherever you think it goes. || So I think we need a new plan. Next time a country wants to take us on, 'stead of sending bombs, let's try this: send everyone in the country a color television and a satellite dish. And give 'em the basic package, not HBO - screw those people. And before the war starts, we make them all sit down. ""Okay, we'll go to war with you. You want a piece of us, fine, fine. Before we go, I want you guys to understand us a little better, so you have to sit down and watch ESPN2 for 24 hours. 'Cause you watch ESPN2 for a full day, you're gonna understand America a lot better. 'Hi, we're America! We build monster trucks for fun! We developed the top fuel dragster, zero to three hundred thirty miles an hour in under five seconds, cause, pfft, we were bored. Piss us off, heh, and see what we build! And we may feel bad about it later! Ask Japan. But before we feel bad... we're gonna jack you up! And then we're gonna send you food! 'Cause we're America; we're schizophrenic. Don't mess with a nation that needs medication!'"" || I think our collective psychosis is hilarious. With the world moving as fast as it is, if we weren't dysfunctional, we couldn't function. || Consider Palin for President? The most powerful job on earth? You don't give the dumb cheerleader the Uzi. That's in the Bible. || Obama says he's bringing 10,000 troops home. The Republicans are calling it a ""failed jobs program."" || Satan called - he's changed the sheets, fluffed the pillows and laid out the complimentary chocolate. Hell is ready for John Edwards. || People wonder why our kids are getting fat? Maybe it's 'cause we're sitting on our asses on the couch at home watching other people play cards on television? We can't even play cards ourselves. 'Yeah, I'd cut the deck, but I don't want to reach my target heart rate.' || Look at that! It's a park, and there's a white guy and a black guy and an Asian guy and a Latino guy. And that guy, he's Canadian - don't worry about him, they never affect the world much at all. || I think when you sit alone with your brain too much, your own brain starts to rebel against you. || For me, the greatest hurdle to success has always been failure. || If you take the time to smell the roses, sooner or later, you’ll inhale a bee and die. || Humans are born, weak and helpless. We're cursed with natural predators called parents. That's why the grandma was created. To protect us. Oh sure, she's old and frail. But she can kick your dad's ass. || Get off your ass and do something. All you need is the right inspiration. Anger has fueled me my entire life. It makes me feel good and... I'm okay with that. My fear is that my anger will one day make me so damned successful that I'll actually be happy. And then I'll just stop. || A black widow loves her mate then kills him. A praying mantis loves her mate then eats him. Women love my dad, but he's too big to eat. || Being extraordinary is hard. It takes work, and pain, and a good mom, and a good dad, and a good pair of shoes, and I cant do it. It's not in me. Ordinary is all I got. Cheers. || ""Losing builds character."" You know who said that? A loser! Guy who got his ass stomped every day, basketball, football, baseball, lose, lose, lose and lose. All right, I'm talking about me. || Abortion is an atrocity. Those who practice or praise it are either damn idiots, misguided fools, or treacherous devils. || Diabetes is a sugar imbalance. You are an estrogen molotov cocktail. || I lost 28 pounds in my divorce... because that's what a soul weighs. || I say we spend some money, clean up some junkies and make them all go work for the Red Cross. You ever give blood to the Red Cross? Little paper hatted trainee kid, just sticking you full of holes. ""Golly, jeez, this is way harder than the deep fryer, how does this work?"" You get an ex-junkie in there, bap-bap, he's gonna find a vein. You're in, you're out, you got sugar cookie and you're happy! || I lost 28 pounds in my divorce... because that's what a soul weighs. || And by the way, you’re supposed to have anxiety. Did you know that? It’s a human emotion. It’s been around for a couple of million years. You’re supposed to worry about things. You’re supposed to be concerned that the rent’s not going to get paid, ‘cause that’s how the fucking rent gets paid! || And people get so weird about mental illness, you follow the rules! You don’t up a heart patient on a roller coaster, you don’t put a mental patient on a hunting trip with you! || I have pictures of my daughter, in the hospital, at three seconds, six seconds, nine seconds, and then fifteen seconds, 'cause dumbass couldn't get the camera ready fast enough. Yeah, ha ha ha. She wrote that in the photo album. || Texas is a hell hole, man. Dirt, cactus, lizards, dirt, cactus, the Bush family... || The Los Angeles Times reported that sixty-three percent of American families are now considered dysfunctional. Good. 'Cause that means when Armageddon really happens, thirty-seven percent of this population is going to lose their minds. ""Oh my God, the world is over!"" Us sixty-three percent? We're going to go, ""Hey... there's no one watching the Lexus dealership! We're going to the Apocalypse with leather and a CD changer!"" You guys have been great. Thank you. || There's two approved methods for getting a pedicure for a guy. Number one, you use your own grinder or... You have an eighteen year-old Vietnamese girl rub your feet and call you ""Joe"" and that's it! || Psychiatrist are like mind hookers. Give them 200 dollars and they just screw with your head. || Be normal, and the crowd will accept you. Be deranged, and they will make you their leader. || Here's the thing: If you're so far left you actually believe that somebody owes you a job, citizenship and a heart transplant, you're mentally ill. If you're so far right that you actually believe that somebody who doesn't have a job and is not a citizen deserves to have their heart cut out and sold on eBay, and you get to keep 80 percent of the profit - you're mentally ill. || And if you are a man wearing capri pants...? You need to take your guy card out of your wallet and pass it forward. Then... yeah, then, on the way home I want you to buy a tube of Vagasil, a VW convertible, and have your boyfriend drive you the rest of the way home, 'cause you are dismissed. || Women in general suck at raising kids. That's right, I said it! Who wants some? C'mon! When a woman sees a kid putting a penny in a light socket, what does she do? ""No!"" You smack that little hand. ""Well there!"" When that kid's five, getting smacked in the hand is no big deal anymore. Men see the exact same kid putting a penny in a light socket and go: ""No no wait wait... shh shh shh shh... well go on!"" ""Well, you're not gonna do that again are ya? I know it hurt. Shot your ass about 8 feet, I saw. Get up. Yes your eyebrows will grow back."" || It's been five years, we still can't catch Osama bin Laden, but we've nailed Martha Stewart and Barry Bonds' ass to the wall. The world's worst terrorist is still dragging his dialysis machine through a Pakistani strip mall right now, but the doily broad and the slugger prick won't bother us again. || This horrible decade where all of us men tried to be individual rebels... by wearing the exact same flaming skull on a bedazzled Ed Hardy thermal. I have three of them, I'm not laughing at you I'm laughing with you. || Texas is killing people in the 73rd trimester. || The most powerful person in your life is the one that knows all your secrets and all your lies. || The normal make a living, the deranged make history. || I gave my father a heart attack. It was a practical joke. Come on, you push a guy's face in a cake he's got to clean it off. You hit a guy with a water balloon, he's got to dry off. Guy's in the hospital, you get his testicles shaved, he scratches and bleeds for a week... it's funny... you're not supposed to have a heart attack, it kills the joke. || A lie is a lie... unless your friends and family are in on it. Then it's a ""commonly held belief."" || Everyone's a racist. It's the one thing that makes us all the same. || After all, once you've driven your drunk father to your mom's parole hearing, what else is there? || I want everybody I know to be happy, ‘cause guess what; I have found my ice cream truck. And I feel like an astronaut, ‘cause every day with her is a day in outer space. || Sometimes failure makes your future because you set the past on fire. || We're ready for a real black President - someone like Jay-Z. Obama's fine, just not all black. He's our gateway Negro. || Couldn't we have just sent Saddam a mad cow burger and a Paxil and been done with it in, like, '03? || I say a twenty-two year window 'cause you wanna make sure the kid can handle his alcohol. You know, he's a great kid 'till his 21st birthday, gets drunk, punches Grandma and everyone's like ""Ohhhh! Adam! You were this close! We are gonna miss you!"" || He looked like the type of dad that volunteers to hand out the trophies to the losers in Little League. And when did that start?! You don't get a trophy for losing. You get pizza and you shut the fuck up. || I love being from a screwed up family. We have everything in my family: prescription drug abuse, mental illness, one of my uncles is a Mormon. || They had a big court battle over who got to keep me. Mom won; she made me live with Dad. || By the way, six A.M.? Not a real great time for me; you know, I'm a comic. I get off work at two. Six A.M., I'm a little grumpy. Six A.M., I'm a little P.O.ed. Six A.M., I'm like a vampire with a paper route. || You wanna hear the funniest part of that story? Where my mom, y'know, shoots and kills a man? || In my family, goodness is just badness before its had something to drink. || The only way to tell my Dad something is to write it on a note, and tie it to a brick, and throw it through a window. Of course, now Dad's armed with a brick. || Socrates said, the unexamined life is not worth living. My dad said, ""Booty - mmm mmm."" || If you want to do something dangerous... Don't tell your girlfriend! || It should be a law. Everybody should legally own a gun. In fact, if you're caught outside your house without your gun, you get a ticket. And you get shot in the leg. Just to prove my point. || Fifteen years I have chosen not to drink. Because I'm not good at drinking. I know it. Erin knows it. The fire department that had to put me out knows it. || Why don't you climb down off the cross, take the wood to build a bridge, and get over it! || Many massacres have happened when people yell ""surprise""! Pearl Harbor. The Tet Offensive. My uncle's 50th birthday party. I was there, man! How many more people gotta die? || To be successful in life, there are many hurdles you have to get over. For me, the biggest hurdle to success has always been failure. But, growing up, my Dad was always positive... that I'd never amount to anything. || Bad news has never been broken gently in my family. Because, breaking it gently takes a few extra seconds. And who's got that kinda time? Hey, we maybe failures, but we are very busy. || Life, is easy. And if yours isn't, quit whining. Oh, wait. unless you're just a head amd then, you do have it pretty rough. I don't know how you roll out of bed every morning. || Blood... does not make you family. In fact, blood just links your DNA to the scene of their crime. A real brother is a guy you can pin down and dangle a two ounce loogie that far over his face. So, that at the very last second, you suck it back in. Or you don't. That's what makes family. Phlegm. || Nobody's really happy. We used to be, before the psychologists made everything a syndrome. Or a dis-order. Before then, you weren't obsessive compulsive. You were, clean. You weren't schizophrenic, you were just damned good at impressions. There was no attention deficit disorder. I need a new chair. Are those drapes or a blind. My butt itches. Do we have a TV?  || My father, never chooses me for anything. Unless he needs a human shield. Thirty years and all I am to him is a hunk of meat to block buck shot. Told you dad needed me. Who's the best man now? || All parents suck. There's not a good one out there. Not one. You people watching right now... if you were good parents you would turn this television off, you would grab a book, and you would read to you children. || Love. It's God's greatest gift. He fills our world with it and makes sure we grow up with caring, supportive parents. I'm just kidding. Pain is God's greatest gift. Pain is God's way of saying, ""Hurts, don't it ? Well, go ahead. Say, me dammit again."" || Being a parent is a life sentence. You see, that's why normal people should not have children. Because, if you raise a kid with only love and support, I guarantee that kid will be in rehab by the time he is sixteen. Why ? Because you never introduced him to mister back-of-your-hand. You know why I only broke into a liquor store once ? 'Cos my father introduced me to mister back-of-his-hand. And it's wiley side-kick. Mister foot-in-my-ass. || I don't believe in right or left; I don't believe in Santa or Satan. I believe in things I can touch - like vodka and Oreos. || The day I'm in England performing, English security let a man in a Batman suit climb Buckingham Palace. I felt so much safer... Batman was on the wall of Buckingham Palace for five hours. Wouldn't happen in America - three minutes: dead Batman. || Every weekend, I would get the drunk driving lecture. Of course, Dad drank and drove all the time. I guess it wasn't a lecture; it was helpful tips from the master. || Growing up, road trips with Dad were something I hated. Sitting still for hours, singing that stupid song, ""100 bottles of beer on the wall. 100 bottles of beer..."" Dad, you know, keeping up with the song. || My dad invented road rage. He wasn't the first guy to get mad in the car, but he was first guy to get mad enough to make the paper. || Oh, God! Get me out of this Paris Hilton-Lindsay Lohan-Kim Kardashian, talentless slut decade! || If you've dated a woman over five years and she wants a boob job... she ain't getting it for you. She is putting fresh meat on a new hook, that's all it is. She is trolling for idiot ""B,"" because you have not lived up to her financial expectations. So she's gonna cast those double D's out into the dating pool. || Here's how hot my wife is: on our first date, she started talking about kids. Christopher Titus: And I still married her. || Christmas is a time for joy, love and peace. And frothing hot vengeance that will never cease. So no matter the volume of fussing you fuss or the wide angry streams of cussing you cuss, your fate is sealed when in mussing you muss with the nastiest of nasties, the Kenge. Well, Ken Titus. || There's a one in six billion chance you're gonna find your soul mate. But, maybe, your perfect soul mate is actually three or four half perfect people. How far are you willing to go to actually find that perfect somebody... ies. If you're not willing to make a group of people your soul mate then you'd better plan on being alone. You'll always have television. || My mum is in a mental hospital. There's a fine line between genius and insanity. Winston Churchill, Mozart, John Lennon. These people all had a touch of crazy that fuelled their brilliance. They were not locked up for it like my mum. Pft. Then again, Winston Churchill never tried to kill my dad. || When you screw up, you got to pay the price. Shoot up a supermarket, you go to jail. Ride a motorcycle without a helmet, permanent brain damage and in California you're getting a ticket. Too chatty on a date with my dad, well, he'll push you in front of a cross town bus. Of course, you know, I'm speaking metaphorically. My dad will push you in front of any bus. || Denial is a powerful weapon. My dad taught me mind over matter. No matter how hurt I got, he didn't mind. || My parents got divorced. Early and ugly. My mum was nuts so I lived with my dad. We used to play a father/son games. Pin the blame on me, rock, paper, get me another beer, casino night. || My father? A hard drinking man from the 70's. We actually have no pictures of my dad where he is not holding a beer. Weddings, Funerals, Water Skiing, Parent-Teacher Conference. When I got sick around him as a kid growing up, he'd always warm me up a shot of 100 proof whiskey. Never got sick... that I can remember. || A lot of people tell me this, too: ""Don't worry about it. It's God's will. Y'know, you weren't meant to be together. God's will."" God's will? Really, God got involved in this? Really? Twenty years with somebody, twenty years of my life pretty much gone? All the money I made, the career I chose, pretty much torn to pieces? Two little kids' lives shattered? Really, God? Is that how you work? This brutal, disemboweling nightmare… is you? 'Cause if that's the case, then there is no God. And God said unto me: ""Christopher... I did this so you could meet a 29-year-old, 5'11"" Diesel jeans model who has two college degrees and already paid for her own boob job."" How shall I serve thee, Lord? || The yearbook voted me most likely to be scraped off an onramp by a puking fireman. || How come Mom is crazy and I'm not? Well, it's possible my mom could stand up in front of this many people and talk about all the crap in her life and those people could have sat around and laughed with her, it would've meant nothing and she could have moved on cool. It's also possible she could have taken out the whole front row with a large-caliber weapon. || Then you women created a word: ""Manscape."" And we shaved ourselves bald like nine year-old boys. 'Cause we wanted to sleep with you. || I bet a guy at a bar 50 bucks that I was more dysfunctional than he was. He raped me. So I tipped him. I'm very competitive. || I have a dream. Martin Luther King had a dream so big that millions climbed on board. And one man changed a nation forever. Wow. How do you follow a dream that big? I guess you got to start small. You know, baby steps. I have some gum. Anybody can get gum. You feel better now, don't ya? || If you’re a racist, right now, in 2011... You just look like a retard, man. || Terrorists, oh I’m sorry, Fox News tells us it’s all illegal immagration’s fault but it’s not their fault, it’s ours. || Japan is the perfect example of make plans, and watch God laugh. || Everybody I’ve ever met was destroyed by a member of the opposite sex early on and that damage you took into every relationship after that, everybody. Every woman in here got intimidated by a guy, pushed around too much, now you’re new boyfriend tickles you a little too hard, boom restraining order. Every guy here had a woman sleep with his best friend, now your new girlfriend hugs your cousin a little long, boom car bomb. || Hecklers need to be dealt with. Then walk away and do your shit. || I have a dream. With that one sentence, Martin Luther King touched and empowered an entire nation. You know what else he did? He made everybody else without dreams feel real bad. || Christmas is a time for joy, love and peace. And a giant spike in the suicide rate. My father had all the christmas joy sucked out of him by his cruel, vindictive mother because his drunken partying father sucked all the christmas joy out of her. Fa la la la la, la la la la. || They call it torture when our guys put underwear on a guy's head, stripped him naked, put an egg between his buttcheeks and made him do jumping jacks. You know, if it can't get you into a fraternity at Chico State University, it's not torture. || Jealousy - the Auschwitz of emotions. || Participation trophies are the soul herpes of a generation. || So Thomas Jefferson said ""Every generation needs a new revolution"". Now our grandparents had World War II, fought the Nazis. Our parents had the Civil Rights Revolution. Our generation has... Shamwow and Prozac. That's it, man. We just went through the worst decade since disco and how did we deal with it? We bitched on the Internet, got medical marijuana cards, and played Grand Theft Auto. || After President Obama, President Rodriguez... What’s the worse that can happen? The border problem gets solved and the White House lawn looks better? || Two weeks ago in Los Angeles, at a stop sign, I was asked for a dollar by a homeless 22-year-old Vietnam veteran. I was like, 'Here's a buck. Yeah, I know man, Da Nang was whack.' || Maniac, depressed, and a schizophrenic. My umbilical cord was a crazy straw. || Shot down by a twenty-two year old waitress in breakaway panties! || This country you’re sitting in right now was not built on love, hugs, time-outs and trophies you didn’t earn. This country was built on shame, humiliation and striving to be better. By the way, if you’re in this room right now and you’re successful… you didn’t get there because someone loved you too much or gave you too many hugs or you got a trophy when you lost. You did it because at one point in your life, somebody turned to you and said you’re a loser, and in that second, you decided to bust your ass to make them choke on that sentence... Or, your parents gave you the money. || So it seems that because of every syndrome and disorder we've invented in the past twenty years, the Los Angeles Times reported that 63% of American families are now considered dysfunctional. My God! That means we're the majority. We're normal! It's the people who have the mommy, the daddy, the brother, the sister, the little white picket fence - those people are the freaks, man! || I am a patriot, and I protest speed limits by exceeding them. || In a normal family, a surprise means presents, cake and a party. For me ? I had no idea. And my family, doing something nice is seen as an attack. When I was nine, I 'attacked' my father with a fathers day gift. A visor organiser for his car, because it was useful. And it rhymed. Visor. Organiser. I was nine. || Normal people terrify me, because they haven’t had enough problems in their life to know how to handle problems when they come up. Something little happens and they snap. But being from a disfunctional family means nothing rattles me. Hey once you’ve driven a drunken father to moms’ parole hearing, what else is there? || My mom shot and killed her last husband. Yeah, my dad used to say ""Hey, dodged that bullet. Ha ha."" || Get off your ass and do something. Spread your wings and fly. Or, make your friend fly. And, I don't mean, help your friend fly. I mean, force that chubby little non-aerodynamic bastard to freakin' fly. || The closer you get to death, the more alive you feel. Dylan Thomas wrote, ""Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" My dad always taught me to live like that. Dad wrote a poem too. It goes, ""Dune buggies. Woohoo!"" || You don’t get a rebate at the end of your life for living with an idiot. || Clint Eastwood doesn't moisturize! But Clint Eastwood needs to moisturize! || Love screwed up people, though. I could hang out with screwed up people forever. Screwed up people are great, 'cause screwed up people have been through some stuff. They know what can happen. They know the problems. 'Cause if you've been through a lot of shit in your life, you know every time you see the shit just about the hit the fan... you step to the side of the fan. || And my daughter's too smart. She gets it watching TV. She gets it. She's five. She gets it. I... I have a smart kid; I don't want a smart kid. I'm gonna start feedin' her lead paint chips just to bring her down. || Pope John Paul didn't die - he pre-boarded. || By the way, great way to fight: arms down, face presented. || Everyone has an enemy. It’s why God gave us baseball bats. Well, He gave us trees, but we knew what He meant. || Every neighborhood on the planet has a house like this on the block. We've all driven past it. A bunch of people living there, too old to be kids, but never gonna be adults... You can tell that by the ""AEROSMITH ROCKS"" banner in the living room window... Four sociopathic pitbulls roaming the yard at all times... The brown one has one leg, just flops to the fence every couple of hours... You can tell when the family's doubled their net worth 'cause they parked a new gutted Chevelle in the driveway... The mailman's afraid to bring the mail, so he just gives it to the cops, 'cause hell, they're gonna be there anyway... And if you don't recognize this house in your neighborhood, you live in this house in your neighborhood. || I got divorced from my wife on June 6, 2006. Yeah, 6-6-06, which coincidentally, was when my wife turned into a demon spawned from Satan's anus. But for legal reasons, I have to call her, ""Kate."" || We are burning a telephone pole. I don't know where we got a telephone pole. I do know it's pretty high up there on the Drunk Theft Scale, though. || I know who I am. I am just a very thin layer of charming with some funny sprinkles wrapped around a huge creamy center of raging arrogant a-hole. I got it. || If you are in here tonight and you have never contemplated suicide... you've never truly been in love. If you're in here tonight and you have never contemplated murder... you've never been divorced. || Let’s say a guy walks up wearing the goofiest shoes you’ve ever seen. Crocs maybe."
Colin Quinn,"Everybody's funny in different ways. || Everybody's got a different sense of humor. It's just different styles. || My name has zero value. || The ancient Greeks were the first ones to say an unexamined life is not worth living. They don't tell you of course what we found out, an examined life not that fascinating either. || You know how it is with writing. You just write what you want to write. There's no way to predict what is good or bad. You just do what you think is funny, and either it works or you're finished. It's impossible to predict anything. || Humanity is a crazy contradiction. I accept us for who we are. We're not that great. Every time we take a step forward we go back to the same primitive behavior. We're meant to be this way. It's not our fault, it's just who we are. || I always wanted to write as much as perform. || I get the impression the English kings were witty, for some reason. I feel like all you had was your wit. || I like guy stuff. || I think people tend to feel odd when I do my act. Unless you are an ironic person, it's not a good place for you to be. || People say ""history was written by the winners."" No, it wasn't. It was written by the bullies. || The thing that drives me crazy is when comics say 'I have low self-esteem.' No you don't. You're standing on stage asking people to pay. You don't play an instrument. You want people to pay to hear what's in your mind. You don't have low self-esteem. You might have other problems. || I think everyone should own six guns, even though I don't own any. || Honesty buys you nothing at all in this school. || For the most part, comedians are pretty friendly with each other. They always say they badmouth each other, but most of the time, they're friends. We're the only ones that can really stand our type of humor. || I feel most empires fell when they started to act human, but then look at Russia. They kept a pretty strong hand, and they fell from Afghanistan alone because Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. I guess you just can't sustain it. || I love people, I love studying people more than history. So whatever situation I see, then I look at, what were the people like, more than history itself. || I'm quietly becoming New York's premiere actor. People don't understand. They have me pigeon-holed as a comedian. || Marie Antoinette was funny, I'm sure she was just misinterpreted. You know the 'Let them eat cake' line. She seems like she was kind of funny, like a Chelsea Handler or Kathy Griffin type. || My stand-up act? I combine the fact that the world is a violent place with the fact that each person is responsible for the situation they are in. || People's - most people's job is talking about the future or like money not even in the present tense. It's not even paper. || So instead of talking about theoretical ways of ending the war and violence, I say that we have to get rid of the individual asholes in each office and situation. || The only people who like to live alone more than comics are priests. || You know, the funny thing about Lorne and that show is that, you can go over one million things, but in a business of bean counters, he still likes to laugh at small things and creates a show around it. || Everybody says before reviews come out, 'Oh, reviews don't matter,' just in case they're bad; everyone want to brace themselves. || I think Helen of Troy must have been pretty hot. She got two countries going crazy for 10 years over her. || A weird sort of awareness set in, like, 'Wow. My stand-up isn't just separate from everything else I do anymore.' With Twitter and Face book, everything is universal that everything everybody says gets seen. || I think if you try to tailor your act to anybody, you end up with an act that doesn't work anyway. || I think I identify more with the smart guy, but most people might take umbrage at that. I like to think of myself as a real thinker, but I suppose people might beg to differ. || People say history is boring, and that is true because people are boring. We haven't changed since time began. We're still the same. || Twitter is one of those dangerous toys that if it gets in the hands of the wrong person you'll have the mind of a 12-year-old masquerading as an adult. || When I look back now I realize I was such an obnoxious kid but, you know, I went to schools like you, like a public school in New York so compared to the anarchy that was going on there, they really wouldn't - I wasn't like a bad kid. I saw people come in and punch the teachers. || If it had just been some femme fatale, I think this whole thing could have been settled. You know, if it had just been like a beautiful woman. || We battled well and it was an excellent win. || Well... you know, I would wake up with a terrible hangover in a jail somewhere and worst part was that I would not know why I was there. || You can't make money on Broadway. You make nothing. You maybe make like $1,350 a week after you pay out all the producers. || You can't make everybody laugh. You gotta just do what you think is funny. Just be obstreperous to everybody. || With comedians, you have that understanding that we're trying to get laughs. || Those early days of comedy are when you get addicted to it. || I don't know any comedian who tailors his act to his audience. Maybe people say they do, but I can't even imagine them. || That's the beauty of being a comedian - it's the one job you're allowed to do that. We're lucky. We're really lucky. || I was a class clown. || The mistake that people make in stand-up is thinking they're profound or they're deep when there are so many people who have more worthwhile ways of phrasing things. || I'm always working on stuff. But they never materialize. I'm always working on movies and TV shows. || I'm just another guy who thinks he's smarter than he is, in a long line of them. || I would say most comedians have a very cynical worldview of the way the world can work. It's almost like if you didn't, you couldn't be a comedian. || I've been to Japan, I've been to China, I've been to Africa, I've been to the Middle East, I've been to Europe a little bit. I've never been to South America. || If I had to give up everything else and keep just one aspect of the job, I'd have to keep writing because I love it. Yes, I enjoy performing, too. But I couldn't give up writing material. || It was tumultuous, it was crazy, but I would not trade it for anything. || Stand-up is live, so I'm used to being live for most of my career. It's interesting. || I'm not a big method actor. I'm much more superficial. || I write all the time - I write poetry, I love to write."
Craig Ferguson,"A casino in South Dakota was robbed by a man dressed as a mummy. The police described the suspect as anywhere between 25 and 8,000 years old. || Being the executive producer of a film is not that difficult. It just means that you have some power. There's not a huge amount of skill involved, I don't know how much I'm giving away here. I feel like that guy on Fox, giving away the magicians' tricks. It's not rocket science, being an executive producer of a film. || If you're frightened of leprechauns, the best thing to do is to get yourself a little leprechaun outfit and see how big they are. And then you'll go, 'Well I see. That's like bein' frightened of a hampster.' || Every year law schools churn out thousands of lawyers. We don’t need any more lawyers. We need more lawyers like we need more talk-show hosts. || If you watch cooking shows on cable, they have lots of British people. Because when you think good cooking, you immediately think Britain. || When in doubt about who's to blame, blame the English. || It's the time of year when Canadians mate. || I love the United States. I have applied for citizenship. I want to take the oath of allegiance on TV. || I think holidays create so much pressure because people feel they should be having a good time. But you shouldn't. || Thanks cows. I appreciate your tastiness. || They were singing, Gillette, the best a man can get, with a lot of guys hugging their fathers and sailing and riding bikes. I suddenly felt a long way from the best a man could get and I thought it would be nice to get from there to the best. || For me, comedy should have a certain amount of joy in it. It should be about attacking the powerful - the politicians, the Trumps, the blowhards - going after them. We shouldn't be attacking the vulnerable. || Wikipedia celebrates its 12th birthday today. Of course, I have no idea if it’s true. I read it on Wikipedia. || People sometimes say to me: ""Craig, get out of my garden."" || Ratings experts say the best way to get people to watch during sweeps is to leave the audience with a question that won’t be answered until the next time the show is on. You know, like ""Who shot J.R.?"" I like to think I do this every night - the question is, ""Is this show still on?"" || That's why I believe in a Constitution which separates church from state. I've seen what happens when they get in cahoots. || Whether I or anyone else accepted the concept of alcoholism as a disease didn't matter; what mattered was that when treated as a disease, those who suffered from it were most likely to recover. || That's here on CBS, where the 'C' stands for 'Classy' and the 'BS' speaks for itself. || Fox News announced that they're dropping Glenn Beck's show. Beck was crying his eyes out, and then he found out about the show being canceled. || I don't like my politicians entertaining me and I don't like my entertainers politicianing me. || I'm a vulgar lounge entertainer, I don't need to wear a tie. || Some people take the spelling bee very seriously. These people are called ""parents of children in the spelling bee."" They're trying to make up for their own childhood of crushed dreams and misspelled words. || Saudia Arabia takes in half a trillion dollars every year in oil revenue, and the country has a population smaller than New York state, but when your system of government is an eleventh century monarchy, someone's going to end up poor, and it's not gonna be the guy whose first name is ""King."" || I hated the summer jobs I had when I was a teenager. They were so mundane and repetitious, they deadened my soul. On the bright side, it was good training for this job. || In the 1970s vampires were pretty boring. The scariest vampire was Count Chocula. One bite of Count Chocula and you were cursed with Type 2 diabetes. || I know that's not the right accent, but I can't do the right accent. It's either the wrong accent or another Octomom joke. || He was in awe of the thirst that people had for someone to tell them that everything was going to be all right. He marveled at the gullibility and vulnerability of his fellow humans. No wonder the churches called them sheep. They were woolly-headed pack animals being herded around for the benefit of whoever knew how to control the dogs. || There's a commercial break coming and I'm very excited about it and you know why? Because that's what keeps daddy in suits. || With good parody, you have to be smarter that the people you’re parodying. || From this moment on I'd dedicate my life to rock and roll and take as many drugs as possible. What could possibly go wrong? || People talk to old people like they're children. 'Oh you're very old aren't you?' Yeah, I'm old. I'm not stupid. || Every day I ran to that book like it was a bottle of whiskey and crawled inside because it was a world that I had at least some control over, and slowly, in time, it began to take shape. || Alcohol ruined me financially and morally, broke my heart and the hearts of too many others. Even though it did this to me and it almost killed me and I haven't touched a drop of it in seventeen years, sometimes I wonder if I could get away with drinking some now. I totally subscribe to the notion that alcoholism is a mental illness because thinking like that is clearly insane. || Some critics are saying that Palin won't last on Fox because she's an over-emotional woman who gets the facts wrong. But I disagree. It's working great for Glenn Beck, so she'll be fine. || I think we look back at times past with fondness because we were younger. Life had not yet begun pecking away at our innocence like buzzards on fresh road kill. || I'm reading a book, because I'm brainy. No, it is a book - if you don't know, it is like a blog except bigger. || According to a new study, Hawaii is the happiest place in America to live. And I thought it was just a great place to pretend you were born in. || Here at CBS, spring also means March Madness. I love the name March Madness. I’m glad the PC police haven’t made us change March Madness to ""early spring psychosis."" || Even though it’s warm here in L.A., people still have to wear layers - at least until their plastic surgery heals. || Occasionally, when I lived in London, I would have sex with a girl from an aristocratic family. I always enjoyed doing to them what their ancestors did to my country. || The first day of spring is known as the ""vernal equinox."" The equinox is special. It only happens twice a year, like a good night in ratings for NBC. || There are rumors that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are back together. I just want that adorable little girl to be happy again. Maybe Selena can get something out of it, too. || Three things to think about before you say anything: Does this need to be said? Does this need to be said by me? Does this need to be said by me now? || In honor of Earth Day, tonight’s program will be made up of 100 percent recycled jokes. || Every year there’s a jury at the Cannes Film Festival. Getting on the jury is very competitive in France. Not because the French love cinema, but because they love to judge. || With school out, teens are looking for jobs, things like lifeguards. But L.A. public pools do not have lifeguards. We have life coaches. If they see you struggling in the water, they say, “Are you happy with the decisions you’re making”? Then they give you a pamphlet for a yoga studio. || ""World War Z"" is out today. The big zombie movie. The trailer looks scary. You see hordes of bodies climbing and rolling over each other. It’s like Black Friday at the mall. || Love at first sight is not rare, in fact it is extremely common, it happens to some people a few times a year. The feeling of ""what if"" when meeting the eyes of a stranger can be love unrecognized. || There are plans for a new high-speed train between Los Angeles and San Francisco. It will make the trip time 30 minutes. People in L.A. are like, ""Yes!"" And people in San Francisco are like, ""Yeah, sure, great. We look forward to seeing you."" || These days, young people watch TV on smartphones and computers. Young people with an actual TV set are harder to find than a picture of Anthony Weiner with his clothes on. || It’s Earth Day today. Let me tell you something about polar bears. They’re endangered but you have to be careful because a polar bear is one of the few animals that will stalk a human. If you go to where polar bears live, it might stalk you and when you’re on the plane going home, it might be behind you reading. || My pilot's license. I'm proud of that. || Sometimes, in order to follow one’s heart, one must do the wrong thing. Now, I’m not absolving anyone of their actions; you have to be responsible for your actions, sick or well, you have to be, you just have to be. All of us are accountable. || Here in California, we passed a law against texting while driving. But there’s no law preventing you from writing a letter while driving. || Canada is not the party. Its the apartment above the party. || The Universe is very, very big. It also loves a paradox. For example, it has some extremely strict rules. Rule number one: Nothing lasts forever. Not you or your family or your house or your planet or the sun. It is an absolute rule. Therefore when someone says that their love will never die, it means that their love is not real, for everything that is real dies. Rule number two: Everything lasts forever. || I'm always a bit shy around evil people... || The Afghan government is as corrupt as a prostitute with a law degree. || The new Pope, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, is now Pope Francis the 1st. ""Francis"" was not his first choice for a name. But the Vatican wisely talked him out of ""Pope Boo Boo."" || You know your heavy metal band's going to suck when you've got a clarinet player. || Here’s a tip for all you aspiring young comics: Don’t beat up the customers. It is very difficult to get laughs from an audience when you’ve actually drawn blood from one of their number. It kills the mood. || You know, I think there's a good rule of thumb here: Don't take nutritional advice from other species. || A New York City judge struck down a proposed law to ban sodas larger than 16 ounces. I think Mayor Bloomberg should spend his time trying to improve stuff like education. New York needs a better education system if kids didn’t figure out they could get around the 16-ounce soda ban by simply purchasing two 12-ounce sodas. || I always appreciated my teachers. When I was 16, I gave them the greatest gift I could think of. I dropped out of school. || There are nine Supreme Court members and nine people on a baseball team. Coincidence? Yes. || Today Monopoly added a new game piece: the cat. The new piece was chosen after weeks of online voting. Is that a surprise? Whenever there’s a vote for something on the Internet, the cat always wins. || Valentine’s Day is celebrated a little differently here in L.A. Nobody eats chocolate because of the calories, so people give each other tofu-shaped boxes filled with bean curd. Then they fantasize about what their Pilates instructor would be like if he was straight. || The royal baby has a name now: George Alexander Louis. George is not the king yet. So for now, we just address him as ""Boy George."" || A lot of people in their 30's get nostalgic for their teen years. Then they get jobs in TV, become bitter and jaded and prematurely old. Then they turn their nostalgia into great television. || Change is the nature of God’s mind, and resistance to it is the source of great pain. || The devil is not abroad at night in the form of a cat or a wolf or any other animal. He lives eternally in the hearts of men. || Allowances can always be made for your friends to disagree with you. Disagreement, vehement disagreement, is healthy. Debate is impossible without it. Evil does not question itself. Even the incorruptible are corruptible if they cannot accept the possibility of being mistaken. || I realize that I am not a journalist. So anything I say is not important. || Climate change is a serious problem. We all need to do what we can. Unless that means I’ve got to change stuff. Then I’m not doing it. || I was ambitious and desperate to direct my first film, so I capitulated and blew it. Never again. Never fucking again. || After all this time I found that the novel is in fact punk rock. || Jimmy put in a word and told them that if I made it, I wouldn't be able to live with myself without paying them back. That I'd sooner die than owe anyone money for helping me. Apparently Jimmy knew more about me at that point than I knew about myself. || High school is tough on anyone, an absolute rule of the Universe being that if high school is not a buttockclenchingly awkward, emotionally difficult, and unpleasant time of your life, then the rest of it will be a crushing disappointment. Academic success is desirable, popularity - the only thing that most students really desire - is not. Those who excel socially in high school are truly damned. The homecoming queen does indeed bear the mark of the beast. || People spend thousands of dollars trying to keep their teeth straight. I just hope we can live in a world where we accept gay teeth. || It's like a sort of internet Ren Fair. Its like Dungeons & Dragons but for cool people who have got friends. || Dell Computers announced they're releasing a competitor for the iPad. Now it is, in fact, a great alternative for people who already have an iPad, but are fed up with it working all the time. || That's why Credit card companies are evil. Are they sponsoring the show tonight? They are Evil. || Bush's memoir is 512 pages. To be fair, 200 of those pages are just games and puzzles. || Former president George W. Bush released his new memoir. By the way, 'memoir' is just a fancy word for 'a bunch of stuff that happened to me.' || When you need to borrow money the Mob seems like a better deal I think. 'You don't pay me back I break both yer legs.' Is that all? You won't take my house or wreck my credit rating? Fine where do I sign. Legs? Fine. You don't even have to sign anything. || Sometimes they would just pay me to stay home and not do anything else, which sounds fantastic but doesn't do much for your ego. Its probably a little like getting alimony-the money is nice but has a nasty aftertaste. || Even the incorruptible are corruptible if they cannot accept the possibility of being mistaken. Infallibility is a sin in any man. All laws can be broken and are. Often. || I had lived in fear of the fabled terrifying visions that assail chronic drinkers, but which had not yet attacked me. || I do a public access show with puppets. Puppets called actors, TV and movie stars. || This story is true. Of course, there are many lies therein and most of it did not happen, but it's all true. In that sense it is deeply religious, perhaps even biblical. || The world can be such a fright, but it belongs to us tonight. || I don’t think being a comedian gives you any fucking insight into what makes people laugh. || If you absolutely believe that what you do is right, you're bullet-proof. || It never occurred to them that God may have provided the world with a vast array of very brainy medical types for the very reason of solving problems such as theirs. However, there is one thing that the medical profession cannot do and that is save people from being idiots. || Nothing says romance like hobos, martyrs and decapitations. || Aphrodisiacs come in many forms: food, drink, the internet... || It's tricky turning a book into a movie. Sometimes people love the book so much that no adaptation lives up to what they imagined. You can avoid that disappointment by never, ever reading books. || I'm so excited about the new iPad, I just iPeed my iPants. || You know who sang at Rush Limbaugh's wedding? Elton John! According to Rush, gay people can sing at weddings. Just not their own. || There are rumors that there is a John Edwards sex tape. People say it's twenty minutes of Edwards caressing and stroking... And that's just the part where he fixes his hair. || It's a great day for Sarah Palin. She was hired as a commentator for Fox News. She signed a multi-year contract, which means she'll probably quit after a year. || There is a new bill in the Senate that is upsetting a lot of people. This bill would give the President the power to shut off the Internet. Al Gore is strongly opposed to it. Not because he invented the Internet. Because he did. But because he just signed up for Match.com. || Did you hear about Mark Sanford, the governor of South Carolina? He mysteriously disappeared last week and nobody knew where he was. Today, Sanford admitted to having an affair in Argentina. I'm like, great, now we're outsourcing mistresses. || Sarah Palin is speaking out about the oil spill. She said, I'm not kidding, we should ask the Dutch for help with the spill because the Dutch have the world's best dikes. So let me get this straight. It is OK to cover lesbians in oil but you just can't let them get married. || My job is to find the politicians and the presidents and the pompous people who are telling other people how to live, powerful, visible creatures and... go at them. || I know what you're thinking: yet another late night talk show host accusing Neil Sedaka of being a war criminal. || It's a great day for America, everybody! It's Monday, woo. || You know, where I come from, an antique, to be called an antique, it has to be at least a hundred years old. That's a law: before you can call something an antique, it has to be a hundred years old. In L.A., something that's been around for a couple of weeks is an antique. It's true! People are like, ""Look at this old-fashioned iPod. Look at this! It's the size of a man's hand! Ha ha ha ha. Back then-back then, people thought Mel Gibson was just acting crazy. It was a very different time."" || I think people are as individual as snowflakes, they kinda look alike but no two are the exactly the same, and all classification is the root of prejudice. || Santa blows all these shipping companies away. He delivers more than 2 billion packages in just 24 hours. He does it by sleigh. He doesn’t use tracking numbers and doesn’t use trucks. He just uses midgets and a giant bag. || The queen banishes Snow White because of her beauty. But the dwarves help Snow White because they're smitten by that very beauty. It teaches kids an important lesson: Nothing matters except for your looks. || There is a new survey out about the happiest professions. I think the whole premise is flawed. You're supposed to find true happiness outside of work. From friends, family, and YouTube videos of old people falling down. || The 3-D effects in ""Star Wars"" are so realistic, you can actually see George Lucas reaching from the screen and taking the money from your wallet. || The whole idea of re-releasing old movies does bother me a little bit. If they're going to re-release an old movie, I should be able to get in with my old ticket. || If you can't trust, you can't be trustworthy. || Ocean's 13 is all about cool people having a good time, and who doesn't want to see that? Well you, apparantly, 'cause you're watching me. || Always laugh second. || School did give me one of the greatest gifts of my life, though. I learned how to read, and for that I remain thankful. I would have died otherwise. As soon as I was able, I read, alone. Under the covers with a flashlight or in my corner of the attic - I sought solace in books. It was from books that I started to get an inkling of the kinds of assholes I was dealing with. I found allies too, in books, characters my age who were going through or had triumphed against the same bullshit. || There's something spiritual in hard work. Spirituality isn't all aromatherapy and scented candles. || The nation of Iran is threatening to sue the makers of the movie ""Argo."" They say the movie was an unrealistic portrayal of their country. You can’t do that! That would be like Scotland suing over the movie ""Shrek."" || A new study says by 2030 household robots will dominate every phase of our lives. The study says the No. 1 field for robot growth is medicine. That makes sense. Robots already perform well in surgery. That is, until there is a power outage. Then it’s just a coat rack leaning over you as you bleed to death. || During the cold war, West Berlin was an ""exclave"" - a tiny outpost of liberalism surrounded by people who want to crush it. It was like Austin, Texas. || There's going to be a new cable-TV channel for dogs. Dogs don't even watch TV. But the schedule came out today. And they've got great shows, like ""Barks & Recreation"" and ""Game of Bones."" || I think I'll be Scottish in every movie I write. They always try to talk me out of it, but Woody Allen is always a nebbish New Yorker. Why shouldn't I be a goofy Glaswegian? || A woman in Germany gave birth to a 13 1/2 pound baby. That baby was so fat his first word was ""strudel."" || People are saying that Anderson Cooper could be the new Oprah. And then these people are struck by lightning. || There are bound to be some lies here, but I’ve been telling them so long they’ve become truth, my truth, as close as I can get to what really happened. || Appear tougher or cooler or funnier than you feel and there is a chance you’ll make it. || I don't just like sexual double entendres I love them, I stroke them, I milk them, I spank them when they're naughty. || Ros was dead. He had loved heroin more than it loved him. I was shocked beyond imagining; he was the first of my friends to fall. || You die alone in your house, and your cat will eat you. || Confession is a sacred rite enhanced by allegory, exaggeration, and lies. || An 83-year-old male prostitute was arrested. Police say he only charged $20 an hour, but for most of that time, he just talked about his grandkids. || I did have a love for literature that overpowered my hatred of the people who taught it, and I think because I had no respect for the teachers, their attitude didn’t poison the writing that I was discovering for myself. || America, for me, is a philosophical and emotional decision... It’s a flag and an idea. It’s a dream. || The virus in the movie 'Contagion' is based on the bird flu which came out of nowhere back in 2008. Everyone thought it was going to change the way we live and it just faded away. Wait a minute, I'm talking about President Obama. || Calling Angelina Jolie a husband stealer is like calling Hitler a vegetarian. It’s true, but it’s hardly the fuckin’ story, is it? || Like many of her sex, Sophie was fiercely competitive with other women, working on the crackpot theory that if she could be better in some way, men would like her more, respect her. Make her happy. She never cottoned on that the men she was attracted to, the men who found her attractive, didn’t like women. || Lance Armstrong admitted he used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career. He confessed in front of the most respected judge in the land, Oprah Winfrey. || It takes a long time to become a lawyer because you need three things - a bachelor’s degree, a law degree, and a desire to worship Satan. || Fraser’s mother, Janice, was actually quite a happy soul but she had to hide it because, like all pseudo-intellectuals, she thought being cheery made her look stupid, which of course she was for believing that rubbish in the first place. || This is a great day for people who do what I do, this is a great day for talk-show hosts. Remember when Dick Cheney shot his lawyer in the face? It's like one of those days. It's like when Mel Gibson went crazy and blamed the Jewish people for everything, it's one of those days, it's fantastic. || Being funny is a gift, and, when done well, is an art form. || Evil does not question itself. Only Hope questions itself. || Being guilty tends to engender feelings of guilt. || Like most sharks, Margaret liked to think of herself as a victim of the cruel sea. || They could have gotten help for this infertility but they believed that interfering with the reproductive process, even if it was faulty, was anti-God. It was against His plan. It never occurred to them that God may have provided the world with a vast array of very brainy medical types for the very reason of solving problems such as theirs. However, there is one thing that the medical profession cannot do and that is save people from being idiots. || I can't live by your rules, man! || Another innocent victim of my pointless rage. || You don't say 'we're suspending the campaign'! You can't say that! We didn't sus-, you can't, it's the democratic process! We didn't suspend it for 9/11, we didn't suspend it for Pearl Harbor, we didn't suspend it for the Nazis, we didn't suspend it for the damn British! We don't do that in America! We don't! There's no suspending the campaign! Democracy first! || Oh, this isn't a talk show; it's more just filling time, really, 'til the infomercials start. || Mark Zuckerberg was named Time's Person of the Year. I'm sorry if you don't recognize the name. A magazine is something people used to read. || Kids: If a bear is wearing a ranger hat, it's because he ate the ranger! || I dont know how to add things to my own wikipedia page. || I found the prospect daunting, but somehow comforting, too, because the counselors insisted it could be done, and, after all, many of them were recovering alcoholics themselves. || I found out it is just as hard to make a movie that you are not proud of as it is to make one you love. || Got married again and I went on the Internet to see how happy everyone was for me. Fucking hell, it was awful. One woman... she said, 'Married again, eh? She's a user and he's a pervert.' And I'm like, 'How do they know us?' || David Letterman is the king of late-night television. My relationship with David Letterman is that I sit at his feet. That's what it is. I'm kind of his bitch. || They’ve found a link between chemicals in shampoo and obesity. If you’re eating shampoo, your weight is the least of your concerns. || Last night, I got Chinese food and the fortune cookie said, ‘Where’s my money?’ || Pies were invented 12,000 years ago by the Egyptians. It was an easy way to preserve food that would be carried over long distances. They were like ancient Slim Jims. || They say give a man a fish and he’ll eat for a day. But teach a man to fish and he’ll get his own show on the Discovery Channel. || In a Scottish opera, it ain't over 'till the fat lady bitch-slaps you. || For a while, some schools across the country were banning spelling bees. For obvious reasons, of course - steroids || I didn't say no because between safety and adventure I choose adventure. || In Los Angeles on Black Friday, a woman pepper sprayed Wal-Mart shoppers who tried to cut in line. The police acted fast by immediately hiring her to get rid of peaceful protesters outside banking institutions all across the United States. || It's very interesting to know what people are doing while you're working on late-night television. || The idea of having Australians upset at me is just awful. || The truth is, you win the Lotto. That's really how you have to approach it. You're a lottery winner when you get a sitcom and it goes. || You know, your whole life you're concerned about money for this and that. And then you don't have to worry about it, so you worry about other stuff. || I just do my thing and try each show to be more honest about why I am and who I am. It's quite tricky and actually nerve-racking to do that. It's kind of a happy train wreck. || I remember talking to someone early on after I was sober about how I suddenly felt awkward at parties. They said, 'Well, you're supposed to. Everyone feels awkward at parties.' It's an appropriate feeling to feel. || I'm crazy. I know I'm crazy 'cause Desmond Tutu told me, and he's very clever. He said, 'You must free yourself, be more of who you are. Be more crazy.' And I'm going to. || I am reasonably happy. I didn't find Jesus or anything like that. Part of it is that I just feel that I could go home. I did not feel like that for a long time, but I could go back now. || I come from a very critical culture. You know the Scots. They're always saying: 'Oh, no. It will never work. You'll never amount to anything. You've got to know your place in the world.' || I do a show. It comes on late at night on TV. And if that means I'm a late-night talk show host, then I guess I am, but in every other regard I resign my commission, I don't care for it. || I said that the only way I could have a band that would work in the format of my show is if the band were crap. So if I have a band they'd have to really suck. || I used to psych myself up before the show and now I do the complete opposite: I psych myself down. It's 12:30 at night, you don't want some guy yelling at you. You want some guy just talking to you. || It's like, it's kind of like if you ever had a car and it was a bit of a clunker but you love it, that's my show. It's a bit of a clunker but I know where everything is and I like it. || My mother was tickled and I think kind of proud when my father got hit on my an attractive middle-aged Asian lady who hadn't noticed he was with his family. He was certainly pleased about it. || Time is only linear for engineers and referees. || It's all about the triumph of intellect and romance over brute force and cynicism. || A new restaurant here in Southern California requires women to wear high heels. I’m outraged! This is sexist! Why just the women? || I became a terrible drunk or alcoholic - or a good one depending on your point of view. || I was 15 years old when I was in this band; we were called Stag. We used to wear spandex pants and no underwear - we looked like marbles smugglers. || It's the beauty and curse of doing a daily show. Some days you've got nothing to talk about and other days Dick Cheney shoots his lawyer in the face and everyone is happy. || Late night is no different than making a film, really, except that it's faster, and if you do a crap one, you can do a better one tomorrow. Writing a novel and doing stand-up - that stuff is very similar. || Scotland is a much lighter and more fun place than I thought it was. I was miserable when I was there. But it wasn't Scotland's fault. It was my circumstances. I was - I hate to say the word humbled - but that's what it felt like. I was wrong about this place. This is a great place full of very fun people. || There's just a feeling you get from certain things you do in life that just kind of feel pure and independent of what's actually, physically, going on. || It's not that we fly by the seat of our pants. We're not afraid of failure. || Why do people do things that they fear? It may be that the fear contains information. Something can be interesting if you get to the other side of that fear. || Is it really that important? It's just television, for God's sake. It's not medicine or something. || If Scotland and America go to war, I'm afraid I've already sworn in. || A friend of mine that I was in a band with started me on Kafka, which in turn led to Camus and Sartre. || A lot of people come to L.A. looking for something. What I came here for, I realize now, is to be okay with myself. || All they teach you in drama school is how to do stage fights and be a pain in rehearsals. || Don't ever rope me in as a late-night talk show host. I don't want to be one. || HD doesn't mean anything to me. It's a technical thing. It's like demographics. A lot of people know about it. || Historically, when Americans don't know what to do next, they go to Paris. Benjamin Franklin is like: 'What am I going to do now? I'll go to Paris!' || I aim to please. I'm nothing if not a vaudevillian. || I don't get emails from my corporate overlords. || I don't know now if I'm funny. I just keep talking and hope that I hit something that's funny. || I don't see my show as a stepping stone to something else like some people, who get a job then have a foot out the door looking for their next job. || Justin Bieber’s tour bus was stopped by Canadian border patrol agents. And they found marijuana. The agents said Bieber was a disgrace to Canada and should never come back. Then they found the marijuana. || It was on this day that the Bahamas declared independence. Before that they were a British colony. The British Empire lost Canada and the Bahamas, to name just a couple. Britain’s been dumped more times than Taylor Swift. But did they go writing whining songs about it? No. || From 1934 to 1963, the biggest criminals in America ended up on Alcatraz. Nowadays they end up on Wall Street. || I have no ambitions beyond being comfortable in what I do for a living - and earning a living. || I have to do a show which is of interest to me, or else I'm lost. || I hope what I do has an art to it, and as an artist you have to try new things and keep yourself entertained. || Gas prices - it is $6 a gallon here. People in L.A. are furious. You can’t tell, of course, because of the Botox. || I think I'm just someone that just tries to get by. I'm kind of - if it was during the Second World War, I'd be a black marketeer, I think. || I try and live my life in bite-size chunks. || I wanted to be a rock star. || I'm a terrible interviewer. I'm not a journalist - although I have a Peabody Award - and I'm not really a late-night host. What I am is honest. || I've got young kids, so it suits me to do a job which keeps me in town right now. || I've started looking at my own father a bit funny. He assures me, though, that I really am the son of a Scottish postman. || If we are now holding late-night talk-show hosts to the same moral accountability as we hold politicians or clergymen, I'm out. I'm gone. || I think sometimes that people think brave means not being afraid, which of course it doesn't mean that at all. It means that you're afraid, but you move past that and do it anyway, do what you think is right. || If I start giving people what they like I'll turn into one of them and I don't want to be one of them I want to be one of me. || Everything I think of now is too rude to actually say. || In the past I’ve been hard on the vegans. I’ve called them Prius-driving fascists, but now I am one of them. I have been turned to the dark side. || Some people watching CNN were so shocked they started rioting. No, I’m kidding. No one watches CNN. || For me, the best Valentine’s Day gifts don’t cost anything because they come straight from the heart. That’s why I composed a special Valentine’s Day poem for you, my audience. “Roses are red, love’s but a fable. I’m really sorry you can’t afford cable.” || Here in Los Angeles, school’s out for summer. For thousands of school kids, this is the first week of summer vacation. And for thousands of parents, it’s the first week of hell. || The term ""Big Brother"" is from George Orwell's book ""1984"" - where everyone’s watched over by a network of cameras called Big Brother. I’ve never understood why Orwell chose that phrase for somebody watching you all the time. Isn't that more like ""Creepy Uncle""? || Today in New York City, Sarah Palin had a meeting with Donald Trump. Now, experts say if those two joined forces on a Presidential ticket it would be the greatest gift ever given to comedy. || Sober alkies are often asked: ""When did you hit rock bottom?"" but a more informed question might be: ""How many times did you hit rock bottom?"" || I'm TV's Craig Ferguson, please sit down relax and: ""take off your pants""; ""dip your hand into a bowl of warm water and fall fast asleep""; etc. || Former president Bill Clinton was elected on this very day in 1992. Clinton went on to leave quite a mark in the oval office... You mean the one on the sofa? || Technically my dog's naked most of the time. Except halloween, when I dress him up as Liza Minelli. || During a fundraising trip to California, some young Republicans took the Republican Party credit card to a club in Hollywood that has nude dancers doing bondage shows. Usually when Republicans find themselves in dark rooms with whips and chains, it's in Dick Cheney's basement. || What we do have is nothin' but time. Welcome to the ""Shawshank Redemption"" of late night! || It turns out that speeding irresponsibly in a large truck, placing personal wealth ahead of the welfare of others, is one of the greatest sins in the Universe... || I think comedy as an art involves the audience as a participant as much as is involves the artist. || I didn't flee a dictator or swim an ocean to be an American like some do. I just thought long and hard about it. || By the power of Steven Wright's Beard! || Laughter separates us from despair, and gives us a chance at love. || You better watch out. You better not cry. You better not pout, I'm telling you why, 'cause Santa Clause might put a cap in your ass. || I always wanted to make motion pictures, ever since I was a wee boy, and I was 32, and time was marching on. I met a guy who said, 'Come out to Hollywood for 10 days, and I'll get you a deal.' So I figured, 'OK, 10 days.' On the 10th day, he got me a development deal with Disney, not for a lot of money, but it allowed me to make the move. || I realized women and humor were linked very closely. || I think when you become a parent you go from being a star in the movie of your own life to the supporting player in the movie of someone else's. || He will know from and early age that failure is not disgrace. It's just a pitch that you missed, and you'd better get ready for the next one. The next one might be the shot heard round the world. My son and I are Americans, we prepare for glory by failing until we don't. || The problem with suicide is that it seems so flamboyant. It’s camp. You have to be a bit of a drama queen to ever seriously consider it. || My father had a very unusual psychic ability, he could detect water. It's called divining. He would use a Y-shaped U-branch, and he could find water with that, which is a very impressive skill in a country where it rains 365 days of the year. || You gotta laugh because if you didn't you'd cry. || Every day I ran to that book like it was a bottle of whiskey and crawled inside because it was a world that I had at least some control over, and slowly, in time, it began to take shape. || This is my first week as an American citizen. It's amazing. Now I can vote in the general election - and for American Idol. || Anyone who's just driven 90 yards against huge men trying to kill them has earned the right to do Jazz hands. || I'm gonna enjoy being old I think I'll be awesome at it. || I don’t think there’s anything wrong with telling the truth. I know it isn’t fashionable. || I freely admit I'm confused. I'm a confused and troubled individual but at the same time... It's free! || You clap. The Censor wakes up. We all get into trouble. || Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde is a metaphor for alcoholism. He drinks a potion, becomes a monster. I know exactly how he feels. || The views expressed by me are in no way endorsed by CBS any of its allied companies or in fact me. || I have a deep and profound mistrust of all politicians. || Welcome back, my cheeky wee monkeys. || I only like sports that Bond villains played. || I enjoy bathing, as many Europeans don't. || Wait! Don't applaud my cheapness! I've got other crap I need help with! || The legendary Dick Van Dyke on the show tonight. The actor not the pubic beard style. Although... maybe it's time for something new. || If it doesn't work, at least it will be an interesting train wreck. || This job has explained to me who I am - I'm not kidding. I always knew I was an actor, but kind of not. I always knew I was a writer, but kind of not. I knew was a producer, but kind of not. It's really a peculiar confluence of skills and experiences that put you in the right position to do this job. But I know now what I am. I'm this. Whatever this is. Now that I know this it's really helped me in my life. || It's totally free. It is the complete freedom of performance. The first time the monologue is performed is when you see it on TV, and it'll never be seen again. It's pure TV. Bam! It's there, and then it's gone. || It's clearly yen positive, especially when China is gradually allowing the yuan to appreciate day by day. || The prospect of an interest-rate-hike lifeline for the currency has become even more remote. The coming week will be the most important for the currency of any in the next three months. || That's one of the reasons why we think the U.S. dollar probably should strengthen going into the Fed meeting toward the end of the month. || Friday's turmoil in global markets looks set to continue to exert a dominant force on the foreign exchange markets. The usual trend when U.S. stocks fall is that the U.S. dollar suffers. || We wanted something different this year. We're still keeping the musicianship, as opposed to it being a jam band fest. There's also a lot more standard bluegrass acts and we've never had an act like Bobby McFerrin before. You don't have to be a bluegrass artist - you just have to be a great artist to fit in at Telluride. || If the Fed ceases hiking, against the backdrop of still rising commodity prices, then the Australian dollar will have few reasons for resisting any topside advances. || It's a book. It's mine. And it's done. || I think in our desire to create a better America, we have to have civilized debate in this country and not just yelling. || I think comedy comes more from a low sense of self-esteem, and I certainly have that. || I proved to my own satisfaction that I am madder than I think. || Strange star-like object over Oslo right before Obama arrives. A gift of a golden medal given by a group of wise men... Nah. || This book could scare them. The sex, the violence, the dream sequences and the iconoclasm - I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with that. I understand that. It was very uncomfortable to write some of it. || I view my own body as a petting zoo. I am the main attraction... And the only customer. || I used to love going fishing. I think it was really about the clothes. Nothing says real man like a vest with 38 pockets and a mesh hat with hooks in it. || I grew up in Scotland in the 1970s. There was not much money. The most popular Christmas toy was probably a potato. || I don't know why some people get worked up about gay people marrying. It's not gay people who are ""ruining the sanctity of marriage,"" it's celebrities. || My son's always showing me pictures of dinosaurs and asking me what their names are. I dont know so I make stuff up: That son is a thesaurus. || New iPod. It looks like an iPhone but it can't make phone calls. So its really just an iPhone. || Don't hit women. Never, ever, ever. || Sarah Palin has managed to use her failed vice presidential run to put herself in a position of power and influence. Joe Biden won the race and he hasn't been able to put himself in a position of power and influence. || Democrats are calling Christine O'Donnell 'the Sarah Palin of the East.' Really? She's a loud, emotionally unstable woman from Delaware. That's not Sarah Palin, that's Joe Biden. || After Joe Wilson's outburst, everyone was shocked. Because usually when a politician shoots off his mouth and makes a fool of himself, his name is Joe Biden. But even Biden said he was embarrassed by Wilson's behavior. This is Joe Biden we're talking about. Joe Biden saying it's embarrassing is like an Australian bartender saying you've had too much to drink. || Delaware Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell said recently that Hollywood needs to re-evaluate what they're doing because movies these days are all filled with gay sex and extramarital affairs. And I thought, 'Have fun in Congress then.' || That's not really wrestling. That's just throwing a snake. || I do love America. And L. A. is a very short commute to America its like half an hour on the plane. || Violence of any kind, once it starts, is like fucking a gorilla - you ain't done till the gorilla's done. || The Bible has been through at least half a dozen translations by the time you read it. Plus, when the word of God is infected by the hand of man, that is, written down, it is tainted. || I know the fashion is that everything is fair game for comedy material but I don't believe that. || I think commercialism helps Christmas and I think that the more capitalism we can inject into the Christmas holiday the more spiritual I feel about it. || For my birthday that year Anne gave me an inflatable atlas globe, along with a birthday card in which she wrote: ""I give you the world. Have fun blowing it up."" || Oh Satan you're a wily one. || Harry Potter, he sends a message on Owl Mail while us poor old muggles have to make do with instantaneous emails and texting. Oh, if only we could be like you Harry Potter, with your four day owl delivery! || The worst gift I was given is when I got out of rehab that Christmas; a bottle of wine. It was delicious. || Nobody talks about sex in Scotland. Scottish gynecologists don't even talk about sex. It's just like: 'Get up on the table there, Mrs. Henderson. Lift up your skirt. We'll take a look at your magic baby door.' || Italian women are some of the most beautiful in the world. This is why the Vatican is in Italy. If a man can walk across Italy and retain his celibacy, he’s got what it takes to be a priest - or an interior decorator. || Donald Trump showed his birth certificate to reporters. Who cares about his birth certificate? I want to know if that thing on his head has had its vaccinations. || Even a chameleon needs the proper amount of suction. || You can never talk religion on network TV. It makes too many people angry. You can talk about sex. || I haven't had a drink in thirteen years, but occasionally I'm tempted to have one beer. The problem is that if I have that one beer, I wake up in Tijuana four days later with a tattoo and a sore ass. || For example, in Paris, if one desires to buy something, you enter the store and say ""Good morning, sir"" or ""madam,"" depending on what is appropriate, you wait until you are greeted, you make polite chitchat about the weather or some such, and when the salesperson asks what they can do for you, then and only then do you bring up the vulgar business of the transaction you require. || Pseudoscience describes theories that sound like science but are actually just made up, like aromatherapy or biorhythms or love. || Change is the law of God's mind and resistance to it is the source of all pain. || Sounds like a party at Elton John's house. || The difference between a broadcaster and a host is that a host tells stories and dumb jokes, but a broadcaster can articulate deeper like, you know - things and stuff. || I don’t know much about the Supreme Court. If it’s anything like the Supreme Taco, it’s like a regular court, but with extra sour cream. || Researchers in Britain claim they have created a gel that prevents tooth decay. We’ve got this in America. It’s called “toothpaste.” || We are $14.3 trillion in debt, but the good news is we’ve got 14.3 trillion airline miles. || According to a new study, our email is not as safe as we thought. How do they know this? They’ve been reading my email. || I’ve never understood why they call junk mail “spam,” because spam is delicious and junk mail is annoying. But you can still find both under my couch. || I’m hooked on email. That’s right, kids, I’m one of you. || So far rich people have been very quiet about the possibility of getting taxes raised on them, but that doesn’t mean they won’t get mad about it, it just means they don’t know about it. Because it takes a while for bad news to reach a rich person. First their accountant has to tell the butler, who has to tell the servant, who wouldn’t dare interrupt their game of croquet. || I would prefer as a viewer to watch the mistakes. I am my own blooper reel, as it happens. || I don't want to be poor. I don't want to be rich to the extent that all I care about is keeping my job. I don't care enough about keeping my job right now. That's good. That makes effective at what I do. I don't want to be frightened of getting fired. So to that end I suppose my ambitions are that I spend less than I earn. || I don't know what the fuck was going on with the Scottish education board in the 1970's. It was like: 'Do you like whiskey? Do you hate kids? The job's yours.' || If you know anything about me - and, if you do, I’m sorry that your life turned out like that. || I'm careful with money. || Being an American is something I wanted to be for a very long time, probably since I saw the moon landing when I was a child. || I came to America, and I made good. It's an old story, but it hasn't been told in a long time. Usually, it's, 'I'm an immigrant, I came here and got persecuted.' My story is I came here, I worked hard, and it worked out all right. So it's still available. || Other than the laws of physics, rules have never really worked out for me. || Look, there is nothing you can say about this show that I don't already know. || Old people really do have a secret though. You wanna know what it is? Luck. || Much of television has been homogenized in the desire to avoid annoying or upsetting people. || Sometimes my pathology just spills out into the camera, doesn't it? || Stand by your bed and salute me. || America truly is the best idea for a country that anyone has ever come up with so far. Not only because we value democracy and the rights of the individual, but because we are always our own most effective voice of descent... We must never mistake disagreement between Americans on political or moral issues to be an indication of their level of patriotism. If you don't like what I say or don't agree with where I stand on certain issues, then good. I'm glad we're in America, and don't have to oppress each other over it. We're not just a nation, we're not an ethnicity. We are a dream of justice that people have had for a thousand years. || It seemed that I performed better sober than drunk. Who knew? || I don't think wood was discovered in Britain until the 1970's. That's when I discovered it anyway. || Well, everyone, welcome to Shark Week. Oh that's on CBS and there's been a lot of cutbacks, so it's just Friday night for a couple of minutes. And we don't have any sharks, just an immigrant with a puppet. Hey, but it's a start! || At CBS, I’m in your house. I’m mindful of that. When I do standup, you’re in my home and I can say what I want to. || Remember the band, Flock of Seagulls? They had their van stolen. I was like, ""They still have a van?"" || ""The Smurfs 2"" is a great movie. The Smurfs are tiny little creatures that everybody loves. They’re like Justin Bieber - minus the part about everybody loving him. || Larry King has been married more times than Henry the Eighth. We used to have that rhyme to keep track of them. 'Divorced, beheaded, died. Divorced, beheaded, survived.' With Larry I think it goes, 'Divorced, beheaded, divorced, escaped. Zombie, lesbian, disappeared, inflatable.' || I don't like the whole blowing the candles out ritual... blowing their germs all over the cake. If I want to catch something on my birthday. I don't want it to be from the cake. If you know what I'm saying... || I'm not so much a dragon slayer, more a dragon annoyer - I'm a dragon irritater. || The wedding took place in Vermont, where they have legalized gay civil unions, and I married a woman. || It's easier to feel a little more spiritual with a couple of bucks in your pocket. || The most popular Valentine’s Day gift is chocolate. In the 1800's, doctors told their patients to eat chocolate to get over a broken heart. They also thought if you’re going to be alone, who cares if you get fat. || I am the Saudi Arabia of unhappiness. I have so many reserves of misery that you wouldn't understand. I actually think that's part of why I connect with Canadians. I think they understand grinding misery underneath. || I have a beard. Just not on my face... || Sometimes people think you’re smart if you question the status quo, if nothing else. || Divorce lawyers stoke anger and fear in their clients, knowing that as long as the conflicts remain unresolved the revenue stream will keep flowing. || When I went out on tour as Bing Hitler I would hook up with Lenny and we'd get drunk together. He was always very supportive. He was a big star and a lot of what he said to me had power and impact. Apart from that, I just like him. || I dropped out of high school when I was 16, after I had a huge argument with my English teacher over the meaning of the word 'existentialism.' || I got sober. I stopped killing myself with alcohol. I began to think: 'Wait a minute - if I can stop doing this, what are the possibilities?' And slowly it dawned on me that it was maybe worth the risk. || I've been running my whole life. Running into bars, running around the world. But when you have a child, you can't run. That was a revelation. || I like football. I find its an exciting strategic game. It's a great way to avoid conversation with your family at Thanksgiving. || Twas the night before Thanksgiving. All the food's in the oven. And I'm in the bedroom performin' self lovin'. || I watched the Republican debate. At one point, the candidates said there are no classes in America, a point then hotly debated by all six rich white guys that were there. || If a man doesn't know how to dance he doesn't know how to make love, there I said it! || A junkie will steal your purse, and then help you look for it. || Tomorrow is your future's yesterday. || Anyway, if you needed something really dangerous, get a gun. It's easy, it's cheap, and it's the American way. || Self help books are pointless. Here's something for you... Men are from Mars, women are from Venus, and self help books are from Uranus. || The sexy magazine in Britain in that time was called Club International. Club International: It was about as international as the International House of Pancakes. It should have been called Naked Cockney Girls with Scurvy. || Rush Limbaugh says if the health care bill passes, he will leave the country. The Democrats are upset, because if they knew that, they would have passed the bill years ago. || Apple released the upgraded version of the iPhone 4, called the iPhone 4S. I think the ""S"" stands for ""suckers."" || These days, teachers have it rough. Kids can be hyperactive, disobedient, and obnoxious. It must feel like being locked in a room of drunk midgets. || That’s the thing about terrorism - it works. Especially for the terrorists - they might not get what they want but it feels damn good trying. || President Obama was in Indonesia today, and he spent a lot of his childhood there. It was like Dick Cheney going back to visit the Death Star. || Comic-Con starts today. It’s a four-day celebration of science fiction and comics. Every year, an army of geeks descends on San Diego. If you live anywhere other than San Diego and you need a computer fixed, you’re screwed. || You know who they're blaming for global warming now? This is true. Fat people. || I am probably a pseudo-intellectual. || Maybe fear is God's way of saying, ""Pay attention, this could be fun"". || Oprah's quitting in 2011. Now we know why the Mayans ended their calendar in 2012. || I have that hypocrisy of a parent in that I'm like, 'Come on, you've got to toughen up at the same time let me take care of that for you.' || On that same tour we ran into a band at Aylesbury Friars, a biggish venue in Oxfordshire, England. They were a four-piece from Ireland called U2. They seemed like nice fellows and they sounded pretty good, but we didn’t keep in touch. They’re probably taxi drivers and accountants by now. || When I stopped drinking, it was only because I thought if I don't stop, I'm going to die. || There is no Thanksgiving back in the old country where I come from. You know why? Because being thankful is a sin. || I think that clearly it has an influence, to be coming of age during the punk rock era, to come from a difficult and sporadically violent background, to have been in and out of such chaos, I think it actually helps. But I don't know for sure. || If I have a near-beer, I’m near beer. And if I’m near beer, I’m close to tequila. And if I’m close to tequila, I’m adjacent to cocaine. || I used to believe, like many people who come from poor backgrounds, that it gave me an edge, but I think that's just something we have to tell ourselves to get by sometimes. I don't believe that anymore. Children of privilege can be just as talented and clever as anybody else. || I've got mixed feelings about poetry cause done well poetry is fantastic. But not many people are capable of doing it well. I think you should have some kind of license to perform poetry. A poetic license perhaps. || I'm not aware of having a creepy laugh, but apparently I do. || I love zombies. If any monster could Riverdance, it would be zombies."
D. L. Hughley,"Everybody wants to be great at something. || Black folks never bungie jump. That’s too much like lynching for us. ""I'm gonna let you tie a rope around me and push me off a bridge? You must be out your damn mind."" || One of the most beautiful things in the world I've ever seen or heard is people laughing, even when there seems to be so little reason for them to laugh. || There's something about having a great bottle of wine and a great cigar. Nothing compares to it. || There is always one person in the office that you want to whip their ass! If you don't know who it is, it is probably you. || I'd pick a young white guy over an old white guy for president anytime because the younger guy is more likely to have been influenced by the great social changes of the '60s and '70s. || I used to always run off at the mouth and talk about people. I just didn't know that it would make a living for me. || I think politics in general are just like a popularity contest but McCain is just… old. || I'm not gonna lie, I love the holidays. But Christmas was a lot more fun when you weren't paying for it. || That's sort of a silly question. Day 15 is too soon, but Day 16 is all right? || You can't fire white folk. You fire white folk, you'd best believe somebody gettin' shot that day. ""I'm fired? I'll be right back, you sons of bitches...!"" You fire a brother, we be mad for a different reason. ""How come you didn't call me at home, motherfucker? You knew I was fired yesterday! Makin' me burn up all my goddamn gas..."" || They didn't have to describe Jesus to me for me to know he's black. Jesus' first miracle was turning water into wine at a wedding. Now if that ain't black folk, I don't know what is. || Every group has its idiosyncrasies, but at a certain point we all are human. || You know what so funny, this strike has been going on for a long time. It's lasted longer than the Civil Rights movement, what the hell is this? It's painfully obvious to me white people don't know how to protest. You need like an Al Sharpton, have a dream, go to the mountaintop, do something! || No matter how bad things are, you can at least be happy that you woke up this morning. || I don't need somebody behind a desk to tell me what a marketing survey says is funny. I got 3 million miles and 70,000 tickets sold, telling me that I know how to make people laugh. || I'm glad them fucking holidays is over. ""Don't drink and drive."" Motherfucker, how am I going to get home? || Did you ever have the police follow you for so long, that you get suspicious about your own goddamn self? ""Maybe I did kill them people."" || They had this movie called Juno about a teenage girl who gets pregnant and it's nominated for an Oscar. That's an unusual experience for me, 'cause when a black girl gets pregnant it ain't no Oscar. It's social work and a box of condoms is what that is. || It's really no different for me 'cause I work for bet so it's like the writers are always on strike. || The one thing women love more than money is power."
Damon Wayans,"The less food, the more time to talk, the more to talk about. || We have four beautiful children and some wonderful memories. || My kids have a competitive drive I never had growing up. || My father is a Jehovah's Witness, and he raised us under a very strict hand. || If Mike Tyson came up to me and said, “Listen, I want to fuck you in your ass.” The toughest thing I could say back is: “For how long?! Now I need some sort of time frame, my brother! Because you ain’t gonna be fucking me all day long! Now you gotta about three hours to do what you gotta do, then the ass is mine!” || I don't ever want to be Number One because once you become Number One, you start to change. || And for my family, comedically, that was the key to a lot of the humor. || This town was built on nepotism. || When people didn't know me and I was doing stand-up. That's when I was most creative. || I can't play no slave. I got three kids, man. How my kids going to respect me if they see me playing a slave? ""Little Damon, you get down off that chair before I spank your behind."" ""Yeah, you weren't so tough when mastuh was kicking your ass."" || Let me tell you something ass-eyes, let me tell you all something: war has made me very paranoid! and when you get to eye-balling me, makes my Agent Orange act up, makes me want to kill! || When I want to see the people I grew up with, most of the time I just go to the morgue. || I found out one of my old partners, Larry, is in jail now. Larry got 25 years for something he didn't do. He didn't run fast enough. || Some struggle is healthy. If you can embrace it rather than be angry, you can use it as your pilot light. || I was 12 years old when I had my first job, delivering packages. || Allow me to expose my colon once again. The ramification inflicted on the incision placed within the Fallopian cavities serves to be holistic taken from the Latin word ""jalapeno"". || I never thought about being famous. || But my kids, my brothers' kids - they think about trying to top what we did. || They strip search you in jail. Dudes sit in the booth and looks up my ass. Right away I’m thinking, ""What in the world am I going to put up my ass that I'm gonna use again?"" Like I’m supposed to get inside. ""All right. Who wants gum?"" || And my marriage was perfect when I wasn't famous. || My father was the guy on the block who said hi to everyone. || Save yer breath! That's just another long list of lies perpetrated by The Man to keep a brutha down! || See what we have here is a failure to communicate. || I had a great childhood growing up even though we was crazy poor. We was like P O. We couldn't afford O R. That's how Po we were… I remember nights we didn't eat. We had sleep for dinner. || Being a celebrity, I don't even have to talk. || I wouldn't dignify that with a response. || You'd better not kill me, man, I've got shit to do tomorrow! || The show has become my therapy. || Nobody can stop you but you. And shame on you if you're the one who stops yourself. || From now on, my little group of shaved scrotum sacks, you will walk like me, talk like me, eat like me, and until you win those games, you will be bald like me."
Dana Carvey,"Wouldn't be prudent. Not gonna do it'. || Now... just wait a minute. Did I start talking Portuguese up here and not realize it? || You cannot pee in a Mr. Coffee and get Taster's Choice. || A mom and dad found an S&M magazine under their 10-year-old son's bed, and the dad said, ''Well, we sure can't spank him.'' || We didn't even think about it, you know? I used to collect laser discs, and you'd have some college professor analyzing It's a Wonderful Life or Citizen Kane, and now it is pretty funny - the idea of commentary for a silly kid's movie, you know? || My characters all start with rhythms and sounds. Once I hear the voice and get into the rhythm, the attitude and the physicality just come out on their own. || I have this dream life where I get to be a celebrity but I get to navigate the world fairly easily because I'm always in character. || I couldn't do any of my other characters, you know? But I could have done the lady. Church Lady's Malibu Beach party is an idea I have for a movie, too. Yes. || I had written in another draft a completely different kind of fight, but they said they couldn't afford to shoot it. They needed a fight scene, though, so I was told to put a fight scene in, but not the one I had written. || I recently found out about this other super movie star. He only works from about 11:00 to 4:00, so all his movies take like 120 days. But this was a lot of stuff to do in 35 days. || I've never really worked on them. Just once in a while one hits me and makes me laugh. My Al Gore was sort of like a gay Gomer Pyle. || It's almost like he's started to sound even more exotic the more people started doing him. I don't know why, but there's just something about Al Gore that makes me laugh. || Well, isn't that special? || My fate is very precarious. I don't want the show to suffer because I may not be able to come back next week. || I pretty much try to stay in a constant state of confusion just because of the expression it leaves on my face. || I can tell you now what I couldn't tell the studio then: Purely in case the movie was like a monster smash, I would have gotten too recognized. || Please, O ye Lord, keep Jim Bakker behind bars. || When people come to see my stand-up, they get a chance to see my characters interact with each other. I enjoy pushing my characters to the limit. No matter how far out there I go, I look for things that make the characters human. While many comics have a secret persona, I fundamentally want to be myself. || I'm a friend of the CEO of Twitter and he showed me how to be on it, but it causes such an uproar if what you post is perceived in a negative light. || This movie will actually increase the sex life of parents everywhere because they can put this on, with the 45 minutes of extras and they've got almost two hours to do whatever they've got to do while the kids watch the movie. || I'm thirty years old, but I read at the thirty-four-year-old level. || So I was just sitting on my porch, just minding my own business, and this dog come up to me an says 'Hey, ain't you Ross Perot?' Well, I just about dropped a load. And you all know who the prime authority on talking dogs is? The Republican Party. I rest my case. || That's why modern corporate movie making has become so laborious that comedians are kind of kicked out by 50. || My Obama is getting pretty good ... I think I'll vote for whoever makes my portrayal easier. It takes time to put together a comic impression. It takes time to recognize the tics. Right now, for instance, I could do a dead- on Paul Ryan and people wouldn't recognize it. Personalities take a while to sin... || You know, sometimes you can't just take an armadillo, put it in the barn, light it on fire and expect it to make licorice. || A long time ago there was a lot of people... but that was a long time ago."
Dana Gould,"Is it still okay to make fun of schizophrenics? There's a little voice in my head that says no. || If Abe Lincoln took part in the Republican debates, he would look out of place with his intelligence, compassion and gaping head wound. || I don't have time to live in the moment right now. || Today I saw a guy who looked like me in a funhouse mirror. He looked at me like, ""Hey, that's how I look reflected in the pond!"" || If life begins at conception, but you can be ""born again"" later, only to live on eternally after death, what's the big deal about anything? || My plan this year is to achieve spiritual enlightenment through ceaseless competition with everything. || You rarely get a convincing lecture on ""playing to your strength"" from a bald guy with a ponytail. || I don't want to appear to be placing blame, but as far my life is concerned, everything is pretty much my dad's ball's fault. || If studies on lab rats are any indication, human beings have a deep-seated fear of a big, scary cat being let into their cage. || Like many indelible family memories, carving a pumpkin begins with someone grabbing a really sharp knife. || My father hauled boxes so I could get an education and earn enough money to pay someone to make me lift weights. || Why is it, when I have nothing to do, I drink more coffee? It's as if I'm in a big hurry to get nothing done. || This is just a hunch, but I bet airplanes think helicopters are assholes. || I would think, if you were horny enough, there'd come a time when it was hos before bros. || Every time the circus comes to town, I can't help thinking, ""Somewhere out there, there's clown semen."" || A great way to be left alone on the subway is to appear to be deep in conversation with a small knife. || Live every day as if it were your last. Then, the next day, pretend you're a ghost! || This year, I just might achieve my goal of losing interest in absolutely everything. Not that I care... || I want to leave the world as I entered it: naked and crying in a room full of strangers. || Wrote a science fiction novel about a man who wins an argument with his wife, but it was rejected for being ""too farfetched"". || A lot of people think my sarcasm comes from insecurity and defensiveness, but I assure you I'm just being petty and cruel. || Love means never having to say you're sorry.

Dane Cook,"I'm shooting a pilot based on my show. It's a one-camera show. I play myself. || In the year 3000, everything will be instant. || I love being on stage if I'm not on a set. If I'm at home, I'm usually in my office editing or reconstructing my website or whatever it may be. I just love putting creativity into a performance, so if the right script comes along, and I certainly am reading comedies and dramas now, then I'm ready willing and able to give it a shot. || When I first hit the scene, it was just a lot of go, go, go, go, go. I have a lot of natural energy anyway, but it was over the top. || When something's good, I'm not an over-celebrator. || When you are doing stand-up comedy, you are the writer, producer, director, sometimes bouncer. || You have to learn the crowd. I just pay attention to them so I can make sure I can make them laugh. || The little boy inside of all us men always loves something video game related. || I'm focused on staying as healthy as I can so I can work more. || I love hecklers. They remind you that you are a comedian. || I'm a late-night guy. || I say it with my tongue firmly planted in cheek but there's truth to it - being a comedian is very close to being a therapist. When you're working smaller clubs, you're listening. You're feeling an energy, you're going with a tone but when people start yelling out, you almost start a conversation with people. || I feel like the gods have certainly patted me on the head. || I don't laugh out loud at comics a lot. || I did stand-up comedy for seventeen years. I need to explore other things. || I can do more than just stand-up comedy, and the only way I'll be able to show that is if I do it myself. Because nobody trusts that I can do it. || I feel like I was born and bred to stay self-motivated. I'm not one of those people who ho-hums and feels sorry for himself when something's bad. || I don't write any of my material down. I like to improvise and be spontaneous. || You've gotta share what's going on in your mind. || I was doing comedy in laundry mats in 1992, literally where I would bring a little gorilla amp and a lapel mike and just start performing. || I am an observer, I like to watch people. I am into psychology and people - how they act and such. || Start each day out the holy way..with Christ Chex, it's a miracle in a bowl. Just open the box and you hear AHHHHH... and then a lil' angel flies out and says 'good morning, life is beautiful!' || I'm always going to be someone that people enjoy watching. || I think that people who do enjoy my stand-up comedy and the people who get it and the people who are taken in by it, they see that I'm a guy that has love of the game. || I invite her back to my apartment, or as I call it, the ""Death Star."" I'm still working on it, it's not completely operational. || When you're on a movie set and you are hopefully making a comedy, everyone's stifling their laughter. You're looking at the crew guys, hoping someone is making that face like, and not like, this is not working out, man. || Created a word game to play with a person you're fighting with. Silent Treatment. Nothing happens until one of you quietly says, ""Hey, you hungry?"" || It's hard dealing with day to day disappointments and feeling like you can't find success. Especially when your best friend is Pixar. || I don't care if you laughed at that or not, the next time you hear that shit, you're gonna be like, ""Haha. That Dane Cook is a silly bitch!"" || I would still have old ladies come up to me after the show and pat me on the cheek after I had said all this vulgar stuff. They would be like, 'Oh you're a silly boy - we know you're just playing.' || One night after a show he gave me a gift. When I opened up the bag, he had made out of clay and dried macaroni a model of the universe with the planets and everything. Then in the middle of the model was an action figure with my face on it. I was the center of his universe. || Three weeks ago one of my dreams came true. I finally got to see something I always wanted to witness live. I finally saw someone get hit by a car... Nailed! || It was peace. Peace is when you would shake the hands of the people around you. And you knew peace was coming because the priest would say it five times rapid fire. He'd go, ""My peace I leave, my peace I give to you. While we ate Reese's Pieces with the Lord. And I have a piece of lint in my peaceful eye!"" || I believe in people getting what's coming to them but don't hold grudges either. We all hurt people, fail and hopefully grow from adversity. Basically, eat shit and thrive. || I'm always going to be someone that people enjoy watching. || I don't laugh out loud at comics a lot. || It's an incredible feeling falling in love someone who doesn't know you exist. || I've been ignoring my feelings lately. That works pretty well. Might also settle for less this week, just to try it out. || No one wants to drown. Drowning would be the worst. Cause everyone knows that feeling. That feeling, oh it's the worst... when you think you're drowning. || You must accept responsibility for your actions. This doesn't include reactions, interactions or transactions if you're thinkin' loophole. || When I'm wrong I'm like the Emperor on the Death Star thinking he'll turn Luke. Yet, when I'm right I'm a Jedi like my father before me. || I don't hate anyone. I simply block them out using hellish visions in a blind white rage. But if I see them out I'm pleasant. || I never leave a dog alone in a car on a hot day. I make sure it's with an elderly person holding a baby. || I have a new saying, what I see in Vegas, I am telling everybody. || If somebody calls and messes with you on the phone like that you don't become terrified, you mess back. If somebody calls and was like ""have you checked the children?"" I'd be like ""I killed them!"" || How do you fall into a lion's den, that is my first question there, you think you would be extra carefull around a den of lions. || It really drives me banana sangwich. || I don't know if I could kill someone with a frozen turkey because that is a lot of evidence to eat. Unless I found a whole room of people who also wanted that person dead. || We always have creepy people around, a creepy individual, and it starts off when we're young-uns; when we're young-uns there's a creepy person. Back in school, back in the day, which by the way, I don't know if you knew this, was a Wednesday. Thats a little fun fact. Yeah, when you refer to ""back in the day"" it's a Wednesday. Take that home, chew it, it's delicious. || When you swear to God, its true. Right now God is watching and saying, ""this is true."" || So it's dark and the movie already started. And that first part of the movie is always some fucking cave scene and you're just like, ""Can they just flashback to a beach scene for like ten god damn seconds?"" || And you know that family, every few months, for years, from time to time, whatever it is they're doing they would just stop, stop and look at each other and go... what the fuck did they take? || I'm really great in other peoples relationships. || Here's when you know it's really really bad, when even the hookers in Grand Theft Auto ignore your car and walk away. The hookers in the game, then you have to follow them into an alley way, smash them with a mail box and steal their floating money. That's all I do when I play Grand Theft Auto, I don't even do the missions, I kill hookers and steal that sack of floating money. What if you could go somewhere, kill a hooker and her money could just float. You don't even need to pick it up you just walk through it and your body absorbs it. Playing that game, I thought it was like watching a documentary. Very similar to life, do this you wanna try it? Shoot a cop in the face, when all the back-up comes and tries to find you, just like in the game, hide behind a dumpster for 35 seconds, they'll call off the whole god damn search. || I'm bringing back the skinny tie but wearing it tied around my balls. || When you walk into the public restroom, why is everything fucking wet? || You're with someone for like 2 weeks in and you're like, ""Fuck, no way. I can't stand this person. I'll stay around for 5-6 years and we can end this thing violently, I got time. || You never make secret hallways normal height, they always have to be uncomfortable. Like Why the fuck did I build them like this?! Where's my Lab!?! || One thing that I've always wanted to do ever since I was little. I've always want to be abducted by a UFO. Yeah, sometimes I just go hang out in the woods. I'm just waiting for that blue light... ""Ahh!"" That's how they suck you up by a beam of light, they suck you up by your chest, and that's not necessary. Throw a rope ladder down, I'll climb up, I'm interested. I'm here for you. Don't suck me up by my chest, that hurts. You're a hovering craft, why wouldn't I come in and poke around for a minute? It would be great to be abducted. What did you guy's do this weekend? ""Dude, we got hammered, it was awesome."" Ohh yeah? I was abducted. I was zipping around the galaxy. || Now let's fight for three days because I'm bored! || You have the honesty of Abraham Lincoln and all the charm of the man who shot him. || I saw a young boy eating an ice cream cone. I smashed it in his face. You know that kid is going to remember me when he's 50. || Vince Vaughn is a genuine person, awesome guy. He'll come to a lot of my shows. It's not that often that you can meet someone as cool as Vince. || There's always someone in every group of friends that nobody likes. || I'm interested in doing everything and anything that I can to squeeze that creativity out of my brain. I guess I'm sort of a performance rat. || I can always get better. A lot of my ex-girlfriends don't think I'm funny. || We all hope for breakthrough rebirth moments. || If you use tact you can say anything, then make it funny. || Anger has a way of seeping into every other emotion and planting itself in there. || I want to be an alien. The movie 'Aliens' - isn't that the best, those aliens? You don't mess with those aliens. They're bad-ass looking. They're always wet and shit. You don't mess with that. If I got on the subway like that, you wouldn't mess with me. || ""You told your mother I was gonna blow you up with a fucking pumpkin bomb? What did she say?"" ""She. Was. Terrified. She wants me to move home."" || I'm quitting the business today. I'm going to open up an appliance store, I've always really been into toasters. I'm giving it all up. || What am I supposed to say to an atheist when he sneezes, ah, when you die nothing happens. || She'll take 3-5 steps, always 3-5 then she'll turn and just over her shoulder say, ""well your dumb like your father."" || You know what's so weird, why does this happen? This is a weird thing... phenomena. Alright. Sometimes guys, you're having sex right, and everything's going great, everything's, you know, NEAUNNNNEEEEEAAAUUU, right? When all of a sudden, there's a voice that comes into our brains and starts telling us to say shit. Like, ""Yeah, say that, say that, it's perfect. Say that right now,"" right? So you're like, ""Yeah, fucking say that,"" and you just grab her hair and you whisper, ""Eeeyeaa,"" and you don't think about it, you just say it . ""Yeaaah, fucking say things. You hear what I say? You like that, huh?"" || I had that game Operation. Big naked white guy... He had no pee pee at all. He was like that guy from the movie Silence of the Lambs remember he tucked it in... ""Put the lotion in the basket..."" I use to do it I'd come out of my girlfriend's bathroom and go look I'm just like you! I was always afraid that one time she'd be like ""Oh yeah! I'm just like you!"" || There's certain ways when people they bit it and they show it on the news, you laugh. Like who gets killed by Bees? every time they come on the news, ""Ahh a man was in Austin, killed by Bees"". I just fucking laugh! How do you get killed by Bees? If your walking through the woods right... And you come to a bush and you hear Bzz just you know run away from that bush! Who's going near that bush going ""Hey! Is that Bees? ... Ahh!"" Dude fuck that I would punch every Bee in the face! Bees are not taking me out! Yeah fuck you Bee! It's a fucking Bee! I could understand if it was like killer Horses! That's scary shit! Flying through the air kicking you in the face! That's scary, fuck Bees! || I'm dating a younger sexier crowd. || Hi, I'm a buck tooth and I like to be outside past the lips. || I think the word raped gets thrown around far too casually. You ever listen to a bunch of guys playing video games with each other online? It's like, 'Ah man you shot me in the back dude. You raped me dude!' I'm pretty sure if I talked to a woman who's been through that horrific situation and I said, 'What was it like, you know, being raped?' she's not gonna look at me and go, 'Have you ever played Halo?' || I never throw parties. Ya know why? Because afterward you always walk around going ""What the fuck did they take? Where’s my mom?"" || You're what we call a 2 bagger, ok, that means that I have to wear a bag on my head just in case the one on yours breaks. || I'm going to hell, ah... but you're laughing, so you're coming. || I like the mocha cappuccino orgasm myself. || When you don't have love, it is like there's a party going on and everybody was invited except for you... and you just happen to walk by that house in the rain. || The reason I like to watch stuff about the Civil War is because I believe that I was in the Civil War. I went to a clairvoyant and she told me in a past life, she goes ""You were in the Civil War."" And I said I feel this. Because when I watch programs about the Civil War, sometimes, I feel like I know people. I'm like ""There's James!"" ""Lloyd! I would know you, you fangle-tooth motherfucker! Go build that railroad."" || I was being chased by a giant crab. That's not funny. || It's not for any purpose such as religion, health, or things like that, I just never felt I had the need or want to drink or do drugs. || Then it was snack time, right in the middle of mass. Right out of nowhere, the priest would look down and say, 'Let's have some yum yums!' You would get in line - you would jump in the line - and you would go up and get the crouton O'Christ. || I've always wanted to uppercut a punkass and send him flying onto a table, preferably with a cake or a bowl of punch on it. || Someone needs to make a zombie movie where when you get bit it turns you into a singing and dancing extraordinaire. || Trolls look for reasons to hate but really what they are mad at is the fact they are not included in anything ever. || I live my life like there's no yesterday. || Some people give you that motivation to work harder simply to get the hell away from wherever they are. || If you’re drunk please don’t drive. If you’re on shrooms please don’t think Walmart’s a prison for bad clothing that needs help escaping. || You can’t become tempted if you just give in a little quicker. || I love singing along to the radio while I’m riding in the back of a squad car. || Wouldn't it be awesome just to come home and know that somewhere in your place there's a monkey you're gonna battle?I hate it when somebody turns around in my driveway. You're just sitting comfortably, watching T, you hear a car pulling up. Like, ""Who is this?!"" It's so disruptive. You look out: strange car, you don't know if it's a government official. You start getting concerned ""What, I don't know this car!"" Then they turn to leave. You're like, ""You son of a bitch! You wasted moments of my life! Moments I will never get back!"" || Sometimes sex is just a way to escape having to talk to that person. || Sometimes I like a dancing plethora of cheese in my mouth, and then other times I am into a more solo cheese adventure, just a single one on one, me and one cheese. || Here’s another way to be remembered, and this one, this is more personal. It’s more for you because nobody is ever going to know that it was you, but you’ll know, and that’s all that matters. Next time you go to a party, a great big party, go into the room where all the coats are: Shit on the coats. Guaranteed, at some point somebody’s gonna walk out of that room and go, ""Someone shit on the coats!"" || When we were kids movies were scary. They affected your brain for years. I saw ""Jaws"" I couldn't take a fuckin' bath for like 10 years. I thought that shark was coming out of the drain... I'm lathering one side at a time. || I have never even had a sip of alcohol, never have done drugs. The hardest thing I have ever done would be Pepsi. || Listening to Evanescence makes me want to break up with a girl in real time as a giant antique hourglass falls to the floor in slow motion. || I’m making a porno film today. Well, kinda. There’s no sex or people in it. It’s mainly time lapse video of landscapes eroding over time. || A lot of comics are kind of vampire types; we do our shows and disappear into the night. My philosophy was, this is like politics, and if I want people to know about my campaign, I'm going to go out there and shake hands. || Has anyone here ever been fully engulfed in fire? It's gotta be so hot! || I won't take no for a question. || I'm fine, I am just going to go over here and puke shards of my own pelvis into this bush. || Saw a lost dog sign with a pic of the dog and a little boy hugging it. I'm assuming the kids safe and we're just focusing on the pooch. || You know you're lazy when you run out of toilet paper and use the cardboard roll to wipe with. || On the wall someone always has to write, “Mike was here” but someone draws an arrow and writes ""Mike is a faggot."" Like Mike is coming back to check it out. ""What the fuck is this? I was here but not as a faggot! I’m trying to make a statement here!"" || I could take my time, and nobody was pressuring me to be a headliner. I could go up there, find my voice, and figure out what I wanted to do. || It was a personal achievement of mine to get on David Letterman. When I got there, I knew things were really happening for me. || We all hope for breakthrough rebirth moments. || I would love to have acidy spit. || Has anyone seen my shoes? I kicked them off in a fit of joy. || I have new ideas every day, and I always want to take on new challenges. || My professional dreams were coming true while I was living a personal nightmare. || You need to open up your soul and have a weep-a-thon. || Are there glass shards in my anus? || My grandmother died of natural causes. Or as my family calls it murdered by the lord. || You know when someone calls you 'pal' and you're not pals? Yeah, fuck that. || I don't say, ""Bless you."" I say, ""God bless you,"" because I'm not the Lord. || I’m not giving up on life. I’m giving up on today. || Dear semi hot girl taking photos on a boat. It's not your boat so stop acting like you own it. You drive a used Civic. || I can smell bullshit from a mile away but it's so much harder to detect when it's around you all day. || I don't have to do anything for anyone else's benefit anymore. I just want to exceed my own expectations. || Get a toilet.. when you flush it says ""Thanks for shitting me.. I enjoyed your shit"" || Let's talk a little about love. Sometimes you meet somebody and you have what is known as a relationship and things can go great. If things go great you have a great relationship. Sometimes it doesn't go so great and I call that a relationshit! || I'm in a new club, by the way. And I don't know if you're first timers like I am, but I'm in the 'I Just Dropped My Cell Phone In My Own Piss' Club. Have you done that? Yeah, good times. I'm on the phone and I forget that I'm using shoulder technique. Urinals were taken so I went in to use the regular john. And as I'm standing there, mid-conversation, I'm like 'Are you serious?' and it just started to toboggan right down my powerful chest. || Some people have constipation of the brain but their mouth has the runs. || Life is too short to waste your time, energy and love on a fucking asshole. || I miss dating only for that final moment you kiss goodnight, watch her get out of your car and run into the police station. || Video games don’t make people go nuts. I played Super Mario forever. Not once hopping on a turtle or smash my head through a brick ceiling. || When a guy says ""I have no idea what you're talking about"" it means ""I'm thinking of exactly what you're saying I did while I lie to you."" || I can't watch a woman play with herself - to me, it looks like a DJ working the turntables... DJ Diddles. || They always want head. We love it. We always have to watch, right? Right, if you have a lot of hair we fucking turn into Vidal Sassoon all of a sudden. We got like scrunchies and banana clips coming out of nowhere. Hairspray. ""Good. Good. Good."" Front row seats. ""I like that with the lips, the thing you're doing with the lips is good."" || I'm willing to write a check for $10,000 if someone can bring to me what I fell is ruining thousands of lives, destroying lives everyday. And I know that you know it's a little thing called Chupacabra. || We never had a pool, right. So one summer, I remember. My dad, to make me happy. You know I was bummed out cause we didn't have the pool. So one summer he bought us this thing. It was yellow, you laid it on the lawn, sprayed it with the water, run across. Slip n' Slide. Yeah. Would have been fun if dad checked for rocks before he laid it down! Slip n' Bleed from the anus they should have called this ride. || My favorite sexual position is when the girl is facing Mecca and I am fighting off a wolf. || People at home, you having some drinks? Having some drinkies? Or are you booting black tar heroin? Lose the habit! || You know what you were doing while the priest was doing his little peace rap? You were looking around for the people whose hands you were not going to shake. This was church, and you're like, 'No, fuck that guy.' || You can easily tell if a person is lying and cheating on you if they say, I love you. I would never lie to you or cheat on you. || Strip clubs are great places to meet interesting people you only wanna know for about 40 minutes. || I saw this on CNN a few days ago. In New York these cops freaked out. They shot at this guy 15 times 'cause they thought he was holding a grenade. He was eating a pear! How do you fuck that up?! Unless he was eating it like ""Ahhhhh! That's a delicious pear!"" || Any guy that refers to dating women as ""the hunt"" or being ""on the prowl"" should be evaluated for a number of conditions. || It's the greatest when your girlfriend says to you, ""dude... you need to go and get laid."" || Nothing is a better icebreaker than a great joke. || My nickname for my mom was 'The Compass.' || We're all gonna lie, we're all gonna cry, and we're all gonna take painful shits. || Just go to an airport, stand in front of a person who is waiting for their flight, and stare at them until they notice you are there. When they look at you, just say ""Don't get on the flight"" and walk away. You know they're sitting there going ""I don’t think I should get on this fucking flight.. I think an angel just told me not to get on this flight.. Thank you angel wearing jeans!"" || We should just have an orgy right here, right now. Let's just fucking turn off the lights and everybody just feel around. Le's just turn off the lights and play a game called Who's In My Mouth? Did you just say, ""careful?"" What are you, like my lifeguard? ""Careful! Careful, Dane! What, are you spotting my jokes? Careful... careful..."" || Nice teeth is a turn on for me. If you open your mouth and it looks like a battle of epic proportions, I don't like it. || They used to beat me up after Sunday School, I used to get beat up... yeah, that's a nice little thank you from Jesus. || I am going to name a group of my kids after my favorite cartoons, I am going to name them after Transformers. || I just mixed a 5 hour energy drink with some sleepy time tea. Let's see who wins this battle. || It's easy to point the finger at someone else and place blame. Go head try it it's fun. Pick anyone and start blame placing the shit outta them. || If you have to be at work at 8, it's always like, 7:54. Just enough time to do nothing. To just lay there and go, ""I can't do anything! I can't even have an English muffin!"" || I had one job that was kind of cop-like. One summer I did security at a miniature golf course. Just standing out in the sun all day, ""Hey, hey, excuse me sir. Get your putter out of the whale's ass. Come on, this is a place of miniature business. This is not a playground even though it looks like a playground."" || Why do they call it the restroom? Is there anybody just resting in this room? || Girls that prevent other girls from getting laid - twat swatters. || You can try to steal the thunder all you want, it just reminds people I’m the lightning. You rumble in the distance. I light up the sky. || I think beating someone to death with a ukulele would just sound funny. || True love is when you’re cheating on a person but the thought of them still makes your eyes smile! || Sometimes the only solution is figuring out a bigger problem to focus on. || Drive, ego and cocksureness are all essential elements in terms of getting exactly what you want but losing everything you've got. || The problem with dating a model is they won’t go out with you if your cars color doesn’t match their outfit. || When you delete pictures of your ex off your phone, it feels lighter. || I was home educated but would skip my lessons to go hang out at school. || If you’re “willing to die” for a cause you should really find some other less potential death related interests. || I found someones passport on the ground tonight. Where do you sell these things? || I love the movies, I don't even call them the movies, I call them cinematic adventures. || I feel like the gods have certainly patted me on the head. || A couple of days back, I got into a car accident. Not my fault. Even if it’s not your fault, the other person gets out of their car and looks at you like it’s your fault: ""Why did you stop at a red light and let me hit you doing 80!"" || Comedy crowds - we always want to come out and ask you, 'How you feeling?' We always say that, 'By a round of applause, how do you feel?' Right? 'By a round of applause, how you feeling?' It's the only place in the world that you judge how you're feeling by a round of applause... There's never like a car accident, people all over the ground, people running over - 'Ma'am! Ma'am! By a round of applause, how do you feel? By a round of applause - she's not clapping!' || I think an invisible shit monster just dumped in my fridge but I can't figure out where the stank is coming from. || When somebody says ""I wouldn't change a thing"" they're thinking of something they would change. || Don't let's someone walk all over you unless you're into that kind of thing. || People that are “cautiously optimistic” are not interesting. I’d rather hang with someone who is “dangerously pessimistic.” || You know your gut instincts are spot on about a person when you can also detect a water source in the soil beneath them. || If you lie to a person at least tell someone else you’ve lied to the truth. It balances out your karma. || I’m a deep thinker when it comes to shallow no brainers. || If you take a negative, turn it inside out, it’s still a negative. You’re just revealing the ugly inside of negative so I say keep it as is. || I feel like people who don’t brag are trying to make you jealous by thinking they’re hiding something more even exciting. || If you’re dating someone that says they’ve “got their priorities in order” that’s code for, “I’m spiraling out of control.” || It’s the worst feeling when you come home alone late at night and think the stranger sitting on your couch is a pile of clothes. || Teach your kids to make deplorable choices and hopefully they’ll rebel and make the right ones. || If you live far away from a person you no longer want to date just let them know that they are ""geographically undesirable."" || I’m more of a glass empty kinda guy. I look at it as having more room for ice. || I can't relate to the idea of suicide. I guess I'm just one of those people that is always optimistic and upbeat. But one day, I sat down. I said 'You know what? Just to kind of purge myself, I want to see what its like to feel that low'. So I decided to write a suicide note. Yeah, just to kinda flush it out there and put it on a page. And I started to do this, and I had an epiphany. I'll share this with you: a suicide note that is written by somebody that is not suicidal is called an autobiography. I am on Chapter 58. || It’s amazing how dumb people can impress you with how much stupider they can be when they really assert themselves. || You can’t teach an old hater new truths. || It’s hard to be happy for someone when you know deep down they’d kill you if they had the chance. || You are the director of your own life story. Don’t cast idiots or people will walk out during your 2nd act. || I'm watching some television tonight. I'm watching The Discovery Channel. You know, this channel, you never ever plan on watching this. It just happens. You're flickin' around, all of a sudden - boom - you're watching a mole for an hour-and-a-half. || I saw this homeless guy and this homeless girl, and they were making out! At one point, this guy walked by and yelled, ""Get a box!"" || When you and your friends are just hanging out, you don't consider your buddies to have one specific style of comedy, you just like to shoot the shit, and whatever is funny works. And that's my mentality on stage. I don't care to be like ""I'm the performer. Sit, listen, and laugh."" I want it to feel like we're all just hanging out. And that's how I tell my stories. || I appreciate the fact that Obama is the 'tech President'. I kinda like that, isn't that kinda cool? You see him, he's on his Blackberry. I'm like 'Is he playing BrickBreaker right now?'. He does like YouTube updates. Doesn't that have to be cool? Like you log in to your Myspace in the middle of the night and 'Oh fuck, Obama's on'. You can write to him 'Obama, what are you doing?'. 'Oh, I just downloaded that video of the kid shooting himself in the nipple with the paintball gun. You gotta see that. And I'm working on some legislation too'. 'Oh, good stuff. Obama, you on Facebook?'. 'Na, I got poked by a zombie and the Secret Service took me outta there, so...'. || Every joke has its origin - the punching people in the face joke.

I’d be like, ""Well, he’s probably on fire."" || Sometimes sarcasm is just someone quietly hating the fuck outta you. || Text a guy you like right now, ""I'm thinking about you.""

And Obby didn't just smell like a hint of piss, he didn't smell like a smidgen of piss, that kid smelt like he was dipped in a vat of piss, like he woke up in the morning and said ""Woooo! Bring on the piss!"" and someone brought on the piss. I don't know who'd bring piss on but you can pretty much hire anyone on Google these days. Just type in ""piss painters"" or something I'm sure somebody will come over and coat you down with a sheet off piss for a reasonable price. || I don't like when juice wears tights, its a horrible combination when juice wears tights. || I was literally cheated on...I woke up and they were on top of me. || Who doesn't like movies?

But all of them have great senses of humor. || I'm glad that my parents missed one thing that was really unbelievable. They saw me hit this great success. It was a blast and we had a lot of laughs.

Being on the road while in relationships, you need to learn to pleasure one another. || Sometimes, like we all do, I look at myself in the mirror. Sometimes I cry. Like a really hard cry like you just watch yourself cry but then you're done and you're just glowing and you're staring at yourself. || My brother Darryl, he's the manager and I'm like this is going to be awesome because my bro, manager, is going to hook me up, he was a dick!

You mean, you're stupid. || If you have ever typed 'sorry not sorry' I hope you die... not sorry. || Saw myself naked in front of a mirror a couple days ago - that's not the joke, that's what we called the setup. I saw myself naked, and I said, 'Holy cow, I'm 'The White Man.' I've heard a lot of bad things about you, cracka.' || I came up with my own expression. I like to make it hail. Yeah. That's when you throw change on sluts. || I heart abortion. Where’s the shirt for that, urban outfitters?! And it won’t be a normal heart. It’ll be a dead infant heart. Y’know what the back will say? Problem Solved. || Even when I was a kid, my imaginary friend would play with the kid across the street. I'd be like, ""Hey, so I guess I'll see you later,"" and he's, like, ""Whatever, queer"". That's a hate crime! || I'm not saying I'm smarter than Steve Jobs was, but I would have made the iPhone charger cord twice as long. || In the long run the pessimist may be proved right, but the optimist has a better time on the trip. || They have a show on MTV that I can't stand, 'Cribs.' You ever watch 'Cribs'? Yeah, that show should be called, 'Wanna Feel Like a Failure?' || I’m not a good actor, I can play myself and a much gayer version of myself. That’s my range. || One day, I want to get rich enough so that every time I walk into a room I can release a dozen doves. || Much like Down Syndrome, red hair is a genetic mutation, and it occurs when a human has unprotected sex with a clown. || When you see a married couple walking down the street, the one that's a few steps ahead is the one that's mad. || I think we should legalize marijuana in this country… so potheads don’t have anything to talk about anymore. Grow up and do coke like an adult! || I’ll tell you what’s better than watching the sunrise… Sleeping through it. || Men are simple things. They can survive a whole weekend with only three things: beer, boxer shorts and batteries for the remote control. || You'll have to excuse me for my bad posture. My mom says it's 'cause I have a huge cock. Yeah, she talks like that. She's a sailor. We don't judge her. She lives by one rule, and it's the rule of the sea. || You know what really shuts up a bully? Learning how to build a pipe-bomb! || Go ahead, dumb people, be offended by a joke that doesn't have a plausible premise. || I have no problem with illegal immigration in this country, except for the fact that they don't serve on jury duty. That's horse shit. It should be the other way around - they should serve exclusively on jury duty. Then it finally would be a jury of one's own peers. It's not a stereotype if it's always true; then it becomes law. || Yes you can tell how good a guy is on bed by the way he dances. If a guy is excellent at dancing he’s also probably really great at having sex… with men… having anal sex. || Fifty Shades Of Grey proved you can write about a dude choking women and shoving stuff up their butts but heaven forbid if you tell a legitimate joke about it. Sure I doubled the number of feminists who hate me, but I also doubled the number of shows I have on TV. No regrets. || Perhaps your palate isn’t sophisticated enough to understand my brand of humor. || You never see anyone wearing a black turtleneck and leather jacket doing something nice. || Never trust anyone who buttons their top button. || I was drinking tea the other day, and I thought: they used to fight wars over this. || I have a five-gallon jar at my house I like to fill with change. I don't stop 'til I reach tip-top and that little bell goes off, and I know Cargo Pant Day is here at last, and I dance. And I put the cargo pants on with a belt - extra tight because I don't want to have an embarrassing situation on such a great day - and I fill up all the pockets with the change. Then I get a car alarm - not a car alarm with a car, just a car alarm - and I hold it to my chest really closely. And then I go walk around the streets of Manhattan, and I wait for the first homeless person to come up to me and say, 'Hey, you got any spare change?' Then, I set the car alarm off: 'You hit the jackpot, mofo!' || Let’s not pretend that anyone in here likes Nebraska. Have you ever wondered why theres storm chasers? An hour in Omaha and I’m looking for a tornado to take me any place. Get me the hell out of there, uh, no wonder there all fat it’s so they’ll stay on the ground. || The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...' || The nice thing about being a celebrity is that if you bore people they think it's their fault. || I'm a lousy piece of ass, and I should know every man i have been with has told me so, I've been there almost every time. I mean, the closest thing I got to a birds and bees talk was with my dad. He was like, ""Son, sex is a lot like this egg."" ""Dad, I think those are drugs."" ""Whatever, queer."" ""Why does everyone keep saying that?"" ""Listen up, son, listen good. You take a woman and crack her over the head and lie her flat. Make sure she sizzles and then flip her over. Don't stand too close or you'll get yellow stuff all over your bacon"" What? I see some of you holding your stomach and feeling: ""No, you shouldn't."" That's a breakfast joke. That's the most important joke of the day. If you don't laugh at that, you're gonna be sleepy around 11:30. And you'll be like, ""Why am I so tired?"" || Ben Roethlisberger is Tim Tebow minus Jesus. || I can say that. I have a television show. || Wrestling’s like Broadway for Hillbillies. It’s the third-favorite white-trash pastime behind incest and NASCAR. || “Money doesn’t buy happiness.” Uh, do you live in America? ‘Cause it buys a WaveRunner. Have you ever seen a sad person on a WaveRunner? Have you? Seriously, have you? Try to frown on a WaveRunner. You can’t! || If you had to eat another human to survive, do you think they'd taste like their ethnic background? || I asked her to record the game on ESPN, which she did, but not ESPN-HD. And then she says, 'Well, at least you still get to watch it.' Oh yeah, I pay extra money so I can watch TV like poor people. I don't even feel bad for cheating on you this weekend. || The only thing better than the world’s cutest cat is any dog. || If Canada were really that great, it would be a state. || A white lady came running up to me after a show. She goes, ""What gives you the right to do jokes about black people like that."" And I’m like, ""Listen lady, my best friend is Cuban. And that’s close enough."" || Until I was thirteen I thought my name was Shutup. || Cheaters never prosper, unless they get away with it. || Face down, ass up, that's the way we both got stuck. || Models: I'm not voting for you for any stupid magazine list! If you were really that Hot you wouldn't have to beg the world to stuff the ballot. || Am I getting smart with you? How would you know? || If you look at the Bible and you look at Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, we all know who sinned first. Ladies, do you have to eat everything? || Somebody bought me a Snuggie as a joke gift. Haha, the joke's on you, I enjoy it. I toss and turn at night, finally a blanket that's like, 'I'm going to keep you warm.' It's like having a small child with polio keep you in a full nelson - the perfect pressure. || Big can be beautiful - just not to me. I find you disgusting; freshmen 15 is not a life sentence. || No matter how flat you make your pancakes, it still has two sides. || I assume the only reason we have them is so that white people feel relevant in sports. Because other than that the only thing the winter Olympics show me is which country has more rich white kids. What's it cost to go skiing - $900 a day? I can't believe that's not more popular in the inner cities. || By the way, everything I say is wrong; I'm a complete hypocrite. I've dated girls with boob jobs, breast enlargements, but she was an A cup and that's gross. Get it fixed girls, you're not even a real woman. || God does not hate gay people. He's just mad because they found a loophole in His system. || I have voices in my head, but they're all speaking Spanish, and I have no idea what they're saying. || No touching… Cashmere is highly sensitive to the oil in poor people’s fingers. || Sometimes my mind wanders; other times it leaves completely. || I will shut down Instagram so girls can’t use filters into tricking us that they are that pretty; you’re eyes aren’t that blue, and you don’t glow. || I will not date a woman from China, because that is a big red flag. || Maybe everyone doesn't deserve a second chance. If I can be perfect why can't you? || I always wondered if those WWJD bracelets worked, so I bought one the other day. Well, a few minutes later, I was on a plane and this little kid was kicking my seat repeatedly, while his sister sang along with her walkman and their mother just sat there. I almost turned around and went off, and then I caught sight of my bracelet. What would Jesus do? So I lit them on fire and sent them all to Hell. || I'm not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I'm not dumb... and I also know that I'm not blonde. || A lot of times people complain that their significant other takes too long to get ready to go out at night. I've never had that complaint and I think it's because I never want to go anywhere, so I could care less how long it takes her to get ready. That's just less time I have to spend with her horrible friends pretending I don't want to kill myself. She'll take an hour and a half to get ready, come down and be like, 'Oh my goodness, you were so patient.' And I'll be like, 'For what? You look disgusting.' Now she's crying, whatever, I bought myself an extra two hours to watch the game. It's not like she's going to break up with me; she's 10 years younger, she's one opinion away from being replaced. I can say that, I have a television show. || Yes, I am aware that I am the gayer version of Jeff Lewis. || In Los Angeles they don't throw out their garbage away. They make it into television shows. || Men who don't understand women fall into two groups: Bachelors and Husbands. || My act is very educational. I heard a man leaving the other night saying, Well that taught me a lesson. || This is what I say to the most conservative person that's so terrified of gay marriage becoming legal. Just because the state says it's legal, it's not like God's going to let them into Heaven. So you can still sleep sound every night knowing that goal line defense is up at the pearly gates. || It's not Spring Break until somebody dies! || I’ve never cheated on a girl. I haven’t. I’m faithful. If I don’t want to be in a relationship I’m honest, upfront, and I get out of the relationship. Naw, I’m kidding. I throw that dick everywhere! || A gynecologist is the dentist for the downstairs mouth. || Women can do anything men can do… except math, chess, running, jumping, lifting stuff, fixing things, making money, hockey, surfing, driving, making decisions, being tall, taking out the garbage, tipping, fishing, being funny on purpose, reading a map, listening to good bands, writing, running the country, inventing anything important, or being fun to hang out with. Don’t get me wrong, I love women, I just think they should drink from a separate water fountain. || Kangoroos can't hop backwards. || No one dies a virgin, Life screws us all. || There is nothing so annoying as having two people talking when you're busy interrupting. || Real patriotism is realizing America sucks, but everywhere else is a thousand times worse. || Don’t blame your failure on haters. If everyone thinks you suck, they’re not haters. They’re right. || I never got a birds and the bees speech as a child. The closest thing I ever got - one time, my dad was cooking breakfast; he's like, 'Sex is a lot like this egg. First thing you gotta do is heat up the bed real nice, get it nice and warm, get it ready for her. Then, you gotta take her, crack her over the head and lay her out flat, alright? Come on now - wait 'til she starts sizzlin' really good, then you can flip her on over - there ya go. Don't get too excited or you get yellow stuff all over the bacon.' || If you like soccer, then welcome to America. See, our country already has entertainment so watching people chase a ball for four hours to end 0 - 0 is not enjoyable - unless, of course, the bleachers collapse and half of Europe dies. || If you support the second amendment, then let me exercise my support of our first amendment: you’re a fucking idiot. Do you even know what the third amendment is? The right to kick soldiers out of your house when the Revolutionary War is over. || I hate you, Google. You've caused a lot of problems in my relationship. I share a computer with my girlfriend and she would look up anything. ""I'm going to look up apples today."" She just hits 'A.' It's ""Asian ass porn"" instantly. Google is, like, ""I'll take it from here. I know exactly what you're looking up... Well, every time you hit 'A,' it's 'Asian ass porn.'"" Google! All I ask is that you let her type three letters before you jump to such a bold conclusion. It's bad enough that I'm clearing my history every three hours and changing my passwords. I'm trying to have an honest relationship, and you are fucking my shit up! || How come everybody cheers when chicks flash their T&A, but when I pull out my D&Bs, i'm a registered sex offender. || Do you love 'Trading Spaces'? I do. I would never be on that show, though. You want to know why? 'Cause you have to trust your friends to decorate your house. You have not met my friends. They do not have my best interests at heart. 'Cause it's always some over-the-top, eccentric interior designer coming in, going, 'Oh my goodness, I love this place. This is what I'm thinking for your friend's house: circus tent. Big circus tent! Do you think your friend would like a circus tent?' 'Oh yeah, he'd love a circus tent. No, no no no, yeah. Why don't you go dig up the hardwood floors, get down to the dirt, that way the ponies will feel at home.' 'Great. We're under budget.' || Does everybody have their WWJD bracelets on? 'Cause I was wearing my bracelet recently, and I was in the movie theater, and this guy's cell phone went off - don't you just hate that? Then he picked it up, 'Hey, how's it going? I'm in a movie.' And I'm like, 'Hey! Get off the phone!' And he's like, 'Mind your own business.' And I almost went crazy, but then I looked at my bracelet: what would Jesus do? So I lit him on fire and sent him to Hell. || It’s not that hard to climb a pole. All you need are powerful thighs and an empty soul. || I do think we can be a little less PC when it comes to sports, though. Just once I want to hear an announcer go ‘God, black people are fast. Holy cow! All of them. They’re fast. Back to you Bob.’ || Am I the only person who blames global warming entirely on the Amish? Are they not a constant reminder of how awful life would be without all this great technology? Every time I want to cut back and conserve on natural resources, I just look at the Amish and I'm like, 'Fuck that.' || Anal sex is a lot like spinach: if you're forced to have it as a child, you won't enjoy it as an adult. || It's not a stereotype if it's always true. || Every year on my birthday I get a small dash on my inner thigh where my balls currently hang. You can't tell me that's not going to be a beautiful work of art when it's finished. My grandkids are playing with my balls, they can't figure it out. They're like, 'What are these things?' I'm like, 'It's your future, read the chart.' They don't stop growing; they're like earlobes. That joke was inspired by a door that wasn't locked when I was 11. || I think boxers are the greatest athletes in all sports for the simple fact that they don't cry. That is mind-blowing. Have you ever been punched in the nose? Oh my gosh, it hurts so bad. They have to go back to corner, where some little man yells at them. 'Shut up, I just got punched in the face!'... If I was a boxer, do you know who I would hire as my corner man? My mom. || I don’t believe space exists. You’re not gonna put a camera on a roomba, stick it in the desert, and tell me it’s Mars. || You know why they say that, that models are too skinny? Because parents are horrible, they can’t tell their sixteen year old daughter she’s not really a princess, well guess what, I can. || Honest criticism is hard to take, particularly from a relative, a friend, an acquaintance, or a stranger. || I'd like a game show with millionaires on it, and they have to play with their own money, and they can't win money, they can only lose 'til one them goes complete broke, and the show's called 'Ha Ha, Now You're Poor.' || Pepper spray is a woman’s go-to weapon of choice, it even comes in different strengths in case you’re only semi-serious about not getting raped. If you were truly nervous about your safety, you’d carry a gun, not a spice. Bullets travel a lot faster than mist. What predator’s gonna wait while you rummage through your purse to find a tube of Tabasco sauce? You can’t even find your phone in there when it’s ringing and vibrating. Nothing’s more embarrassing than being the girl who always has pepper spray but never has to use it. May as well leave your weapons at home cause the cat knitted on your sweater does the job just fine. || I feel bad sometimes because I secretly hope New Orleans gets nailed again. || People always say I couldn’t live in California cause they love seasons too much, yeah I do too that’s why I live in a place that skips the shitty ones. || You ever hear girls say that? ""I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual."" I like to reply with ""I'm not honest, but you're interesting!"" || I don't think I could stab somebody, 'cause I'm really bad at a Capri Sun. || Some say the glass is half empty, some say the glass is half full, I say, are you going to drink that? || ""There’s no excuse for domestic violence."" It sounds like a challenge. I mean, does everything have to be so black-and-white in this kindergarten country of ours? What if you come home from a long day at work and your wife has drowned two of your kids - she’s about to dunk the third one. Can you run over and pop her then? ""Unfortunately no, there’s no excuse. You’re going to have to let her drown that third one."" || Technically it's not premarital sex if you don’t plan on marrying them. || My favorite thing to steal is a kiss. You can get arrested for it but they can’t force you to give it back. || Thank you people that are laughing with your hand away from your mouth. That joke is clearly not for everyone, but I enjoy watching people that don’t laugh make the people that do laugh feel shitty about themselves. || Sure I may look adjusted, but I can’t function in normal society because most of you are too stupid. || Every video from Russia is depressing, it’s like they have their cameras set to sad. || Feminists think that this show is only for sexist dudes, but in fact 43% of our viewers are sexist females. || Never hit a woman unless you are a bigger woman. || Scattergories is second base for Christians. || I didn’t have a priviledged childhood like a lot of you. I grew up on a public golf course and that’s embarrassing. I lived on the right side of the fairway. All these hacks slicing into your yard. You don’t hear “Fore!” while you’re mowing. “Nothing runs like a Deere.” ‘Til a Titleist is lodged in your carburator. || It’s all fun and games until someone gets a boner. || The worst television is MTV. 'Music Television' - they call it that, they don't even play music. How's that legal? What if everybody did that? 'Hey, thanks for calling New York Pizza.' 'Yeah, give me two large pepperoni pizzas.' 'Oh, we don't sell pizza.' 'What?' 'No, we just have raccoon hats and eye patches. Call a book store if you're hungry.' || I don’t know what popping-and-locking is but I know to lock my car door whenever people are doing it. || Of course money buys happiness. You ever seen a homeless person skip? The answer to that riddle’s no. They’re not allowed. || I hate the idea of owning a gun, but I love the idea of owning a cannon. || Germany’s like Wisconsin, but with, like, a really bad past. || Being a white boxer is like being a republican. No matter how hard you work, you’ll always lose because of the Mexicans. || You ever hear this expression? The worst day of fishing is better than the best day at work. Uh, I'll call B.S. I've watched the deadliest catch on Discovery. I've never once been at work, capsized in a 40 degree water, watched all my co-workers die, and be like, ""Hey, at least we're fishin'."" || So when I get a phone call at the airport, I'll admit it, I like to have a little fun. 'Go ahead. Gate 47 is completely clear.' People notice in a hurry. 'Honey, something is going on. That guy has a wire hanging down, maybe we shouldn't be standing right here.' 'Stand down, blue team! Stand down, blue team!' 'Honey, there is a sting going down at the airport. I am not feeling safe. Please, let's move.' 'Stand down, down blue team! Don't - hold on, the subject's approaching. He's in a business suit with a briefcase. I repeat, the briefcase is in his hand.' And I find some random businessman. I run, and I just beat the crap out of him. And everybody starts clapping, 'Thank you for making our airways safe.' And then I go get on my plane, and that guy just has a weird story to tell for the rest of his life. || We owe it to our troops to let them sleep in their own beds, wake up in the morning, have a delicious breakfast, and drive to war. || Posting calorie counts on a menu is like a girl tattooing the number of STDs she has on her vagina. Everyone close enough to read those stats is already committed to that bad decision. || Am I the only person who hopes that David Beckham has sex with Brad Pitt? I don't know who's in charge of casting in Hollywood, but make it happen before one of them is out of their prime. Can you imagine those two men together making love? If there's a man in here that's junk doesn't wiggle just a little bit at the thought of those two men together - this has nothing to do with your homophobic sexual preference. At that level it's art, you monkey. You should be honored that you share the same restroom with those Greek gods. || Eating fast food is like murdering hitchhikers. As long as you only do it every once in a while, it will never catch up with you. If the word “nugget” is anywhere on your menu, I won’t eat at your restaurant. For me, mcdonald’s is just an emergency bathroom in over 119 countries. A hamburger shouldn’t cost 99 cents. Eating right is expensive, but what you spend on organic food, you save on new underwear. || I didn’t have a priviledged childhood like a lot of you. I grew up on a public golf course and that’s embarrassing. I lived on the right side of the fairway. All these hacks slicing into your yard. You don’t hear “Fore!” while you’re mowing. “Nothing runs like a Deere.” ‘Til a Titleist is lodged in your carburator. || I like my women like I like my coffee. I don’t like coffee. || Eating fast food is like murdering hitchhikers. As long as you only do it every once in a while, it will never catch up with you. If the word “nugget” is anywhere on your menu, I won’t eat at your restaurant. For me, mcdonald’s is just an emergency bathroom in over 119 countries. A hamburger shouldn’t cost 99 cents. Eating right is expensive, but what you spend on organic food, you save on new underwear. || Have you heard about the morning after pill, or what I like to call breakfast in bed. Well have you heard about how some of the girls who have taken have died a few days later? Talk about two birds, looks like I will be going to the game this weekend boys."
Dat Phan,"Us Asians look like we’re twenty until we’re fifty. Once we’re fifty, we look like Yoda. || I knew comedy was for me when I was the only Asian in high school that failed math. But you know when I failed eight other students around me failed too. || And I come from a small Vietnamese family. We’re really close too, all ten of us. || I watch Japanese animation, right? My mom's like, 'Dat Phan, you cannot watch cartoon - it's too violent!' This is the same woman that goes, like, 'Dat Phan, if you don't take out the trash now, I will kill you!' || I was doing gigs to stay alive. I worked two or three jobs at a time, there were times when I stayed up for 36 hours straight. I slept in shopping mall parking lots. A stand-up gig paid $35; then I could eat for another few days until the next gig. Literally, I was performing to live. || I don't think my mom’s racist, but I think she's old fashioned, you know? And she doesn't know how to, like, talk about it with me. She's like, 'Dat Phan, you like the soup? Eat the soup. Right there. You like the soup? Why you date the white girl?' || I'm gonna come home with, like, five fake earrings on and be like, 'Mom, today I joined five gangs.' 'Huh! You also five times gay! Get out of house, fruit loop.' || Telling a comedian ""Make me laugh"" on their time off, is like telling a professional dancer: ""Strip for me, you cheap little whore"". || When you grow up poor, you have to either work really hard to try and get where you want to be, or you'll just stay put. || It's kind of funny how that happened. When I was a child, I had a dream of one day becoming very influential and being in the entertainment world. I really wanted badly for that to happen, and in the last couple of years, my manager told me I was nominated for the group of the Most Influential Vietnamese-American Individuals in the world, along with generals and ambassadors and surgeons. It's an honor. It's mind-boggling. I'm a college dropout; I'm a high school failure, someone who came from a homeless background, but I understand the American pop culture and doing comedy from my heart led me to be in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. || Vietnam, we take over by doing pedicure! That's how we take over. We take over one foot at a time, damn it - that's the plan of attack right there. We take over from the toe up, that's the plan. We spread over USA like fungus from the toe. || I learned that money's not happiness. The more famous I am and the more money I make, the closer I stay to my family and friends that I've known since junior high school. True happiness to me is the connection with fellow human beings I've known for a long time. || You can get to the next level if you're willing to give up everything and give everything you have in your heart to make it. || I did whatever it takes to do stand-up. There is an abundance of material in struggling and poverty and trying to make it. There is so much humor in that, it's unlimited. || I didn't do real well. I bombed. Something inside me told me to keep trying because I had nothing to lose. I gave it another shot, and I still bombed, but I got one laugh. And that laugh gave me encouragement to continue for the next seven years. || I try not to represent just Asians. Instead, I try to expose our culture to everyone through humor & performance; Hoping that we will be a part of each other and more so a part of everything in a positive light || It's a constant battle between what your heart tells you, and what your brain tells you. || We want to be seen as more than just martial artists, or bad stereotype token roles in American TV and movies. || My dad only said two things to me around the house, you know, when I was there. Number one: 'Ok, Ok, USA.' And two: 'Good. Good, Dat Phan.' How do you carry a conversation on with that? Like, 'Dad, how are you doing?' 'Ok.' Like, 'Dad, the house is on fire.' 'Ok.' || I was living under a desk in West Hollywood. It was a closet that I shared with another comic. I was shocked when they called me to come in to try out for the show. The chances of me getting on a TV show and winning it is like one-in-a-million. I had only been doing comedy for six years at that point, so I was basically considered an open mic-er or maybe a feature act once in awhile. || Money comes and goes. I'm thankful I have money. I'm trying to save up more. I would like more money. But it's not happiness. If you're a millionaire and hate your family, hate your friends and your life, then what is the point? You're just a person with a lot of money and power who is not happy. || My mom was so strict when I was a kid, she wouldn’t even let us watch The Brady Bunch. The Brady Bunch! She was like, ""That’s why you don’t watch The Brady Bunch, that show suck. Six kids, that’s nothing. That’s right, I have ten kids. Why don’t you watch me? No commercial here. No ads. I run the whole operation, Dat Phan, watch me."" || My poor mom, she's like, 'That's my son, Dat Phan. He crack joke all the time. I tell him go to law school, become a lawyer. But no, he move up to Hollywood - he live out of his car; he eat Top Ramen with all the gay guys.'"
Dave Attell,"Here's a tip: Never get drunk while wearing a hooded sweatshirt. You will eventually think there's someone right behind you. || Capital punishment, that thing scares me, it really does. I was talking to my friend about the electric chair, and he starts freakin' out. He's like 'the electric chair? That's too good for these people. That's too good for them'. Alright, how do we make the electric chair worse? How about this? They have to pedal a car battery to their own head. Is that ok? Is that enough, Mr. Hitler? || Being on the road is kind of lonely. || That was funny, yet sad. Kind of like getting tit-fucked by a clown. || I used to do drugs, but that was way back there. || I'm a joke comic. I tell jokes. || Doesn't matter what you say or do; people can always find a way to call you a dick. || I don't watch reality TV. I'm cool. || What do you do when you get caught masturbating? Well, here's a little tip. First, look surprised. And don't worry, you will be surprised. And then say this: ""Quick get some help! My hand and my penis are fighting!"" || I don't mind a crowd's not laughing; it's the groans that slow down the show. || I like doing stand-up and I love putting out TV specials. || Some people are against porno movies. And I say hey, Ohio, Kentucky, and Iran: I say, hey - whatever a man, and a woman, and another woman with a penis and a midget do to a donkey, that's their garsh-darn business. || I have no grand scheme. || I never wanted to be famous. || I have an imagination because my life is so boring that my imagination lets me get off the reality of what's going on. || I get recognized, but I'm not really a famous famous. || If that man's straight, then I am sober. || For a long time the people at my shows were sort of the Pantera-tattoo trucker guys, really cool dudes, but I don't know what happened to them. That's the crowd that I like, the ones that don't get so offended just to be offended. || A lot of these kids I think are more content just to be on Facebook and the computer than they are to actually go out. They just really want to get a picture to post to their buddies, and that's about it. || You know what my drink is? Jack Daniel's. Yes, that is a wild man drink. That should come with bail money, you know what I'm saying? Because on Jack, you don't know where you're going to end up, but you know when you get there, you won't be wearing any pants. || I'm a stand-up comic. Anything else I do besides that is a plus, but stand-up comedy is what I do, it's what I've been doing and it's what I'm going to keep doing. || Let's say you're in a situation where crystal meth can help you. Like, I don't know, you have too many teeth. || Never drink alone, that's what they say. But you know what? If you drink you will never be alone, alright? || Ever wrestle your dog 'til you cum? || I was on a date with this really hot model. Well, it wasn't really a date date. We just ate dinner and saw a movie. Then the plane landed. || I like writing a joke, and I like when a joke works, and I like other comics who tell jokes. || I hang out with my dad mostly, my dad was in the military. He's at that age now where his war stories and other stories have blended together, so now you don't know what he's talking about. ""One time, we were surrounded, then we ran out of ammo, then we were fighting hand-to-hand, then we started dancing, and that's how I met your mother."" || I smoke so much. Three packs a day... I went to the bathroom, a camel came out of my ass. || And everything's over when your grandma walks in, get that dick outta the fish tank! Time for supper! || Things have been invented because of alcohol. Like the taser, okay? Yeah! The morning after pill, okay? The reach-around. Judge Judy. What has pot given the world? Hackey sack? Yeah! Hilarious ring tones? Oh gah! Ultimate Frisbee Championships? It sucks to be a champion at a sport that can't get you laid. I''s an unneeded skill like, I dunno, being the best banjo player. Or a squirter. || I went to see the shuttle go up. There was nobody there; I was the only guy there. Everybody was at NASCAR. Who's your favorite astronaut? If you could only fuck one astronaut, who would it be? Mission specialist Blabadahdah? But NASCAR, now that's something different. 'Cuz goin' to outer space - that's for nerds. But driving quickly in a circle... hmm, who isn't wet? || Your parents want you to go to college because while you're away at college, they're fucking on your bed. || Everything you do, burns calories. Getting up in the morning, 100 calories; kicking the hooker out of your bed, another 100; diapering your monkey, 35 calories; laughing at a midget, fun and 10 calories; catching your girlfriend with another guy, 2000-3000 calories, depending on backswings. || I was in the scouts and we had to learn survival things. Like snakebite, what do you do? Suck out the poison. But with your right hand, jiggle the man's balls. That's how I was taught. || I have a lot of pot tendencies. I'm always late, I laugh for no reason, I watch ""Jeopardy!"" with the sound off and make up my own questions. || Some things are the same wherever you go, like if it feels like more than two fingers, it's probably a dick. || It's because of men like you that women like that fuck guys like me. || You know that kind of drunk where you're a drink away from yelling faggot or being one. || I have soundtracks for a lot of stuff. || I don't think I'm a star or a celebrity or any thing like that. || You know, men and women are a lot alike in certain situations. Like when they're both on fire - they're exactly alike. || I tell you one thing that's great about children. They don't need a show to have fun. What do they need? A book of matches, some oily rags, a little brother… that's all they need. || I love Fear Factor, but I think they're running out of fears. It's only a matter of time before they're sitting around doing shots of Hepatitis C. || Man, you've gone from social drinker to alcoholic really quickly. || My cousin had a baby and I was watching her breastfeed for a couple of bucks, and I'll tell you ladies: it's amazing. || I watch the Discovery Channel, and you know what I discovered–I need a girlfriend. ‘Cause that Discovery Channel is the most boring shit I’ve ever seen in my life, and the more of it you watch, the less chance you ever have of meeting a woman, cause it fills your head full of odd facts that come out at any moment like Tourette’s Syndrome. I’m talking to a girl: “hi, how ya doin’. Did you know Hitler was ticklish? Much like the sea otter. Where are you going? Come back!” || I feel like soundtrack music is almost like seeing the movie again, but with my ears. || Next time your lady leaves the room, take a dump on the floor! 'Cuz there is nothing more mysterious than a dump on the floor! And it always starts a conversation, am I right? Honey, what happened? You better hold me 'cause I'm afraid. || The sun comes up and so does your dick. Cause at heart your dick's a farmer! || I've never had a surprise birthday party. I've had every other type of surprise. I've had surprise beatings, surprise drug tests, surprise daughter I think. || Remember when you're young and you think your dad is Superman? And then you grow up and realized he's just a drunk who wears a cape. || There's a late-night scene in every town, and everyone has something going on. I've heard good stories about Syracuse; this is a very good party town, a good drinking place. I definitely would like to come back and check it out further. Do some more research, as I call it. || Once you get offstage you're just like everyone else, and everyone else can get into a fight. || Every man wonders about the size of their penis. Laying in bed alone at night, or in a hammock with a parrot. You start thinking, ""Do I have a small penis or just gigantic balls?"" || You should’ve hung out, man. || Sparklers are the gay cousins of the fireworks family. I think a flashlight is more dangerous than a sparkler. My friends got M-80s, bottle rockets, ammonium nitrate, manure, a rented van. They're blowing shit up, getting things done. I'm walking around with a sparkler like the Special Olympics torch-boy. || Is she crazy, like it says on her bracelet, or is she just looking at my sheets? I dunno! || My day jobs... I knew I was bad at those, so I didn't really have the confidence to think that I could do comedy. But I knew I hated the day jobs. || One time my own father caught me watching a porno movie. The one thing you never wanna hear in that situation is, ""son, move over."" ""And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon…"" my eye! || There's a fine line between masturbating while you look out a window, and masturbating while you’re looking in a window. I'll give you a hint: one of 'em is super illegal. || I went to Dayton, Ohio, recently. Know what's a fun thing to do there? Pack up and get the fuck out, that's what. || Sometimes whiskey dick is a good thing, like last night fucking the left eye of a pumpkin sounded like a good idea... thank you whiskey dick thank you! || If you see a man running down the street cock-flapping, you run with that man. 'Cause there is some scary shit coming the other way. || Aspirin will not bring dead hookers back to life. || I think pot should be legal, I do. I also think if your cousin is super-hot, you should be able to fuck one time. || Tattoos are cool because they don't belong on your body, but you put it there to say something about yourself. Much like my rolls of fat. That shit does not belong on a human body. And I put it there to say something about me. I don't like fruit. I don't like it! Long bike ride? I'm out. Hot dog eating contest? I'm listening. || I gotta quit smoking, doctor's orders, and the drinking, court orders. || There's a fine line between cuddling and holding someone down so they can't get away. || So, I travel a lot. I hate traveling, mostly cause my dad used to beat me with a globe. || I'm not really a music guy. || I'm not like a performer type. || I'm not a movie guy, I'm not a TV sitcom guy, but whatever seems to fit and is funny is good for me. || You can say, ‘Can I use your bathroom?’ and nobody cares. But if you ask, ‘Can I use the plop-plop machine?’ it always breaks the conversation. || Friends are important, dontcha think? Hmmm? I think so. The way I see it, you got friends, and you got your best friend, big difference. To me, a friend's a guy who will help you move. A best friend's a guy who will help you move a body. That's how I look at it. || If these walls could talk... you'd hear the sound of fat women saying, ""Call me."" || I went skiing today, too, yeah. I didn't wanna go. The girl I'm stalking wanted to go, so… I'm not kiddin! || Eggnog, who thought that one up? “I wanna get a little drunk, but I also want some pancakes.” You know what eggnog really is. You’re not gonna want to hear it, but I’ll tell ya. It’s elf cum. You might as well pour it down your back and slap your self on the ass. || Why do they collect garbarge at 5am? Why? It's garbage. It’s not going to go bad again. || Sometimes you need a cigarette. Like after you have sex with a beautiful woman or a confused young man. || The balls are the posse of the penis. While the penis is inside you, making you happy, the balls are outside working security. It's a velvet rope situation. No one can get in now. Finger, not tonight. There's another club around the block, it's a little dirty, but I think you can squeeze in. || Premature ejaculation. Let's talk about it. Premature ejaculation. That's a pretty fancy term for, ""Ooooh Oh no. This has never happened before."" || Everyone was laughin'. Even that deaf mute boy was breathing heavy and pointing at me. Which is laughter to their kind. || If you take off your pants and her first reaction is, ""Awww, look at it... like a little baby Jesus."" Time to buy a Porsche. || The voice in my head has a stutter, and that's really annoying. ""D-D-D-Dave Dave."" What? ""K-K-K-Kill your p-p-p-parents. L-L-L-Loa…"" Write it down! || My gym has two-pound weights. If you're using two-pound weights, how did you even open the door to the gym? What's your dream? To pump up and open your mail? || She was drunk so I took her back to my place and we did it doggy style, not because we planned it that way, but that's just how she passed out. || Usually when you hear a laugh like that, it comes with a chainsaw. || I masturbate! I do it like I think if I keep doing it, I'm gonna win something. || Sex is not that important; it's the afterward part when you're naked and it's warm. Watching the sun come up through the windshield you look in her good eye and you help strap on her leg and you know: you fucked a pirate. || I'm sitting in the bus station, minding my own business, reading ‘Ta-Da!’ magazine; a magazine by and for gay magicians, but that's a different story. || If I had a kid, I'd give him a name that would make everyone would want to say his name. I'd call him, Pizza-Pussy-Santa. I would! Cause everybody likes one of those things. || You ever wake up with an erection, roll over, and think you broke your dick? || Never let a woman put a condom on ya. Do it yourself fellas. It's embarrassing. ""Oh look, oh look there's still more room! Ha Ha Ha! We could tie it off and use it again and again. Cause you've got a small penis; and I know, cause I work with children."" || Are you shooting webs of stupid at me? || The best you can do is just roll over and let it drip out. || When I was a kid, I really loved Indians. Native Americans. Pardon. Me. || I was in Dayton, Ohio. You ever been there? Ya? You know what’s a fun thing to do there? Pack up and get the fuck outta there. It’s boring. During the day we played the game of horseshoes. That game must have been invented before fun, ‘cause it’s not. There’s only two ways for that game to end, either ""This sucks let’s do something else,"" or ""Owww, you hit me with the horseshoe."" || Oopsy diddly. Pardon me madams, did I get me rah rah juice on your peepers? || I keep getting these people at my shows who only know me from television. I can always tell when they're, like, emotionally flinching when I start doing my jokes. || Amish Sex - Oh Jebediah, give it to me you Abraham Lincoln lookin' motherfucker. || Every eight minutes, someone has sex with an animal... and you wonder why the attack you. Because of that man, and its up to me and a half mexican to stop him! || Sex and murder are the same. Well, you say the same after both don't you? ""Damn I got to get the hell out of here!"" ""What was I thinking!"" || You're thinking I'm homophobic; I hear it all the time. ""Dave, you’re probably gay."" ""What?"" ""Well, you talk about being gay so you probably are gay! You probably secretly want to have sex with another man!"" And I say, ""Listen, Voice In My Head… I do not.""” ""How do you know you wouldn't like it? How do you know you wouldn't love it?"" I know I wouldn't like it or love it, because one time… during a terrible gardening accident, I sat on a cucumber… 3 times. || The other night I had the lonely bug so I went to this bar. I saw this beautiful girl there. I'm thinking, ""She's alone, I'm alone. Why not annoy the shit out of her?"" So I walk over, I'm walking, I'm wearing clogs. And I notice she has a black eye, she has a shiner. I'm thinking, ""Great. She doesn't listen."" So two McNuggets, three beers, and 50 dollars later we're back at my house doing it doggy style. Not that I planned on it, that’s just how she passed out. Thank you slow gas leak. || Sometimes it's hard to tell if a joke is working or not for the first couple of minutes. || Florida looks like a gigantic penis! Doesn't it? Have you ever googled it? It looks like a gigantic peener! About to shoot a load of freedom all over Cuba. A bukkake of choices and ideas. || If I was to have sex with one animal it would be a horse. That is a beautiful animal. And when you have sex with a horse, you know you always have a ride home. || Women have all the power because women have all the vaginas. || They have a luggage store at the airport? I mean, how late do you have to be running? Don't worry honey just grab a pile of shit... we'll get a bag at the airport! || I don't have a girlfriend but sometimes I like to pretend I do. I just stand in my apartment screaming ""No, that's not what I said!"" || Ever make fun of someone so much that you feel you should thank them for all the good times? I've got a midget friend, an albino friend, and another friend who thinks ""Lord of the Rings"" is real. Together we call ourselves ""the Unfuckables."" || I went to a sex store, and i was drunk. Never do that. I took one of those strap-on dildos, I put it on my head and started chasing people like a rhino. Oh, God. Oh my God! Everyone was laughing, except for the guy in the kilt. I don’t know what happened, but i’m sorry. || If you go to Germany and get drunk, at some point you will try to look up Hitler in the phone book. || If I need directions I'm not asking a man with one tooth, I'm asking a man with one leg. Cause he definitely knows the easiest way to get there. Yup, if there's a shortcut that one legged fucker knows where it is. You won't be hoppin fences neither. || The vagina is its own little person. It gets haircuts from time to time, sometimes it has its own lawyer. Everything affects it: kittens, balloon rides, Dave Matthews in concert. What affects the penis? Whiskey and pepper spray, that's it. || I'm very romantic when I masturbate. I light some candles. Then I try to shoot them out when I'm done. Never invite me to a birthday party. || Have you seen that magazine ""Barely Legal""? That means when you look at it, you're ""almost"" a pedophile. || What's the two things they tell you are healthiest to eat? Chicken and fish. You know what you should do? Combine them, eat a penguin. || People are so defensive, especially women, ya know. C'mon ladies. I offered a girl a tic-tac one time. Ya know what she says to me ""Oh do I need one? Is it my breath? Do you think I need one?"" I'm like, I'm just trying to be nice. If I was going to give you something you needed I would give you mustache wax and a t-shirt that says 'One Cock at a Time.' || Yeah, I know, some people are against drunk driving, and I call those people ""the cops."" But you know, sometimes, you've just got no choice; those kids gotta get to school! || You see a guy with one leg, he's got a story. ""Land mine '69."" You see a guy with one arm, he's got a story, too. ""Snow blower, bottle of whiskey."" You see a guy with one tooth, what would the story be? ""Well, uh, I like a lot of taffy."""
Dave Chappelle,"I got 10 minutes I'm saving. If you do it, I'll do it. || This is the concert I've always wanted to see. || By the numbers, this was the worst way to have done it. He couldn't think straight. It was fight or flight - and he chose flight. || I hate you. I hate you. I don’t even know you, and I hate your guts. I hope all the bad things in life happen to you and nobody else but you. || One of the things that happens when people make the leap from a certain amount of money to tens of millions of dollars is that the people around you dramatically change. || My generation is under-entertained. || All these years, I thought I liked chicken cause it was delicious; but turns out, I'm genetically predisposed to liking chicken! || Weed’s not as bad as everything else… ’cause weed is a background substance. You know what I mean, you can smoke some herb and still function. You ain’t crisp… but you’ll function. || I don't normally talk about my religion publicly because I don't want people to associate me and my flaws with this beautiful thing. And I believe it is beautiful if you learn it the right way. || Oh my god. Open and shut case, Johnson. I saw this once when I was a rookie. Apparently this nigger broke in and put up pictures of his family everywhere. || Lady, I'm just a nigga that loves titties. || We just jumped out and started shooting with the band, and then one thing led to another. You see it unfold in the movie, but by the end of just hanging with them we had decided, 'Why don't we have them come to Brooklyn?' It was pretty awesome. || It's Friday bitches! Lets get fucked up! || I was on vacation at Disney World, and everybody kept coming up to me and saying 'Hey, I'm Rick James, bitch.' I was like, 'Could you not call me a bitch in front of my kids?' || I'm cool with failing so long as I know that there are people around me that love me unconditionally. || Terrorists don't take black hostages. That's the truth. I have yet to see one of us on the news reading a hostage letter. Like, 'Uh... they is treating us good. Uh we are chilling and shit. I'd like to give a shout out to Ray-Ray an Big Steve and uh, send some Newports!' || The old baby on the corner trick a, not gonna fall for that shit. || I think extreme sports are really good for relieving stress. || I look at it like that word, 'nigger', used to be a word of oppression. But that when I say it, it feels more like an act of freedom. For me to be able to say that unapologetically on television. || Wow. That's a good question. Is ""I don't know"" an acceptable answer? || I love being famous - it's phenomenal. || No one wants to get their ass beat to a soundtrack. || I love my jokes. || I enjoy my own thoughts sometimes. || I got a big kick out of that, actually. I think even when we were doing the concert ... everyone thought it was kind of cool that three busloads of people came from southwest Ohio. || New white people, you can't scare these white people, I tried. || ""Hey, baby! Stop selling weed, all right, you've got your whole life ahead of you."" He goes, ""Fuck you, nigga. I got kids to feed!"" || There was something really serendipitous that was happening, with some kind of energy that things would ultimately just work out, sometimes better than when you plan. || But there was something really serendipitous that was happening, with some kind of energy that things would ultimately just work out, sometimes better than when you plan. || My father told me 'Name your price in the beginning. If it ever gets more expensive than the price you name, get out of there.' || The mark of greatness is when everything before you is obsolete, and everything after you bears your mark. || Dave! Relax! Close your buttcheeks! || I don’t do drugs, though. Just weed. || Then Jasper said ""Look here, nigger, if anyone's gonna have sex with my sister, it's gonna be me."" || And I didn't know he was taking me to the ghetto at first. I started looking out the window, see gun store, gun store, liquor store, gun store, where the fuck you taking me? || I'm not smoking crack. I'm definitely stressed out. || I don't really frick with Africa cause people are starving to death and that's not ballin' to me. || If you're Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, and your marriage is breaking up - that's an awful thing. But to see that speculation in people, it's gotta sting a little bit. || The hardest thing to do is to be true to yourself, especially when everybody is watching. || I was doing sketches that were funny, but socially irresponsible. It was encouraged. || What did the five fingers say to the face? SLAP!!!! || You got to be careful of the company you keep. || When I'm on stage, I get real happy there. Maybe that's the only time in my adult life I feel like myself. || No one calls 911 cool and relaxed. Now that shit would sound ridiculous. || The way the people around you position themselves around you to get in your pockets and in your mind is infuriating to me. || If I can make a teacher's salary doing comedy, I think that's better than being a teacher. || I think every group of black guys should have at least one white guy in it. || I'm off to the gym. Replacing good character with good looks is a cornerstone of my comeback stratagem. || Because I was surrounded by so much negativity at some point that it took me going back and doing stand-up to realize, you know, people really like me. || Somebody broke into my house once, this is a good time to call the police, but mmm..., nope. The house was too nice. It was a real nice house, but they'd never believe I lived in it. They'd be like 'He's still here!' || I got real important relationships in my life that are very empowering relationships. || I'm rich biotchh! || They got a character on there named Oscar, they treat this guy like shit the entire show. They judge him right in his face, ""Oscar you are so mean! Isn't he kids?"", ""Yeah Oscar! Your a grouch!"", its like ""Bitch! I live in a fucking trashcan!"" || What is wrong with me I just bought a bag of weed from an infant. || I don't want the money. I don't want the drama. I just want to do my show. I want to have fun again. || Hey, niggers! Turn that jungle music down! Woogie boogie, nigger! Woogie boogie! || I've been a comedian since I was fourteen. But I've never really been a CEO. || I'm famous today. People like me today. Might not like me tomorrow. You can't count on it. || I'm an introspective dude. || I still think people do have racial hang-ups, but I think one of the reasons I can joke about it is people are shedding those racial hatreds. || I just always loved stand-up. It's like magic. You say something, and a whole room full of people laughs together. Say something else, they laugh again. The fact that people come to see that and participate in that... I don't know, it's just like magic. || I got a lot of positive people around me. || Being famous is great, it's not like bad or horrible or anything. || Everyone around me says, You're a genius! You're great! That's your voice! But I'm not sure if they're right. || I care about the work I do. But I'm not going to say that money's not an issue. || Most of the people around me have a vested interest in how much money I make. You know, so a celebrity could find themselves in a position where people could have meetings about their life without them involved. And when I say 'their life' I mean not their professional life either. They could talk about their personal life. || Where I'm from? A little town called none of yo god damn business. || I figured, let me just cut myself off from everybody, take a minute and pull a Flintstone, stop a speeding car by using my bare feet as brakes. || You know, be able to do something great in your life, you're gonna have to realize your failures. You're gonna have to embrace them and figure out how to overcome it. || After a while, a joke, if you say it too much, just becomes contrived, or fake-sounding. || America, I appreciate you liking me. || Comedy is a very approval-oriented field. || Fame for me is like a place, a country I'm taking a tour through. || Is this the 5:00 Free Crack Giveaway? || I knew it was a bad idea, but I was high. I tried to explain to him that it was a bad idea but all that came out was well nigger sometimes you gotta race, I don't know. || I get a little heated when I talk about the past. But I wanted to be clear - I'm not mad at anybody - not anymore. || The worst thing to call somebody is crazy. It's dismissive. || Remember what the Bible says: He who is without sin, cast the first rock. And I shall smoketh it. || Who got the part? Chris Tucker? Shit! Who got the other part? Tell me man. Jackie Chan? That mother fucker can't even speak English! || The language you are about to hear... is disturbing. || I was doing sketches that were funny but socially irresponsible. I felt I was deliberately being encouraged and I was overwhelmed. || I don't care if I ever work in TV again. || I felt in a lot of instances I was deliberately being put through stress because when you're a guy who generates money, people have a vested interested in controlling you. || I've done 10 or 11 pilots for network television, which is ridiculous. || If I put forth a legitimate effort, then I feel like, if that doesn't work out, that's all I can do. || The world can't tell you who you are. You've just got to figure out who you are and be there, for better or worse. || There's a lot of people who don't want anything from me but to laugh and have a good time. You see them at the show and they like - they dress up to come see your show and stuff. And they pack these auditoriums and it's a lot of fun, man. It's like, this is how I started, and it's still fun for me. || The higher up I went, the less happy I was. || The only thing harder than leaving show business is coming back. || You can become famous but you can't become unfamous. You can become infamous but not unfamous. || I want to tell my jokes. I want to have time with my children. I want to entertain people. And at one point, I'll walk away from show business. But I don't want to walk away empty-handed. || You know you must be doing something right if old people like you. || All I'll say about Elian is thank God he's Cuban. 'Cause if he was Haitian you'd've never heard about his ass. If Elian Gonzales was Elian Mumumbo from Haiti, they would've pushed that little rubber tube right back in the water. ""Sorry little fella, all full. Good luck!"" || Stand-up is the kind of gig that'll show you where you're at. || There's something about doing stand-up that's cathartic. || Whether it means having a show, or a movie, or just being on a stage, I need an avenue to say what I have to say. || I see that they put every black man in the movies in a dress at some point in his career. || All white people talk about when they get high is other times that they got high. || Something about New York, man: You can do more comedy there probably than you can anywhere in the world. If you're interested in being funny, New York is the place to go. || I'm Dave Chappelle and I'm a chronic masturbator. || I wasn't crazy but it is incredibly stressful. || My wife asked me once if I weren't a comedian what I would do. I couldn't answer the question. I never imagined doing anything else. || If you don't have the right people around you and you're moving at a million miles an hour you can lose yourself. || Most people don't know what it's like to stand up there and speak their mind. I have a venue to do that. I get paid to do that. It's not like I'm doing heavy lifting up there. It's not like I'm solving the world's problems. It's like I'm hanging out with a bunch of people and it's cool. || People don't know what it's like standing up there onstage, when you have a wall of people smiling at you. || Why don't you click your heels three times and go back to Africa. || I don't like letting my friends drive drunk, but I was smoking a joint I really couldn't say shit to the guy."
David Alan Grier,"I try to make my bed every day for mental health. Coming home to an unmade bed or a room with clothes all over will depress me. || I wanted to be a leading man - the black lawyer, the black doctor, the black policeman. || I wanted something where I could have the clearest and most unfiltered artistic and creative voice. || I've tried actively to define myself and redefine myself, and not be pigeonholed. || I started acting at the University of Michigan in my sophomore year. || I, myself, identify myself as a heathen. || My father was a doctor. || I couldn't wait to be, you know, a Black Panther. Of course they wouldn't let me join. || America is grappling with cultural diversity, and I just want to put a show on that represents the world in which I live. || Don't let anyone try to tell you who you are. Define yourself. || I want to see gay couples stuck with their significant other at Home Depot with that far away look in their eye, get me out of here. || I decided sitcoms weren't for me. || My grandmother was born in 1900, and she would regale me with tales I call 'Little House on the Prairie' tales, but they were tales of segregated and racist America growing up in Alabama and Mississippi, where she came from. || The president is always made fun of. || To be known by the public, honestly. People come up and tell them how good I make them feel. || My father contracted polio on a troop train in Korea. || I never wanted to lose out on an acting job and wonder if I hadn't been trained enough. || Every little kid has always wanted to be a race car driver. This gets some of that out. || 'Dancing With the Stars' is so Middle America, and people take it so seriously. || I had done the sitcom thing to lesser and lesser degrees of success. || I grew up in a home and in a world in which you can do anything. We were all expected to go to college. My father was a doctor. || When I was a kid, I wanted to walk with my dad's limp - my dad was my hero - but that infuriated him, and he would make me walk back and forth in the living room until I walked without it. || A friend of mine had his own theatre company, and he jumped me in like I was in a gang. And once I came in, it was just that simple. For the first time in my life, I felt, 'This is a career, this is a life that I think I can grow old doing.' It was love at first sight. I loved being on stage and reading these plays. It was great. || As I get older, my sense of humour is my biggest asset. || Be talented enough to make it and stupid enough to keep trying. || I think Chelsea Handler is the funniest woman. || Some days I think I look kind of cute, but other days I try to avoid the mirror."
David Brenner,"Misers aren't fun to live with, but they make wonderful ancestors. || It isn't how much time you spend somewhere that makes it memorable; it's how you spend the time. || The truth is that God is to be found in all things - even and most especially in the painful, tragic and unpleasant things. || Entrepreneurs with disabilities are overwhelmingly successful. || We can place a product, virtually any size, in almost any location. It really depends on what the program and the video in each individual episode provides in terms of a logical or contextual background. || You weren't doing a Cher thing. This wasn't your 12th farewell tour. || We work very, very hard to find that fine line where location is meaningful enough to be interesting to an advertiser but not so intrusive that it interrupts the creative flow of the show. || Digital brand integration is part of the evolution of product placement. It's simply another tool marketers use to get products integrated into shows. If you can put it in a package, we can put it in a show. || When Mrs. Clinton ran for office, she promised economic growth across New York state, to bring in more than 200,000 jobs, ... She has not. We have lost jobs to outsourcing and globalization and to sending our jobs and industries to foreign countries. || These particles can damage the cells in the lining of our lungs and produce lung cancer. || We're careful not to saturate people. || I said, 'How would you like to be in one place?' He said, 'What place?' I could have said, 'Des Moines.' || You know you're getting old when kids start to dress like you used to and movies are made about your teen life. || You know you're getting old when... you start to dress in more than six colours. || Its probably lower than that, but I doubt very much it's zero, ... It's a large number of Americans dying each year. || You could place one product in a first-run telecast, a second product what that program is rerun, and a third product when the show goes into syndication, and another product when it goes on cable. || We cannot attain the presence of God. We're already totally in the presence of Fod. What's missing is awareness. || Nothing is going to stop Mike Tyson that doesn't have a motor attached. || A vegetarian is a person who won't eat anything that can have children. || I don't like to watch golf on television because I can't stand people who whisper. || What we want to do is raise the bare minimum amount that will give us a large enough microphone to effectively convey our message. Unfortunately, $20 million is critical mass in terms of running an effective campaign in New York. || The bar has been raised for both Chicago teams. || When I go to a bar, I don't go looking for a girl who knows the capital of Maine."
David Cross,"Aqua Teen Hunger Force is one of the funniest shows on TV and I was a little intimidated working with those guys 'cause you're in a sound booth by yourself and they're all in a room in Atlanta. || The Bible is the funniest book I have ever read. It's so funny! Right in the first six pages, it's funny! || When we were on the bus doing the Mr. Show Hooray for America Tour there was a lot of laughter and a lot of pot smoking and a lot of speed metal listening and video game playing. Of course that was all Brian Posehn. || You can't say minimum wage to people when they're asking you questions. ""What are you making now?"" ""Minimum wage. Yeah. Lowest amount legally possible. Yeah. That's where I'm at right now. Oh, they'd like to pay me less. But they can't. Legally they can't. I win! I'm the winner!"" || As for Tenacious D, of course it could work as a full length movie; all it requires is a great writer and great director with an ability to think outside of conventional film comedy. || And the Pope is infallible. We're taught that. Pope can't make a mistake. So I don't know why the Catholic church just doesn't take that motherfucker to Vegas. 'All right, put all the Catholic Church's money on 17 black.' '32 red, I'm sorry.' 'No, I don't think you heard, he said 17 black! Thank you! Let's go to Bellagio!' That way they could pay off those debts they owe. || It's hip to be square. Remember that shitty song by that shitty band 20 motherfucking years ago? || Originally they wanted me to be Buster but I really like the Tobias part. || They think globally but act locally, which is part of my t-shirt philosophy course that I teach in Brooklyn. || In New York, you are constantly faced with this very urgent decision that you have to make, about every twenty minutes...you have to decide, immediately, you have to go ""Ohmigod. Do I look at the most beautiful woman in the world or the craziest guy in the world?"" || I am against the war, but I do support our white troops. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm not a Republican. I'm not a member of the party of inclusion. Wonderful, tolerant, rational human beings they are... || All my friends are always telling me how hard it is to have kids. 'Oh, David, it's so hard.' That's not hard. I'll tell you what hard is. Try talking your girlfriend into her third consecutive abortion. Yeah, that's hard, that takes finesse. You’re just inconvenienced. || You have to have some level of attachment, you can still have passion and believe but it has to be softened somewhat. || There is also a kind of mean-spiritedness with LA comics. || If you want to reinstate the 14.4 billion dollars that Bush cut out of the veterans program then vote democrat. || If you wanna find out 101 things to do with plums, heh, read your in-flight magazine. || There is nothing interesting about just seeing me doing the show then seeing the fans and how much people love me. || High Times magazine is a notch intellectually below Highlights for Children. I mean, they're both great to read when you're baked, but come on, ya know... || I thought it would be way more interesting to show the drunk people, the hecklers. || I'm going to be putting together a tour, where myself and some like-minded comics go out. || People are condescending, they don't listen, and it's contributed to a really unfortunate anti-intellectualism in this country. || Because I think whenever you sit down with another human being who would absolutely disagree with you on every issue, you learn about them as a person and you relate, in human terms, and it's much more difficult for either side to dismiss out of hand, like that person's a freak, that person's a Nazi. || Rickey Henderson, pick up the phone, man, it's me... you. || Here's a little what it was like for me growing up in Atlanta... They had this ill-fated thing called 'Light Up Atlanta'. So, I'm standing in line... I tap the guy in front of me and say, ""Uh, excuse me, can you tell me if this is the line for the beer, or the line to get the tickets to get the beer.' 'I dunno, faggot.' I don't know, faggot? What? What did I do? Was it because I was sucking his cock at the time? || At that point, we worked to contain the fire from the outside. || It's just an easy catchall to describe a style because there are a lot of alternative comics who are completely different from each other. || We are just pleased to help out, ... We want to help people that may be evacuating the Gulf Coast area to have some normalcy and take their minds off Hurricane Katrina for a couple of hours. || If the owner hadn't come and seen the smoke, by time this place opened tonight it would have been rolling. || I don't think of my opponents in the sense that I don't think of them consciously, I don't steer it one way or the other. || We mostly get together and have fun. It's a great place to play music with a small group of nice people. || I don't think HBO would want to do anything in conjunction with Sub Pop but I never asked either. || Abandoned babies are unfortunate unwanted results of a once urgent desire to have an orgasm. || I don't mean this to sound hyperbolic but there are increasingly, albeit really minor, similarities between now and how Germany was lulled into what happened pre-WW2. || I recently attended a pro-drug rally... in my basement. || I think pornography is the only art form where you can be videotaped on a shaky handy cam sucking off a horse and be considered a star. || I have a few business ideas (that I'm going to advertise in High Times, amongst other places), and one of them is a service in which I offer to eat and describe pork to kosher people. || If the terrorists hated freedom, the Netherlands would be fucking dust. || If someone gives you a kazoo and toots around the house to MTV, they're not gonna fuck you. || I love doing stuff with Todd Barry and Jon Benjamin. We give the stage to good bands and funny people. || The best thing about me is there are no skeletons. || So at the CES, there was a guy selling off this porno called Fuck My Dirty Shithole: The Movie. I bet you're thinking exactly what I was thinking … how did they make that book into a movie? || So I was watching all the Katrina coverage and I got really angry at... Christians who didn't pray hard enough... It's their fucking fault. First off, they needed to pray against the people that were praying for Katrina to hit, because New Orleans is a den of sin and iniquity; an area where gay people dance! But now they have to pray double, and if they had just put that little effort up front, we could've avoided all of this. I think it's time we take a lesson from history, and return to human sacrifice. || Some of those heckling parts are just great on their own plus they happened at that moment so we had to include it. || I work a lot and I like to get out and work but the work I do to make the other work work I'm not very good at. || Now I'm used to my daily, almost hourly, outrage at what's happening in this country. || I just often find myself getting shrill, angry and the jokes get more incredulous. || And then Jesus answered him, Jesus said, 'Well, my son...that is when I was helping one of the other five billion people on the planet, you selfish fuck. C'mon! You were walking back to your Malibu beach colony home and stubbed your toe on some driftwood, it's not a fuckin' emergency, alright? There's other people with real problems.' || And y'know, they're God's representatives, so that means... God fucks little boys. || I don't remember ordering the Christian sandwich... || There are a lot of reasons for that. For one, we have good light here. || There are really funny alternative comics and really funny straight comics who write and perform traditionally. || The second piece of news is something that I would imagine most people have heard about by now. Arrested Development got picked up for a third season. || Besides if people really want to support the troops they would vote democrat. || Radio DJ's are the same two motherfucking asshole clowns all over the country. I hate radio interviews. 'You didn't know it David, but you're just in time for the Friday Morning Fart Song!' No, sorry, I'm not doing that. Even if it's only fifteen minutes, it's the worst fifteen minutes of your life. I don't care if you've been in a fucking shark attack. If I was in a shark attack, and then they had no anesthetic and they had to heal it up, sew it up, I would be like, 'This sucks,' but then if two DJ's came in and interviewed me I'd fucking shoot myself. || James Lipton: The most pompous arrogant failure in history. || I do lots of other drugs but I smoke pot maybe 5-10 times a year now. I used to smoke it all the time, but I don't, and I haven't for awhile. That's just because it makes me - and I'm not saying this about everybody else - but it makes me kind of dumb and self-conscious. || I read the New York Times, and if I'm in a different city, I'll skim that paper. || All my friends are always telling me how hard it is to have kids. 'Oh, David, it's so hard.' That's not hard. I'll tell you what hard is. Try talking your girlfriend into her third consecutive abortion. Yeah, that's hard, that takes finesse. You’re just inconvenienced. || I thought it was really odd at how much people freaked out at Katrina. You'd think they'd be worried about something important. 'Oh my God, look! George Bush is just appointing all his friends into office and we're in an unfounded war...' But no - 'Fuck that! That nigger's stealing some potato chips!' || I hate bumper stickers, you can't sum anything up. All you do is paint yourself in some caricaturist corner. || The South has more of a disproportionate amount of irony on T-shirts than any other region in the country. || I went to a bunch of marches in New York and Washington, and you know I believe in the cause, but to march with those people takes a lot of compromise on my end. || In New York there isn't that weird palpable competitive thing where it's friendly but everyone isn't trying to top one another with jokes when you're just hanging around. || Sketches have characters, exits, entrances and are vastly different. || In New York there isn't that weird palpable competitive thing where it's friendly but everyone isn't trying to top one another with jokes when you're just hanging around. || So all my friends have kids now... which I think is rude. || It's not an issue per say, but I would urge people to help create an atmosphere where they don't see this complete ideological divide. || I've got a lot of friends there and there is stuff to do but as much as I dislike LA I really like living and working in New York City. || I just recorded another CD for Sub Pop. || I lived in LA for almost nine years and if I never went back there again it would be fine. || I also try to think of ways to articulate the joke more economically. || I remember being a kid and the Vietnam War was huge and looking at Watergate. || Then I will tape the sets and even though I'm not very successful sometimes I will try to cut out the fat and put the jokes closer together. || I know that can hit close to home for some people....was anyone here aborted?... 'I was found in a trash can!' Okay, well, that sorta counts... || We get to see it! January 1st, 2000! We get to see... all those fundamentalist preachers having to do their backpedaling when the Armageddon doesn't occur. || I don't think Osama bin Laden sent those planes to attack us because he hated our freedom. I think he did it because of our support for Israel, our ties with the Saudi family and our military bases in Saudi Arabia. You know why I think that? Because that's what he fucking said! Are we a nation of 6-year-olds? Answer: yes. || I really don't have a problem with gay marriage... because I'm tolerant and rational. || I have always tried to use humour to ""help ever"" and ""hurt never,"" for I find that to laugh is like swallowing a secret that Santa Claus farted. || I guess the lesson to be learned from the church is that while homosexuality is a sin against God, molestation and rape, well... they're just sins against a child. || I love Tinkle, it's really the most fun I've had in years. || We should just get somebody from the left and the right and they should all throw bumper stickers at each other and the first one to cover the other one wins. || You can't just yell jokes at people. || Occasionally I'll watch Fox News for as long as I can tolerate it, or CNN. I'll watch until I get infuriated, but you got to know what they're talking about and what they're not talking about. || Nobody is going to be as bad for free thinking, right-minded individuals than George Bush. || My biggest problem is retaining the exact information. || It's not about trying to be funny all the time. It's more of a document that hopefully is funny. || I'll think of the idea and then I'll write something down, then within that there will be a joke or two which is the original thing which I thought was funny. || I'd be curious to find out, but I don't think people in the entertainment industry are proportionally more or less serious politically than anyone in the landscaping industry. || I think people, for the most part, actually want what they think is best. || There were a number of referendums in '98 that most of the things I voted for passed. That's very satisfying when you feel that most of the country is in step with your views."
David Letterman,"Gays are now allowed to serve openly in the military. So maybe our next war could be a musical. || A woman in Buffalo set a new world record for eating 183 buffalo wings. I don’t think there will be a second date. || Republicans are having trouble luring Gov. Chris Christie into the presidential race. They should try pie. || I've had nothing but great friendship to help me through this. || BP has put more birds in oil than Colonel Sanders. || Because you think an explosion has taken place and you're looking at the shards and you say, 'Well, can we put this back together?' And by God, maybe you can put it back together. And maybe it won't be the same, but maybe it will be different, and maybe it can even be better in a different way. || Labour day is a great American holiday that people celebrate by going out and buying products made in China. || Anything worth doing is worth overdoing. || If what you've done is stupid, but it works... then it really isn't all that stupid. || It's so warm now, and Thanksgiving came so early - is it just me, or does it not really feel like Ramadan? || I'm just trying to make a smudge on the collective unconscious. || Last night the United States dropped four 2,000 pound bombs on Saddam Hussein. I don't know anything about explosives, but, my God, do those things even need to explode? || Next in importance to having a good aim is to recognize when to pull the trigger. || As you know now, Rush Limbaugh is the new face of the Republican Party, but they'll probably go with a different body. || I had no idea this thing was televised. Boy, is my face red. || I know these jokes aren't great, ladies and gentlemen, see this is the problem you run into when you're between impeachments. || Based on what you know about him in history books, what do you think Abraham Lincoln would be doing if he were alive today? 1) Writing his memoirs of the Civil War. 2) Advising the President. 3) Desperately clawing at the inside of his coffin. || It's official, Arnold said he will enter the race for governor. At least that's what everybody thinks he said. || President Bush has been silent on Schwarzenegger. Of course, he can't pronounce Schwarzenegger. || President Bush has said that he does not need approval from the UN to wage war, and I'm thinking, well, hell, he didn't need the approval of the American voters to become president, either. || The big debate right now is if Saddam is alive or dead. He's dead, then he's alive, then dead, then alive. It's just confusing. Today they showed videotape, and Saddam was speaking at his own funeral. || The weather here is gorgeous. It's mild and feels like it's in the eighties. The hot dog vendors got confused because of the weather and thought it was spring, so they accidentally changed the hot dog water in their carts. || There's only one requirement of any of us, and that is to be courageous. Because courage, as you might know, defines all other human behaviour. And, I believe - because I've done a little of this myself - pretending to be courageous is just as good as the real thing. || We make a lot of fun at President Clinton's expense. But this transition is going to be tough because it's been 25 years since this guy has gotten laid in the private sector. || Wherever we've travelled in this great land of ours, we've found that people everywhere are about 90% water. || People say New Yorkers can't get along. Not true. I saw two New Yorkers, complete strangers, sharing a cab. One guy took the tires and the radio; the other guy took the engine. || I was once involved in a same-sex marriage. There was the same sex over and over and over. || If my brain hadn't shrunk, I'd be insulted. || Everybody is wondering what Paris Hilton will be doing next, and hell, I'm wondering what she did before. || How long have you been a black man? || I may not be smart enough to debate you point-for-point on this, but I have the feeling about 60% of what you say is crap. || The senator got so tired on the campaign trail that he started kissing hands and shaking babies. || Here's what the kids get. They get free McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken for a year, and 52 six-packs of Pepsi. And I'm thinking, well, actually, it might be healthier if they were taking steroids. || After my bypass surgery I knew I had to change my lifestyle, and then it occured to me - I don't have a lifestyle. || You can email me, but I prefer letters that come through conventional mail. I like letters that have been licked by strangers. || I'm still here. I knocked off another competitor. || I'm nothing if not an optimist. || A pair of ruby red slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz have been stolen. The thief is described as being armed and fabulous. || In the debate Bush appeared confident, he appeared relaxed, he appeared calm. That's right, he's drinking again. || I think you can use some of those words on TV. But one thing you can't do is throw coffee, I've said it over and over again! || This isn't brain surgery; it's just television. || Fine art and pizza delivery - being a talk-show host falls neatly in between. || But there are some nice aspects during the transition period. For example, the Bush twins gave the Obama girls a tour of the White House. It was very sweet, but the Obama girls got really scared because they heard creepy organ music coming from Cheney's underground lair. || They found a massive stash of porn in Osama bin Laden's compound. Right now CIA agents are screening the pornography carefully, frame by frame, looking for clues. || Sarah Palin, part-time Governor of Alaska, is angry because Michele Obama is encouraging kids to eat healthy. Sarah Palin believes the government shouldn't tell us what to do. Sarah Palin believes she should tell us what to do. || Last Halloween I ran out of candy and I had to give the kids nicotine gum. || According to the Rand McNally Places-Rated Almanac, the best place to live in America is the city of Pittsburgh. The city of New York came in twenty-fifth. Here in New York we really don't care too much. Because we know that we could beat up their city anytime. || I think the one thing I would point to as a primary reason, basically, is that I was a gigantic ass, ... It's the first time I got dumped in my life. || Show me squid! || The Japanese Prime Minister has apologized for Japan's part in World War II. However, he still hasn't mentioned anything about karaoke. || The Security and Exchanges Commission is going to be investigating Vice President Dick Cheney. They'll begin that investigation as soon as Congress finishes investigating the Security and Exchanges Commission. || In just a few minutes, my son will have completed his first trip around the sun. || I took a walk in Central Park and got all excited when I thought I saw a robin redbreast. Turned out to be a pigeon with a knife wound. || An anthropologist at Tulane has just come back from a field trip to New Guinea with reports of a tribe so primitive that they have Tide but not new Tide with lemon-fresh Borax. || Be suspicious of any doctor who tries to take your temperature with his finger. || They just opened a Starbucks across the street from a Starbucks. || Newt Gingrich wants to repeal child labor laws. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the man that we need to lead us into the 18th century. || Somebody threw a book at President Obama. If you're trying to scare a president by throwing a book at him, you're one president too late. || President Obama went to India, South Korea, then Japan. He's going to keep travelling until he finds his birth certificate. || The winner of the Westminster Dog Show gets to drink champagne - out of the toilet. || The first Presidential debate was down in Florida. Residents spent all day putting plywood on their televisions. || Please kids, I beg you. Don't be stealing beer underage. || Obesity is now a problem in the navy. They've created a new rank: Really Big Rear Admiral. || You know you've had too much to eat for Christmas dinner when you slump down onto a beanbag and realize... there is no beanbag. || I know you're on the Atkins diet, but could you stop eating bacon during sex? || You know what I love best about baseball? The pine tar, the resin, the grass, the dirt - and that's just in the hot-dogs. || Let's see what's going on over in Iraq. A Burger King has opened up and prostitutes are back on the street of Baghdad after 20 years. Fast food and hookers - they are truly living the American Dream. || John Kerry made a mistake of saying something embarrassing while a microphone was on. And now he's been backpedaling. So now he's hired a guy and his sole job is to make sure John Kerry's microphone is off. It's the same guy that used to watch Clinton's fly. || You have Kim Jong Il, and you have his brother, Menta Lee Il. || The world's oldest woman passed away at 116. They keep dying. I think that title may be cursed. || Sometimes when you look in his eyes you get the feeling that someone else is driving. || If it wasn't for the coffee, I'd have no identifiable personality whatsover. || Congratulations are in order for Woody Allen - he and Soon Yi have a brand new baby daughter. It's all part of Woody's plan to grow his own wives. || Happy Birthday to Fay Wray, a wonderful actress. She was, of course, in the movie ""King Kong"" and would have been 99-years-old today. She was famous because of her love interest with a giant ape, and, wait a minute, that's Maria Shriver. || You like science? You enjoy science? Always use it for good, never for evil. Can you promise me that? || The Catholic Church has a tough new policy on child molestors: three strikes and you're a cardinal. || Life experience is the best teacher. || There's not a man, woman or child on the face of the earth who doesn't enjoy a tasty beverage. || I'm an environmentalist. Most of my jokes are recycled. || The White House is giving George W. Bush intelligence briefings. You know, some of these jokes just write themselves. || Hillary Clinton, our junior senator from New York, announced that she has no intentions of ever, ever running for office of the President of the United States. Her husband, Bill Clinton, is bitterly disappointed. He is crushed. There go his dreams of becoming a two-impeachment family. || You know, they don't give these shows to chimps! || The morning after I had my heart bypass, the doctor called and said, ""Soon you'll be able to have sex."" I said, ""I've heard that for years."" || Nothing, believe me, nothing is more satisfying to me personally than getting a great idea and then beatin' it to death. || It's the first day of spring. That means this weekend I'll take down my Christmas lights. || Halloween is the beginning of the holiday shopping season. That's for women. The beginning of the holiday shopping season for men is Christmas Eve. || I like Halloween. It gives you a chance to dress up like something you're not, you know? Like when the Miami Dolphins put on football uniforms. || I haven't reached nirvana yet, but I've been to Detroit. || America is the only country where a significant proportion of the population believes that professional wrestling is real but the moon landing was faked. || There's no business like show business, but there are several businesses like accounting. || You got yourself a butt sniffing monkey. || And hold on, I'm sure they're pissed off about something. || Valentine's Day money-saving tip: Break up on February 13th, get back together on the 15th. || Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, everybody loves them. But I thought this was interesting on the box, 'Konsult Kardiologist.' || It was stupid behaviour. And you take a look at the explosion, and it knocks you down and you wake up every morning and you're scared and you're depressed and sad, and you kind of got to let that knock you down and knock you down. || There is no off position on the genius switch. || I got my lips chewed off by a dingo! || United Airlines: Passengers are our worst enemy. We're not too fond of luggage either. || Don't forget it's daylight savings time. You spring forward, then you fall back. It's like Robert Downey Jr. getting out of bed. || Dick Cheney said he was running again. He said his health was fine, 'I've got a doctor with me 24 hours a day.' Yeah, that's always the sign of a man in good health, isn't it? || A lot of folks are still demanding more evidence before they actually consider Iraq a threat. For example, France wants more evidence. And you know I'm thinking, the last time France wanted more evidence they rolled right through Paris with the German flag. || Experts say that Iraq may have nuclear weapons. That's bad news - they may have a nuclear bomb. Now the good news is that they have to drop it with a camel. || Fall is my favourite season in Los Angeles, watching the birds change colour and fall from the trees. || For the love of God, folks, don't try this at home. || Here's a little known fact - Arnold is the first body builder to run for governor since Janet Reno. || Iraq's elite Republican Guard is doing so badly they're changing their name to the Democratic Guard. || No one knows if Saddam is still alive. They keep showing old footage of him on TV saying that it's live. You know, it's like the same thing we do with Dick Cheney. || President Bush says he needs a month off to unwind. Unwind? When the hell does this guy wind? || USA Today has come out with a new survey - apparently, three out of every four people make up 75% of the population. || Yesterday Senator John Kerry changed his mind and now supports the ban on gay marriages. I'm telling you this guy has more positions than Paris Hilton. || I'm just trying to make a smudge on the collective unconscious. || It's very simple. There's only one requirement of any of us, and that is to be courageous. Because courage, as you might know, defines all other human behavior. And, I believe - because I've done a little of this myself - pretending to be courageous is just as good as the real thing. || Herman Cain was unaware that China is a nuclear power. And I said to myself, ""Hey, Herman, how about making an unwanted advance on a history book?"" || Mitt Romney looks like an American President in a Canadian movie. || I don't care who you are, I don't care what you do. If you have four funny stories, you can be a guest on this show. That's what we're looking for. || I got some good news earlier today before the show. Thanks to Alex Rodriguez, I am no longer the most overpaid disappointment in New York City. || Interesting poll results reported in today's New York Post: people on the street in midtown Manhattan were asked whether they approved of the US invasion of Grenada. Fifty-three percent said yes; 39 percent said no; and 8 percent said ""Gimme a quarter?"" || In Hollywood, Oscar is king. || Do I think there is a heaven? Uh, yeah I do. Like a really big gymnasium. How do I see myself there? With really bad seats. || We're told that they were zealots fueled by religious fervour ... religious fervour and if you live to be a thousand years old will that make any sense to you? Will that make any goddamn sense? || Tourists - have some fun with New York's hard-boiled cabbies. When you get to your destination, say to your driver, ""Pay? I was hitch-hiking."" || There is a new billboard outside Time Square. It keeps an up-to minute count of gun-related crimes in New York. Some goofball is going to shoot someone just to see the numbers move. || Here's my problem. On Valentine's Day the flowers are wilting and so am I. || New York City subways are now getting high speed Internet. How about some high speed subway trains? || Today, the L. A.

Now I need to apologise to the Lindsay Lohan family. I hope I didn't embarrass you and your family. || The candidates at the Republican debate looked like a town council that was outlawing dancing.

David Spade,"So I go in and I go into the snack bar. I don't think it should be legal to call anything that costs $18.50 a snack. Yeah, those are nice Twizzlers, do you have financial aid? || Staying in a hotel this time. They put me up in a little bit of a shithole. Yeah. Just this side of rinky dink. The first 7 floors are a homeless shelter, but I'm on 8. || The last girl I went out with blew me off. Now I call her with lame excuses to see her, “Hey, did I leave a penny over there?” || Watched Terms of Enrearment. Don't play dumb. Don't, it offends me. Bang the Nun Slowly. I think it's a remake. Your Ass Licked Part. That one's scary a little bit. There's one with midgets. Itty Bitty Gang Bang. I'm not sure if that was worth $7.95. It's a write off. Awww Schindler's Fist. So usually... I don't... I don't like the political stuff. The political porn isn't really where it's at late night. || Then she doesn't say anything. She waits. It brews in her head like a little El Nino. She calls me 4am. Not even a call, a fax. That's worse. It's jarring. It's right next to my head, nothing's worse. 7 page fax. First one has just got a big F on it. I don't like where it's headed. || Late night, thought we were so crafty in college. Maybe I'll come by late night, hun. If girls ever broke that down, it'd be bad. Let me guess, you're gonna go out with your friends, get hammered. And if you fail to nail some skank at a bar you'll come pound on my door at 4am. The more I say it, the more I like it.Mark me down for a yes. Late night. || With Saturday Night Live you're looking for any hook, any way to stay on the show. || Now that I have the opportunities to do a lot, I want to do less. || There are a couple hard things. One, getting a funny idea that people can relate to; a funny idea or a funny script; there's a million pitches. || People come and go around you, but you're never the one getting the big stuff. I like that. || On Sundays, I lay low, sulk a lot, and try to get my head together for next week. || Nobody wants to read about your life. Who cares? || My school of thought is, anything goes, but I can't do that anymore. || It's just easier to make fun and cut down. It's kind of a way of life in America. If you can make people want to hear what you're going to say, it can be cruel and funny. || It's great to tell people you have your own show, but that's where the fun stops. || It's brutal. I see friends when their shows don't work. Everything's riding on making money and all the pressure and how people scatter when fortunes turn downward. || If I try to cover too much ground, you start to get watered down and less interesting. || I've got people who like Tommy Boy, but they're getting older and there's a whole new wave of college kids who see that and Joe Dirt, and Just Shoot Me is a little older, so I wanted stuff for everybody. || When I'm interviewed on Leno, just be funny, period. That's all they want from me. I don't want to tell my life story. || You got to dump her buddy. That girl's a prude, you don't want none of that. You want a girl like your Mama. || Actually my Dad just took off. It was one of those divorces he split and he'd show up once a year and give me a Nerf football for Christmas. Thought he's my hero again. Woah it's two colors... you spoil me, you prick. || I have to wear a hat even indoors and flashes in particular freak me out. I even have to make them turn down the lights in the make-up trailers. I've become such a pain in the butt with this light-sensitive thing, it's a wonder they don't just shoot me. || I'm a gentleman and I was always taught it's rude, to talk about a woman's age or weight unless you are breaking up with her. || Spent most of the summer looking for shade. Driving around. Shade. Please? Driving in malls. I'll park a mile away I don't care. I'm just looking for a tree branch, anything. Long weed. Big leaf, get the front corner panel under it. Oh precious shade, I have it - you don't! || I go - that's a nice tie. That's right, Davie. Ralph Lauren regularly $80. A little tomato stain, you can barely see it, 4 bucks! Sweet. || Horrible date all through high school and college. Here's an impression of me on a date in high school. Come on, chug it! || Seriously, you don't have to know English. It'd be nice, a nice little plus. We don't want miracles. You don't have to know the country's language. But just some shapes, that's all. A square. A little geometry. || Last girl I went out blew me off, gave me the Heisman. Straight arm, knee up. Boom. Now I call her with lame excuses. Hey did I leave a penny over there? Maybe I'll swing by late night. Late night. || I'm always making fun of myself and my friends. || I talk to my dad all the time, he's more like my buddy than my father, and he's not happy that I use him in my act. But I tell him, I have to get something out of this. || Bill Murray I always liked. I'm not as good as him, but there's a quality in him that I like. And then there's DeNiro, I'll never be that. || It's just a campy blast. I just want to do as little as I can and make it good, and try not to sell out. I'm sure I will, but I'm just trying to postpone it. || When I started I'd fly across the country to do a gig for a hundred bucks. || Single guys get a bad rap. || No one wants to know I set my alarm and get up 8, but I think it's too weird to sleep in too late. || My career is just kind of crazy. || I've got to get on myself to be sharp, funny and loose. || I only have one note, let's be honest. But I'll play a different version of that one note. || To make money I picked up work as a busboy, valet parker, skateboard shop employee. || Everyone is so weird in L.A. that if you're somewhat normal, it's exotic. || There's always something funny about men chasing women. || You can either look at things in a brutal, truthful way that's depressing, or you can screw around and have fun. || I want to get away from it all. Move to the sticks. Montana. Hundreds of miles from civilization. Get a cabin in the snow. Curl up with some cute girl. Say stuff to her like, ""Scream all you want, sugar. Ain’t nobody gonna hear you!"" || Her call to me was a t shirt with a huge picture of me on the corner, monstrous. And under it said Dave. So you wouldn't be confused that this guy was this guy. Exact replica. || Donald Trump celebrated a birthday last week, when asked how it feels to be 61, Trump said, ""Rosie's a fat loser ... she's ugly on the inside"". || I wish I had that carefree lifestyle. But I guess I'm more private, and more inside. || I'm scared of slipping up, of just doing a joke that makes me laugh. || It's hard to have a career. || Most of the shows I want to do I'm not smart enough to figure out how to watch. || Sometimes when I watch a TV season, your favorite shows die quickly. And then sometimes it's not your favorite, and they live on for 12 years. || There are too many fawning entertainment shows out there and not one of them is making fun of it all. || I can see getting married and having a family, because it is the next thing on the agenda. You can only do this for so long. I'm old, and my friends all have kids. And I'm single, still blow drying my hair! || It wasn't a cutdown to call someone a Mexican. It would kill my career to refer to someone as Mexican today. It's like calling me an American. || But seriously I got hit by a car the other day. Yeah, I'm alright, I appreciate the concern. I was going about 8, the care behind me was going about 11. He wasn't getting to 11, he was at 11. But he was behind me so cha-ching! C4, C5, bingo! He gets out of the car about 105 years old. A little cooky in the head. I'm a little tattered. He starts saying things he probably shouldn't at the scene of an accident. Hell buddy, I wasn't even looking. Might want to keep that to yourself.Then he just keeps burying himself. I can't even drive a stick. I don't know which one is the brake. My legs are numb. I been drinking! || She goes how come I always catch you looking at slutty looking girls with big boobs. And I go, are you serious? Why? Um. That girl was wearing pink, and pink draws the eye. That's basic optometry hun, I'm surprised you didn't know that. || MySpace is a great way to keep in touch with friends who you don't care enough about to actually have a conversation with, why bother calling to say ""how are you,"" when you can just surf their page and post an mpeg of a guy farting on his cat. || I'm up. If that doesn't get me up, you know what will. Housekeeping. Housekeeping. Bink. No, need sleepy! || I've had it where things didn't go well for me with movies or something that got canceled. || It's just such a gross business. I see why people get eaten from the inside out. Even when it's going well it's hard to deal with. || To be famous and broke is hard. || In grade school I was smart, but I didn't have any friends. In high school, I quit being smart and started having friends. || I changed my act because I wasn't getting booked. || How do you lay low but still do your job? Try to stay out there without being out there like Jenny McCarthy? || I was a somewhat bright child, which led to different sorts of problems. In second grade, I moved up to fourth grade math and reading. There was an option to skip a grade but I was so tiny and microscopic that my mom was, like, 'He has enough now, let's not make his life totally terrible.' I stayed in my grade but alienated everyone by being, like, 'brainiac.' || I've been with a beautiful girl from time to time. || Don't make your kids look hot and dirty and sexy when they're 5-years old! It's really not the place or the time. You're about 11 years early. || I want to get back to my fighting weight of 98 pounds. I have the exact measurements of that guy from the movie, Powder. Right now, I am the reigning West Coast Powder. || Hopefully, underlying all my jokes is an element of surprise. || As boys get older, they can't let on that it's cool to meet me. || You know, you want to pull in a wide audience. || I'm still blow drying my hair, just trying to keep doing stuff that's fun. || I'm like a Dilbert cartoon. || I got into stand-up to get on a sitcom. || I wouldn't do this if I didn't like it. || Gossip is a plague that consumes weak, gullible people and blinds them from the truth of reality; it can devour entire city’s. I prefer keeping my eyes wide open. || I started doing the star turn and making a profit off it. Now I'm kind of one of them. || A little Everclear punch. We had Everclear punch. Everclear is like 3000 proof grain alcohol. Illegal in 44 states. Makes a nice little mixer. Put it with Hawaiian Punch you got a nice little cordial. Girls are like, I can't even taste it. We know. || My older brother was cool, so I was suddenly cool by association. And I totally dusted all my old math friends. || When my stepfather died, I just kind of fell apart. I felt pretty vulnerable, like there literally could be no tomorrow. || You know the drill. 18 is legal. 17 with consent. 16 with a note. 15 if her dad's in the room. Low five! || I have no detectable hair style. || I never dated much in high school or college. || It's so crazy in Hollywood. || I have no stories to sell. A lot of my relationships are with civilians, and no one wants to hear about those. || Success? You can't get a big head about it. When people stare at me, they could be whispering to their friend, 'That guy sucks! Have you seen him before? He's horrible.' || I asked my ex-girlfriend, “Do you think we’ll get back together?” She said, “I think the chances are better of me putting Super Unleaded into a rented car.” || I have two skateboards, but I don't get to use them much. I have a snowboard, which I've never used. || The hard part about SNL is, there's no real communication when you get there. It's not like people are mean to you, they just act like you're not there. || Stayed up and watched a little spanktrovision. It's the American way. There's really nothing wrong with spanktrovision. One of the best inventions of the 1900s, 20th century. || I don't like throwing myself in a place that's going to rock my world. || Whenever you get on the plane, the flight attendant will always tell you the name of your pilot. Like anyone goes, ""Oh, he's good."" || I never have kids in movies or in TV shows. || Life's a garden, dig it. || It's hard for your mom to tell you she has an oral fixation and has to have something in her mouth. My step dad is in the kitchen winking at me. You down with OPP, yeah you know me. Exciting is and a special... What? Easy, and why do you know all the words? That's weird. || It's funny because it's funny. || I'm just lucky to know someone that's that sweet and pretty. || I feel like I've got this anti-marriage thing, but it's less that and more I'm overthinking it to get it right."
David Steinberg,"When I got to stand-up, having seen Lenny Bruce when I was 17 or 18, I didn’t laugh at all at what he did, but I could not get over the storytelling aspect. They were concepts that challenged you. || Silences are the most underrated part of comedy. || He looks and talks like he just fell off Edgar Bergen's lap. || But this phenomenal thing happens - even though you are the same guy with the same script - when you have a producer attached. || On 'Curb Your Enthusiasm,' it takes almost a year to get 10 shows written. It always reminds me of my old yeshiva days, where you used to sit over a piece of Talmud and analyze everything that was going on. || In comedy, looking back is more important than looking around at your contemporaries because they are too much influenced by the same time period as you are. || I used to have a theory actually that, if you've had a good childhood, a good marriage and a little bit of money in the bank, you're going to make a lousy comedian. || Your relationship with an agent has got to be mutually beneficial. If you can't help their careers, then they're not going to be interested. || You don't need to be stable to be a stand-up comedian. || When I started, you didn't make a lot of money by being a comedian. You didn't get a lot of respect. || I rewrote it and I took all your notes. Read it again, that kind of persistence paid off. || I don't really dissect comedy. Nothing kills off humor more than overanalyzing it. || Comedians talk to other comedians the way jazz musicians can talk to each other. || A spontaneous interview feels differently than anything else you see on television. || I don't believe any particular ethnic group is smarter than any other group. || My father was a rabbi and had a little synagogue in Canada, so I'm from Canada. I left there at 16. || The thing about stand-ups is you can't really get good unless you're failing in front of a large number of people. That makes stand-up comedy unique: you need a tremendous amount of reserve within you to take the rejection from the audience, and without it, you can't do anything. || You can’t be comfortable in whatever that societal group is – kindergarten, school, basketball, whatever. You have to have an outsider point of view. || The one thing an audience always has in common with a comedian is troubles. The Yiddish word for that is tsuris. You're always putting your tsuris on stage whether you like it or not. No one is untroubled, unless they're just, you know, an imbecile. || The interesting thing about improvisation is you're making something up in front of the audience. Now music helps you out a little bit because you have an instrument that'll separate you from the audience. || Here's the rule that I set for myself, and I believe it - even on a show like 'Curb Your Enthusiasm': the more personal you are, the wider your audience. || My influences were Woody Allen and Lenny Bruce. || Being a lawyer in New York sucks because you're working eighty, sometimes a hundred hours a week. || The odd thing about comedy is that the more personal you are, the larger the audience. || I started writing this feature comedy in New York - a Chris Farley vehicle. The script was decent. When I got to LA, I met some new friends in film school and had them read my script and give me notes. || And it was a huge emotional thing to leave the law and become unemployed - to be a student again. || The worst thing that can happen to a comedian is to do a documentary on your life and you're watching it with an audience and there's not a laugh. || A lot of young people make the mistake of going into comedy just because it's a lucrative business, as opposed to earlier, even Steven and I, we were in 'Second City,' we never... thought of going beyond 'Second City' in Chicago. || The only reason I feel guilty about masturbation is because I do it so badly. || Once you succeed at something it’s hard to keep it fresh and exciting so you have to keep challenging yourself. You have to be a moving target or it won’t work. || Being a Jewish comic today is a lot different than it was years ago. In fact I changed my name from Dudy to David when I first started to make my name less ethnic. Years later, agents urged me to change my name to something shorter and less Jewish and I told them I had already done that. || Great Canadian comics are often outsiders and insiders at the same time. That's a great perspective for a comedian. || Today being a stand-up means that you have to throw them a joke, then another and then another and then follow up with some kind of storytelling. || We were the guys on the other side. It was hilarious. || When I talk to Steve Martin, he's joyful when he talks about comedy. || I starred in a Broadway play that was Sidney Poitier's first directing job and the cast was Lou Gossett, Cicely Tyson, Diana Ladd and I played a Jewish kid who offered himself as a slave to two Columbia University students as reparations. || I'm not a narcissistic vain comedian, but I like to tell a good story. || Jewish comics today are less jokey. Their humor comes at the end, rather than as in Vaudeville where the jokes came at you. || The whole idea of doing the Hollywood thing never even occurred to me. When you grow up on the East coast, Hollywood seems like this fantasy land and you don't think that people can actually make a living there. || There is no way to get better in stand up comedy than by failing. || I used to have a theory that I took almost through all the presidencies. And it was that you're either - it's like the Three Stooges. You're either a Moe, who's in charge, or a Larry, who wants to be a Moe, or you're Curly, who is nuts and totally just off the page. || You get to a philosophy after a while that everything is sort of cycling in a way. You know I have a sort of capsulized philosophy that your success is so relative. When you’re a baby success is not wetting your bed. When you’re a teenager success is going all the way. When you’re a young man success is making money. When you are middle aged success is being happy. When you’re an old man success is going all the way. And when you’re really old it’s not wetting your bed. || My father never lived to see his dream come true of an all-Yiddish-speaking Canada."
Demetri Martin,"I went into this salon in New York and I said “can I get a trim?” But it must have come out “gay Beatle please."" || Because the unexamined life is not worth living, man. || I think statues are great; they show what great people would look like if a bird shit all over them. || When they were naming the animals, somebody got lazy: anteater? What's it doing? It's eating ants. Done! || At the battle of the bands the loser's always the audience. || I didn't do improv in college, I never performed, I didn't do theater either. I was in student government, I was a history major. || At the battle of the bands the loser's always the audience. || I was stuck in traffic and I looked in the mirror and in the car behind me there was a couple having a horrible argument, and right below their image it said ""Objects In Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear"". I just thought, man I hope so because she was pretty mad. || I was watching MTV and there were girls dancing in suspended cages. That would be an ambivalent situation: ""I'm trapped! ...but enjoying the music"". || I didn't do improv in college, I never performed, I didn't do theater either. I was in student government, I was a history major. || 99.99% of all castles in America are located in fish tanks. || I have never been in a bad mood and near a beach ball at the same time. Causation? Correlation? Or fate? || I am bravery. I am courage. I am valor. I am daring. I am holding a thesaurus. || A Wednesday with no rain is a dry hump day. || I feel so fortunate to be one of the lucky ones who is so grateful and appreciative to know such great synonyms for thankful. || Halloween: the day each year when strangers give you even more specific reasons to dislike them based on what they are wearing. || Sometimes I see a bird fly by and I feel jealous. But then other times I see a bird fly into a closed window and I feel laughing. || When I am given a multiple choice test I choose not to take it. || To make a squirrel look less uptight, put tiny sunglasses on it. || Having a beard is a good way to make your face more susceptible to velcro. || Last week I lost my temper in my karate class. Man, I’m not doing that again until I’m a black belt. Because I can tell you there’s a difference between taking karate and receiving karate. || Don't talk to strangers. Sure, unless you want to meet anyone ever. || Suicide is the number one killer of a person who is in a boat and happens to be passing under a bridge at the wrong time. || I wish my name started with a comma. That would be so dramatic. || Swimming is a confusing sport, because sometimes you do it for fun, and other times you do it to not die. And when I'm swimming, sometimes I'm not sure which one it is. || I wonder what the word for dots looks like in Braille. || I'm excited to be here. I almost didn't do this show, because I have certain requests in order to do a benefit show. And I said, ""I'll do the show, but I need giant gay icicles behind me or I can't do it. I work with giant gay icicles or you can forget it."" It worked out, it's cool, so they make me look cool and a little less gay than the icicles themselves. || If I had a bookstore I would make all the mystery novels hard to find. || I never went bungee jumping. The closest I did was I was born. || If I live below a tap dancer I would just put really powerful magnets on the ceiling. We're not tapping shit now, are we? More of a tap stander. || I used to eat there all the time, but not so much anymore, not since the time I went to use their bathroom, and I saw a sign that said 'Employees Must Wash Hands, Especially Carl.' || I care about politics, but I have a tough time making comedy out of it. I was so happy to have a chance to be on The Daily Show, and I think Jon Stewart’s so funny… but mostly in my own comedy, I care about less relevant things. || I wanna make a jigsaw puzzle that's 40,000 pieces. And when you finish it, it says 'go outside.' || Is it hot in here, or are you just suffocating me in this relationship? || Employee of the month is a good example of how somebody can be both a winner and a loser at the same time. || I saw a transvestite wearing a T-shirt that said 'Guess'. || Another term for balloon is bad breath holder. || Let no man's deathbed be a futon. || I love Steven Wright. || I was making pancakes the other day and a fly flew into the kitchen. And that's when I realized that a spatula is a lot like a fly swatter. And a crushed fly is a lot like a blueberry. And a roommate is a lot like a fly eater. || To some I am known as Chief. And these are usually people who work in Radio Shack or try to sell me shoes. To others I am known as Buddy. These are people who dwell in bars and wonder if I’ve got a problem or what it is that I am ""looking at."" And to still others, who are in that same bar, standing just off to the side, I am ""Get Him!"" || There's an old Russian saying that goes some way or another. I don't know it. I don't speak Russian. But sometimes I think about it and wonder if it's relevant to what I'm going through at the time. Probably not. I mean what do Russian know about hunger, anyway? || I think a bad place for a fire would be the factory where they make those trick candles. || I have something called the ‘Who Gives A Shit Test’ that I apply to the things I’m talking about onstage. Like, most of my personal stories, people wouldn’t. Richard Pryor used to tell personal stories, and the audience would be completely rapt, but it’s really rare to be able to do that. || When you have a fat friend there are no see-saws, only catapults. || I want to commit a crime during a reenactment, and turn it into an enactment. || Cakes are the only food we write on. It’s always so encouraging like “Happy Birthday Leo,” “Congratulations Eric.” I feel like we’re missing an opportunity. I’m talking about negative cakes - “Surprise, You’re Adopted.” Cause that’s when you want cake. || I was eating some candy and looked on the wrapper, and it said ""made from natural and artificial flavors."" You could just say ""flavors."" || About a month ago I got a cactus. A week later, it died. I was really depressed because I was like, 'Damn! I am less nurturing than a desert.' || When I was a kid, I always wanted to live in California because I liked skateboarding. || I was student council president in high school, and even in law school, I was vice-president of the student bar association. || The shortest feedback loop I can think of is doing improvisation in front of an audience. || I wonder what the most intelligent thing ever said was that started with the word 'dude.' 'Dude, these are isotopes.' 'Dude, we removed your kidney. You're gonna be fine.' 'Dude, I am so stoked to win this Nobel Prize. I just wanna thank Kevin, and Turtle, and all my homies.' || I like video games, but they are very violent. I want to create a video game in which you have to help all the characters who have died in the other games. 'Hey, man, what are you playing?' 'Super Busy Hospital. Could you leave me alone? I'm performing surgery! This guy got shot in the head, like, 27 times!' || I wrapped my Christmas presents early this year, but I used the wrong paper. See, the paper I used said 'Happy Birthday' on it. I didn't want to waste it so I just wrote 'Jesus' on it. || If I ever saw bat shit, I’d be like, ‘that’s crazy.’ That's some crazy excrement right there. That looks like my ex-girlfriend's personality. || I like to use 'I Can't Believe it's Not Butter' on my toast in the morning, because sometimes when I eat breakfast, I like to be incredulous. How was breakfast? Unbelievable. || I go the gym and I try to run on the treadmill and I listen to music but it doesn't motivate me enough. So I'm going to get a recording of a pack of wolves gaining on me. People would be like, 'Why is that guy crying on that treadmill over there?' 'I don't know, but he's been yelling, 'help' for like 20 minutes. He's getting a good workout.' || Like a lot of people, I’ve always enjoyed commenting on strangers’ outfits. Unlike a lot of people, I now had a new megaphone to do it with. And, let me tell you, commenting on people’s hilarious clothing choices through a megaphone makes it so much better. || I find that at most theme parks, the theme is ‘Wait in Line, Fatty.’ || People and squirrels are very different. Most people will not argue that. But I find that there is one situation in which they're very similar. And that is: when I am driving towards them in my car. Then they're kind of hard to tell apart - especially if the human is kind of hairy. || My friend had a burrito. The next day he said, ""That burrito did not agree with me."" I was like, ""was the disagreement over whether or not you'd have diarrhea? Let me guess who won."" ""I tried to reason with it, I insisted, you know. I was like, ""I wanna go outside, I like these pants, but the burrito had his way."" || Some jokes are short and elegant, like a mathematical proof or a midget in a ball-gown. || If you remove a treehouse from a tree, than it's just a shitty house. Sometimes when i'm in a shitty house, I like to imagine that it's in a tree, than it's like ""Woah, this house is amazing.""  || I want to make a revolving door that says 'Pull' on it, just see how obedient people are. || Timing is everything. That’s a cliche. Now. If I’d said that a long time ago, I’d have been original. || We started to see less and less of each other. And that’s when I knew it was quicksand. || ""Finger Puppet"" sounds OK as a noun. || Hiking is just walking where it’s okay to pee. Sometimes old people hike by mistake. || I was having lunch with my friend. I said, 'Hey, what's your middle name.' He said, 'I have two middle names.' I said, 'Then you have no middle names. You have a space.' || Cinnamon buns, now - those are something I'd want to buy and have as a nickname. ""Excuse me, are you cinnamon buns?"" ""You bet your sweet ass I am."" || My friend Steve likes cats. People are always saying “Oh, Steve’s really a cat person”. No he’s not. If Steve were a cat person it’d be, like, “Hey, Steve never goes in the pool”. || Regarding the marching band: How much more interesting it would be to see a creeping band. || I like sports; I like professional football. I like to get to the stadium and see the games live, you know. And I paint my chest before I leave the house. But I don't have many friends, you know, so I usually just do punctuation and tack on a group already in progress. But sometimes it works out kind of weird because we ended up on TV one time and it said 'JETS?' || Small businesses are important, but so are tiny businesses. || For some reason ""cowboy"" sounds better than ""cowman"". || Mosquito bites Jesus, receives ""communion"". || If you want to dry hump someone you don’t know, just act like they were choking. || Turtles are greater than baby nephews, because it's ok to drop a turtle. || In America, one sure sign of success is the presence of an unnecessary waterfall in a person’s yard. || The other night I was playing twister with some amputees. || I am a ceiling fan, especially during rain. || The shortest distance between two idiots is a conga line. || There seems to be an extremely low probability that when I meet someone who has been described to me as “brassy” that I will like this person, even a little bit. || The lord works in mysterious ways. Indeed. And a shorter way to say that is: God is a sneak. || Sometimes it looks like I’m dancing, but it’s just that I walked into a spider web. || It would be interesting if Elvis were reincarnated as an Elvis impersonator. || I heard this guy say ""Man, I need to get some R&R"" I was like ""wow, this guy's tired, he doesn't even have the energy to say... Est and Elaxation"" ""Dude i gotta get two R's, I'll explain later."" ""Rabbits and retards? What does this guy want?"" ""Nah, he's sleeping, we'll find out later"" ""Okay"" || When someone shows you a picture of their kids what they don't want to hear is ""Oh, yeah, I got pictures of your kid too."" || Do you believe in love at first sight? How about misery in 3 years? || You need an audience to help you figure out what’s working and what’s worth putting on your album or your special - or even just what’s worth touring with. || My friend named his car. And I don't want to be judgemental, but... what a dork. || I got myself a really nice nib pen, with like 15 kinds of India Ink, and tons of different nibs; I think I was just procrastinating, like, once I have the right nib, the book is just going to jump right out of my fingertips… but then it just ended up looking like the shitty drawings that I usually do. || How many of you are creative? I don’t know, but for me, when you make a bunch of things over time and then you keep them… you forget. I look through my sketchbooks and I’m an audience for myself. || I think they should put pies on the fronts of trains, so that when they hit something it's at least a little bit funny. || I was in a restaurant that had a sign that said 'Restrooms For Customers Only'... I thought, it must suck to work there. || When I’m buying car insurance I ask myself, ‘Which company has the most annoying and relentless commercials?’ || I remember when I used to be really into nostalgia. || I feel like my washing machine is sneaky because I put clothes in there and detergent and start it up. I hear all this noise as it’s turning around, then I open the lid to see what was going on and it’s like... ""What man? We’re just hanging out in here. There’s nothing happening? Don’t worry about it. I’m a washing machine, not a show you how I do it machine."" || I’ve met a few people who were passive-aggressive, but I’ve never met anyone who was aggressive-passive. ""I don’t want tacos! Maybe."" || When they were naming vitamins they must have thought there were going to be way more vitamins than there ended up being. OK let's name these: Vitamin A, Vitamin B... Ok, man, slow down, we've got a lot to cover here. B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B12. Then they got to E and they were like 'We're pretty much done. We've got all those damn B's. This is embarrassing. Let's just skip to K and get the hell out of here. || I think they named oranges before they named carrots. 'What are these?' 'Those are orange: oranges.' 'What about these?' 'Oh, shit. Long pointies? We'll go by shape now?' || I'm in a weird situation 'cause I like rainbows, but I'm not gay. So I wear a rainbow on my shirt, but then under it I gotta put 'Not Gay.' But I'm not against gay people, so then under that I gotta put 'But Supportive.' I just think it's weird that one group took refracted light. That's pretty greedy, gays. || When someone describes themselves as a taxpayer, they’re about to be an asshole. || I don’t know what the long form of OK is. I wanna think it’s okie dokie. ‘I’m okie dokie. I’m a little shaken up, but I’m okie dokie.’ ‘The good news is, she’s okie dokie. The surgery went fine.’ || I was eating some pizza and I burnt the roof of my mouth. Then I thought, “wait a minute, this is the ceiling of my mouth.” || Every pizza is a personal pizza if you try hard and believe in yourself. || Clothing sizes are weird, they go: small, medium, large and then extra large, extra extra large, extra extra extra large. Something happened at large, they just gave up. They were like, 'I'm not doing any more adjectives; you just keep putting extras on there.' We could do better than that: small, medium, large, whoa, easy, slow down, stop it, interesting, American. || “I heard this lady say “I love kids.” That’s nice, a little weird though. It’s like saying “I like people, for a little while.” “How old are you? 14? Fuck off!” You can say “I love kids” as a general statement, that’s fine. It’s when you get specific that you get in to trouble. “I love twelve-year-olds.” || I think it’s weird when you give someone flowers… Really saying here you go, now watch these die, cause I like you. I feel like you should give someone flowers if you want to threaten them, here you’re next. Better put your feet in water 'cause I’m coming for you. || If someone asks you if you're ticklish, it doesn't matter if you say yes or no. They want to touch you. If someone asks you if you're ticklish and you do not want to be touched, say something like 'I have diarrhea. And yes, I am very ticklish.' || I think a treehouse is really insensitive. That's like killing something and then making one of its friends hold it. || When you’re having sex with somebody, you can say “yes”, you can say “yeah”, you can say “uh-huh.” But for some reason you can’t say “yep”. Yep, oh, yep, baby. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep indeed! || Some authors write in first person and others write in third person. But I'm writing my book in fifth person, so every sentence starts out with: 'I heard from this guy who told somebody....' || I like to stand near ATM machines, and when somebody types in their pin number, I go, 'Got it!' And then I run away. || A power nap is when you sleep on someone who's weaker than you. || Laborers want their kids to be merchants or business people. Business people want their kids to be professionals. Professionals want their kids to be academics, professors. Academics want their kids to be artists. And artists don’t care if their kids are laborers or not. They can be anything. || I wish I lived next to Carnegie Hall. Then, if someone asked me how to get to my house, I would just say ‘Practice, practice, practice, and then take a left.’ || I think the best thing about being dumb is that it makes magic a lot better. Where the hell did that rat come from? I dunno, but I’m calling the cops because he just cut that lady in half. || I don't like pinatas because the pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals. || My friend has hand soap that smells like coconut. It's nice, unless your hands are dirty from coconuts. Then it's the worst soap possible. || I like when good things happen to me, but I wait two weeks to tell anyone because I like to use the word 'fortnight.' || I think vests are all about protection. You know what I mean? Like a lifevest protects you from drowning and bulletproof vests protect you from getting shot and the sweatervest protects you from pretty girls. Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm cold just right here? || A dreamcatcher works, if your dream is to be gay. || Automatic paper towel dispensers are a solution to something that was never a problem in the first place. || I noticed that there are no B batteries. I think that's to avoid confusion, cause if there were you wouldn't know if someone was stuttering. 'Yes, hello I'd like some b-batteries.' 'What kind?' 'B-batteries.' 'What kind?' 'B-batteries!' and D-batteries that's hard for foreigners. 'Yes, I would like de batteries.' || When I was in high school I experimented sexually. The experiment was to never have sex with anybody no matter how hard I tried. Success! Hypothesis confirmed. || The ""earth"" without ""art"" is just ""eh."" || How fast does a zebra have to run before it looks grey? || A sports bar is a way to take a bar and fill it with even more annoying people than usual. || I wish they would just call the news: What's Wrong. 'Hi, it's six o'clock, here's What's Wrong. Now for the local news, here's the worst shit that happened the closest to you.' || I saw a door onetime that said “Exit Only.” So I entered it, and I went up to the guy working there and said, “I have some good news. You have severely underestimated this door here. By like 100%, man.” || I learned this summer that peeing in the pool and peeing INTO the pool are very different things. Location, Location, Location. || Surprise parties are strange 'cause people jump up and they yell the word, 'surprise' at the party. I came home and you emerged from my furniture. You don't have to tell me how to feel. I don't need a hint. || I saw a guy at a party wearing a leather jacket and I thought, ""That is cool"". But then I saw another guy wearing a leather vest and I thought, ""That is not cool"". Then I figured it out: Cool is all about leather sleeves. || I like rock, paper, scissors - two-thirds. Rock breaks scissors: these scissors are bent, they're destroyed, I can't cut stuff - I lose. Scissor cuts paper: this is strips, this is not even paper, this can take me forever to put this back together - you got me. Paper covers rock: rock is fine, no structural damage to rock. Rock can break through paper at any point, just say the word. Paper sucks. It should be rock, dynamite with a cuttable wick, scissors. || When a Dalmatian sees a cow he must be like, 'What the hell happened to him? I am high right now. That dalmatian is fat and smeary.' When the cow sees the Dalmatian he must be like, 'He looks amazing. I am so out of shape, this is ridiculous. My tits are on the ground here.' || Checkers taught me that a King is a man with another man on top of him. But life taught me that that's actually called a Queen. || I saw a sign that said, ‘Watch for children.’ I was like, ‘That sounds like a fair trade - especially if they’re crappy kids.’ || Earrings are the same as sneezes: Two is okay, but ten in a row is annoying. If you have two then, God bless you. || When I first heard the term 'training bra,' I was freaked out. I was pretty young and I said, 'Did you just say training bra? They're training their chests? I had no idea.' See some lady, her boobs are everywhere. 'What's her deal?' Those are untrained titties. || I went into a clothes store and a lady came up to me and said ""if you need anything, I'm Jill"". I've never met anyone with a conditional identity before. || Graffiti. I don’t like graffiti, unless it teaches me something, you know? Like “Oh, that’s how Alex feels about Maria. I wouldn’t have known if I had not walked by there, thank you.” Graffiti’s the most passionate literature there is, you know? It’s always like “Bush sucks!”, “U2 Rocks!”. I want to make indifferent graffiti. “Toy Story 2 was okay!” “I like Sheryl as a friend, but I’m not sure about taking things further”, “This is a bridge!”, “That guy’s right!” || I went snorkeling on vacation aka surprise drinking a lot of water through a big straw. || One of my favorite clothing patterns is camouflage. Because when you're in the woods it makes you blend in. But when you're not it does just the opposite. It's like ""hey, there's an asshole."" || The straw is a great invention. You can drink without using your wrists. The straw is your friend until you lose eye contact with the straw. Then he will betray you and make you look like an idiot. I have to pull the straw aside and be like “What the hell do you think you’re doing? The last time I checked, you were right by my mouth. What are you doing on the other side of the glass? I don’t need you; you’re a luxury."" || I don’t know why great abs are considered attractive. I know they are, but biologically, I don’t know what we’re trying to convey. You see a guy with great abs, you think, ‘wow! That guy could shit really fast.’ I bet women love that. || I am a man of my word… and that word is ""unreliable."" || I was in a card store and they had cards that said 'Get Well Soon.' Fuck that - get well now. || It's Thursday and it really feels like a Thursday. Sometimes things just work out. || The comedians I liked were Bill Cosby and Steven Wright, like just always as a comedic actor. I always liked Gary Larson, who's really funny for a cartoonist, obviously. || Jumping jacks are easier to do than crawling jacks. || To look like you are a real sports fan, when there is a game on TV just yell, ""Oh, come on!"" every now and then at the TV. || If you are asked to describe a suspect to a police sketch artist, describe in precise detail, the features of the police sketch artist. This is one of the rare instances where two people can do one self-portrait. || ""Yes"" actually means ""No"" 100% of the time, when the question is ""Can I give you some advice?"" || I am the Walrus, but not the one you're probably thinking of. I am the other Walrus, the one who is less the Walrus in the sense of legendary music and more the Walrus in the sense of his tendency to to lie around in places for too long. || I was in a store and I saw a pocket dictionary and that made me laugh because it's such a specific item. I don't know that many words, and I'm going out... and I have pants. Perfect! || Siamese twins are interesting because they are the only people who can write a biography and an autobiography at the same time. || There is also a beast, a beast of strange dimensions. He has the head of a horse and the body of a man who needs a lot of attention. He represents me in college: I was a dork-ataur. || I saw a dog wearing a sweater and I thought that looked ridiculous 'cause dogs don't have arms. If you're going to put clothes on the dog, you should put two pairs of pants on it. || On Thursday, I changed the names of all my fish, and they didn't seem to mind - especially Dead Tony. || Sometimes heckling can almost help a set, because it ratchets up the tension in the room… can even bring things to a climax. || I still like paper books. Like, book is a flammable object. After you read it, you could use it to get warm. Or it could become a pile of napkins. || 100% of the people who give 110% do not understand math. || The question is, ‘how bad at sports were you as a kid?’ I grew up near where they film Jersey Shore. If you weren’t tan, muscular, and book-averse, you were a dork and a nerd and a geek and stuff. I remember being into Gary Larsen, Stephen Wright, Peter Sellers… || I have an erratic drummer for anybody who's just listening to this, he can keep time, but just in spurts. || I was in my friends garage, and he had; a kite, a yo-yo, and a boomerang. I was like ""Dude, you have abandonment issues"". || I like when people wear a WWJD bracelet, because it’s like an example of the first thing Jesus wouldn’t do, probably. || I didn’t know angels flew this close to the ground. Maybe that’s because this angels gained a few pounds since we started going out. || I was at the mall the other day, looking for a job, girlfriend, pretzel. || A parade looks like a bunch of people are excited about being in traffic. || Bowling would be more interesting if it were slightly uphill. || Sometimes I feel like I’m being watched, but then I remember that my show was canceled three years ago. || Cotton candy is the perfect snack for when I’m in the mood to eat dry, scratchy fabric. || I love having an open seat next to me on the train. What’s even better is when my seat is open too because I just stayed home. || Canoe plus waterfall equals ""I don't go camping anymore"". || Multi-Choice question: My dishwasher is: efficient; hilarious. || I thought I would, you know, go to college, get to law school, finish, and then get a job and work as a lawyer, but that proved to be not a good fit for me. || But what I was going to say was, I just figured I'm going to go boldly in the direction of my dreams, say it as Thoreau would say, and just see where it takes me. || I wanna see a snake eat spaghetti. || There’s a very fine line between giving someone the Heimlich maneuver and dry-humping a stranger. || I can move objects with my mind if I use my hands. || Separate but equal is terrible for education but it's perfect for eyebrows. || I hadn’t been to the beach since the summer the synchronized swimming team drowned. It was tragic yet beautiful. Apparently the lead got a cramp and they were pretty hardcore. || ""I"" equals all of the ""ifs"" added up over time. The ""ifs,"" those are the possibilities; that’s infinite for all of us. Every day there are just millions of them. Time, that’s finite for each of us; there is no question there. Maybe if you divide ""choices"" by the amount of time you have, the real ""I"" can emerge, depending upon those choices. || I like birthdays because we celebrate life with cakes. It's so cool. Sometimes when I see a baby, I'm like that much more cake in the world. But then when someone dies, I'm like the cake streak is over... || I used to play sports. Then I realized you can buy trophies. Now I am good at everything. || If I ever saw an amputee getting hanged, I'd probably just start calling out letters. || The easiest time to add insult to injury is when you're signing somebody's cast. ""You're a dick! You deserved this! Also I'm sorry I broke your leg."" || I love catching a snapshot of something that is just about to happen. Or maybe something that just happened, you know. But I like especially that just-before kind of feeling. || I've learned something on the road, traveling around: state shapes. The easier it is to draw the shape of the state, the harder it is to live in that state. So, if you live in a regular polygon, get the hell outta there. You gotta move to a squiggly area. Culture's attracted to squiggles. || I'm so secretive that when someone asks me, ""Hey, can you keep a secret?"" I say ""That's none of your business."" || Brought to you by raising your voice. The next best thing to being right. || A squirrel is the same as a can, when there’s a bb gun in my hand. Can’t you see that I am just a man? With distinctions… and comparisons. || I think that when you get dressed in the morning, sometimes you're really making a decision about your behavior for the day. Like if you put on flipflops, you're saying: 'Hope I don't get chased today.' 'Be nice to people in sneakers.' || If you can't tell a spoon from a ladle, then you're fat! || I am completely attracted to the idea of simplicity, or at least removing things that seem unnecessary when trying to get an idea out there. || I think it's interesting that 'cologne' rhymes with 'alone.' || Nothing wise was ever printed upon an apron. || I never set out to do a sketch show. || Stand-up is like a row boat: it's fun and romantic when you're choosing to do it. But if you have no other choice than to be in a row boat it's not as enjoyable; that's survival. || I like to go to concerts because I love to see my favourite band through the phone of the asshole who’s standing on front of me. || The planets. Now footnote, I’m including Pluto in the planets, because I think it’s terrible what they did to Pluto. And it’s still a planet to me. I grew up with Pluto as a planet, it will always be a planet. || There is probably more invisible tape out there than we realize. || When the stripper jumped out of the giant cake, everyone got excited. But then when she jumped into the regular-size cake, everyone got confused. || What's this about rice milk? I didn't even know rice had nipples! || Whenever I investigate a smell, I find that the answer is always bad. It's never: ""What is that? Muffins!"" || One time I saw two geese fighting and I thought, this is a pillow fight, ahead of time. || Whenever I'm on my computer, I don't type 'lol'. I type 'lqtm' - laugh quietly to myself. It's more honest. || A drunk driver is very dangerous. So is a drunk backseat driver if he's persuasive. ""Dude, make a left."" ""Those are trees. Trust me."" || Game, set, match equals tennis. Set, match, run equals arson. || I've heard of many chocoholics, but I ain't never seen no ""chocohol"". We got an epidemic, people: people who like chocolate but don't understand word endings. They're probably ""over-workaholled"". || Skiing is my favorite sport, because, that's the only sport that is actually better to watch the worst the person is at it. ""That guy won a gold medal in the Olympics."" ""Oh yeah, that's cool, I wanna watch the fat guy."" ""Come on dude, you can take that hill."" || There are two kinds of jackets - reversible, and reversible but it’s hard to zipper up and it looks really stupid. || My credit card company says I have an outstanding balance. I'm flattered. || It’s hard to know what’s gay in life. Boxing. That’s two men fighting over a belt. || When I trip, I feel like that’s the world saying ""come here for a second."" It just pulls me closer for a second, ""yeah what do you want?"" ""I just want to remind you that you’re uncoordinated."" ""I’m aware of that, thank you... can I go now?"" ""Yeah, you can go, but never ever try to outrun me."" ""Ok, world, see you later."" ""Yeah, I’ll see you in about 50 years."" || An easy way to sound like a creep is to add the word ‘ladies’ to the end of things you say. It can be harmless too, but it just makes you a creep. ‘Yeah after college I spent two years in the peace corps, ladies?’ The more harmless it is, the more of a creep you become. ‘I broke my arm. I need help, ladies?’ || My favorite fruit is grapes. Because with grapes, you always get another chance. 'Cause, you know, if you have a crappy apple or a peach, you're stuck with that crappy piece of fruit. But if you have a crappy grape, no problem - just move on to the next. 'Grapes: The Fruit of Hope.' || A musical is the same as a burlap sack, I would not want to be in either. || Tic Tacs are the maracas of breath mints. || My friend’s really into similes. He uses a lot of similes. He’s like annoying. || The key to life is balance, especially if you are on a ledge. || Overheard today in restaurant: ""Can you stop listening to our conversation?"" || A yacht is a good of example of how an object can be an arrogant prick. || If you are wearing a bandana you better have something wise to say, because you are starting with a credibility deficit. || Parades are man's attempt to make traffic exciting. || When people show me pictures of their kids, it's okay. But when I give them a picture of me, to show to their kids, I'm weird. What kind of one way street is that? || 4 in every 8 math teachers think that they should be 1 in every 2 math teachers. || I think it's cool when an ex-girlfriend becomes an XL girlfriend. || If you’re a battery, you’re either working or you’re dead… it’s a shit life. || I am what I eat. And I am this especially when I bite my nails. || If you drink enough beer, everything turns in to a bed. || You never get a second chance at a first impression. || The problem with my balloon collection is that people always think there’s a party. ""Settle down. It’s not a party. It’s just balloons."" || Hey, is there a new critically acclaimed movie called “Other People”? Because that’s what I want to see. || The plastic knife is perfect for when a person just wants to make some marks on his food and get insanely frustrated at the same time. || If you happen to catch on fire during the show, do not panic or wave your arms around or scream or we wil give something to panic and wave you arms around and scream about. || I am sometimes referred to as Excuse Me in an annoyed tone of voice, because apparently I am in the way. I am so sorry. I am supposed to be some sort of mind reader, I guess. I am moving out of the way now as slowly as I possibly can. I am doing this and there’s nothing you can do about it. || I am everything and I am nothing. I am just kidding; I am not everything and nothing. That would be ridiculous. I am just everything. || As soon as I jumped out of the airplane, I realized I had forgotten my parachute. Thank God we were still on the runway. || A lot of things look cooler in slow motion. Eating isn't one of them. || I never give anyone just one congratulation. Congratulations are always plural. They are similar to grapes. || I think cats would have an even worse attitude if they found out how stupid their names were. || Someday I will tell my grandchildren that I lived in the era when ""OK"" was abbreviated to ""K"". || When watering your plants, try to talk to them - say something like, ""Hold it right there"" and then shoot them with water gun. || Right before I'm about to talk at length about something I like I say, ""Get me started."" || It is impossible for a cyclops to wink. || To remove blood stains from your conscience try frozen margaritas. || Americans who do not celebrate Independence Day: pets. || Use crazy glue and nails to turn a rocking chair into just a chair that looks like a rocking chair. || If you want to feel less sexy put scotch tape on your nipples. || I find that a shirt is most similar to a napkin when I don't have a napkin. || When I am at rodeo I find it difficult not to root for the animals. || Planning trip around the globe, that is in my room. || When I am holding a water balloon, so many things look so unnecessarily dry. || I have an air mattress. It's great because if someone tries to suffocate me in bed I can just poke a hole in it and use it to stay alive. || I think one of the most groundbreaking inventions of all time is the jackhammer. || Specifically in stand-up, I love jokes. I love short, structured ideas and a punchline. || And my only rule being if when I wake in the morning I'm looking forward to the things that I have to do that day, then I'm on the right track. || And of course I didn't make any money from stand up for years, so I had temp jobs. That was the way I made money. || I think a lot of stuff I find funny is from day dreaming. || And as far as actors go, Peter Sellers is my all-time favorite. || But I found that disappointing people is a good thing, because disapproval is freedom. || I have fun acting, and I want to do more of it, and I want to direct my own movie. || I just know keeping track of what I'm doing and where I'm going is important to me. || I know about Woodstock probably as much as your average person who is over 30, where I'd know Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Grateful Dead. || I started being a comedy fan when I was, I'm going to guess, like 5 or 6 years old. || I think since I was kid people told me that they thought I was funny. || I think, at first blush, the '60s always enticed me. There's something about the '60s, it's not hard to like it. || People only have so much attention. || To me, comedy is a game. || Usually, I walk around and think about things. When I come across a thought that makes me laugh, I write it down. || It's very easy to go through your whole life and never really get anything done or have any real meaningful interactions or relationships. All of a sudden you're dead, and I'm going to say that's got to be a letdown. || Okay, so, when I was a kid, definitely the drawings and the illustration. Then I stopped in sixth grade or so.

I want to be my own colleague. || A glove is a very literal looking hand puppet. || To let people know how quirky and interesting you are try wearing your pajama pants to the supermarket, you fucking slob. || If I had to pick one artist to tile my bathroom I would go with MC Escher. || Dogs seem more photogenic than cats. In photos most cats look like sociopaths. || Sometimes It feels like the world is just being mean, like when it’s windy out. I’ll just be walking down the street and it’s like the world saying to me ""Hey, you like air? Yeah? Yeah? You need that to breathe? Here’s some fucking air right in your face, there you go. Breathe up, stupid."" || A human head looks the least scary when it is attached. || Vampires probably don't have great breath. || I’m not a lawmaker, but I was thinking that if you have a really loud ring tone, maybe you should be stabbed in the ear? || Skeet shooting is probably more satisfying if you really hate skeets. || I would like to have windshield wipers that do the whole windshield, please. || If you have a lip ring try hanging some tiny keys from it. This will make you look even more interesting. || I'm always excited to try something I haven't done. || I've seen a lot of proud sponsors of things; I'd like to see a reluctant sponsor. 'Subaru - reluctant sponsor of the WNBA.' || I love women, but I feel like you can't trust some of them. Some of them are liars, you know? Like I was in the park and I met this girl, she was cute and she had a dog. And I went up to her, we started talking. She told me her dog's name. Then I said, 'Does he bite?' She said, 'No.' And I said, 'Oh yeah? Then how does he eat?' Liar. || I think bears and worms aren’t very similar… until you think of gummy. || I just found something in my hair. That’s never a good thing. It’s never gonna be, like, a treat. || I was walking in the park and this guy waved at me. Then he said, 'I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else.' I said, 'I am.' || I like fruit baskets because it gives you the ability to mail someone a piece of fruit without appearing insane. Like, if someone just mailed you an apple you'd be like, 'huh? What the hell is this?' But if it's in a fruit basket you're like, 'this is nice!' || For example, I was a White House intern the summer before I dropped out of law school. Everybody knew about it. I'd come home and go to church and everybody would say, 'Oh, my God. Demetri, you're working at the White House.' || Cottonballs are an example of something I’d want to buy, but not have as a nickname. || Leave no stone unturned in your quest to disrupt a rock garden. || I lost my fog machine 'cause I left it running for too long. I don't know how fog got associated with partying. 'This weather is way too dangerous to drive in. You guys want to dance?' || Are your feet tired?.. Because you’ve been stomping on my dreams for a few years now. || A pipe is greater than a bong. Because when you’re smoking a pipe at least it makes you look like you’re thinking about something. || A cool tattoo design is any drawing that would also look good saggy. || I'm a body builder, but I don't use weights. I use snacks. It's kind of a different building process. || Don’t forget to turn your clocks back today if you don’t want your clocks to be set to the right time. || Cut me off, I’ll curtsy on your ass. || Coffee is like a bra. 3 cups is one too many. || It’s not enough to say ""I’m sorry"". You have to also mean it. It’s the same with saying ""I’m single"". || Yes, okay, it’s cool to be quirky, maybe, on the side. Do some puzzles, make puzzles, whatever, learn how to ride a unicycle. That’s cool when it’s on the side and you have a plan. What happens when you remove the plan? What you’re left with is a guy who likes to do anagrams. And doesn’t have a job… Sweet, that’s a catch. || I think it would be worse to get mauled by a dancing bear than just a regular bear because you can't totally blame the dancing bear. || The sofa is the enemy of productivity. || Knights would have probably liked refrigerator magnets. || They say it's lonely at the top.

Which is great, because I was getting really tired of holding things while I slept. || Wind chimes are also earthquake chimes. || Statistics indicate that the average American is a guy named Brian who lives in Ohio. || A refrigerator is the opposite of a drug addict, because a refrigerator starts in a box and then moves to a house. || The worst time to have a heart attack is during a game of charades. || I wish rabbits had big earlobes. || It is interesting that the black BMW is the preferred car of so many assholes. || It would be nice if people said, ""God bless you"" not just when you sneezed but also when you farted. || That shirt looks good on you. You know what else would look good on you? My friend Dave, I think you should go out with him. || When I’m with you I feel 3 pounds lighter. Probably because you bore the shit out of me... And I had a big lunch. || Hey I was just wondering. Are you doing push ups with your knees down? Because I’m not sure if this is working out. || If only loud people were even half as interesting as they think they are. || Hey, is there a new critically acclaimed movie called “Other People”? Because that’s what I want to see. || Everybody knew that you should never provoke a rattlesnake, much less tie it into a bow. But that didn’t stop Judd. What did stop him was the rattlesnake. || I was thinking how strange it is that water is one of the best, simplest things on this planet, and still with a simple glass of water you can neutralize so many of the greatest technological advances that we provide. Like with my blackberry, I can get in touch with so many people, but if I dip it in a small glass of water I’m completely disconnected. || Tough guys tend to be curious. “What are you looking at?” “Do you have a problem?” “Would you like to step outside?” “What are books?"" || Have a great day.

I am the other Walrus, the one who is less the Walrus in the sense of legendary music and more the Walrus in the sense of his tendency to lie around in places for too long. || I think my favorite sound is the sound of someone not playing the bongos. || Fire truck with back end on fire drives really fast in circles. || You get really disillusioned, because you thought you were in love. But you realize that you’re just alone. || The best way to make somebody feel important is to try to assassinate them. || I don't have to kill myself, time is going to do that. || Everything I ever learned I was told by someone else. || I hate you, but I'm not in hate with you. || I am often the one they call “You,” but I am no more “You” than you. I am me. And yet I am more “Me” than you are me or can ever be. || P equals the amount of pizza there is. Divided by me plus my friends. Which always comes out to one less than the amount of slices I want to eat. And that equals… bullshit. || The Pursuit of Happiness: It sure seems to like a good chase, doesn’t it? || The reason you often get in comedy is because you’re not getting laid. || I can tell how lonely I am by how easily I’m fooled by a mannequin in a store. || There is no ""I"" in ""Team"", unless you count the vertical part of the ""T"". || If you stretched the average person’s intestines out from end to end, it would make them scream a lot. || We do not allow dwarf tossing. If you toss a dwarf, the dwarf will be tossed right back at you, but faster. || There are very few songs about just liking someone as a friend. || Drunken behavior will not be tolerated, except by those who are being hilarious. || Count your blessings, but not out-loud, at the top of your lungs. || On a scale of 1 to 10 I give scales of 1 to 10 a 3. || I think it would be frustrating to be a match maker.

The other day I spilled the jar.

Makes sense, I guess. || I can turn a towel into a beach towel just by bringing it to the beach. I can also do a similar thing with a bum. || One time I saw an old man in a hurry and I thought, ‘That makes sense.’ || I wonder if there were any goths in gothic times. They’re like: You look completely appropriate. You don’t look stupid or lonely at all. || But long story short, I didn't start doing stand-up because I wanted to have a TV show or be an actor or even wanted to write sketch comedy. I got into stand-up because I love stand-up. || Stand up is really fun because if I think of a joke or a funny idea, then I can just go and tell some people and if they laugh, they laugh right away. || A know-it-all is a person who knows everything except for how annoying he is. || It is illegal to yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater. If there is a fire, please yell something else instead, like ""Flames!"" or ""Smoke maker!"" or ""Bad hot!"" || Never be less interesting than your refrigerator magnets. || Socrates became a trendsetter.

And, for centuries after that there would be countless imitators including oltaire, Michelangelo, and, much later, Cher. || I was an ""Omnivore."" Like a lot of people, I didn't know any better. Then I read a couple of books. One of them was called How Chickens Are Raped Before You Eat Them. Another was called Hotdogs and Fingertips. I also read The Cow Feces Dilemma as well as Barf, STDs and Veal. || They say that you can tell man apart from other animals by his ability to reason. I think you could also go by last names.

""Hey boss, can I help you, boss?"" When they call me boss, I go, ""I got some bad news… I’m gonna have to let you go, but first bring me the earnings from the register for today. I’ll give you severance, and give me the rest."" || I’ve never read an article of clothing. || I used to get bummed out when it rained; then I realized that it's God's way of washing off hippies. || You are ten times more likely to get hit by a car when the driver is aiming for you. || After going through years of litigation to get royalties due to him, the guy who coined the term ‘happily ever after’ lived reasonably well for a while. || You never forget your first kiss.

But I don't understand why they say that. Why is spinning the way that a corpse shows disapproval? || It’s so beautiful outside, I’m thrilled you guys took the time to come inside. On my tour for my first book, this was my favorite stop. For real. I’m not even kissing you guys’ asses. || I call it ‘new forms’.

I try to think of different things to divvy up the show, like doing drawings, playing music… I gotta carry the show, that’s the problem. || I don’t think I ever wrote a song. I can write a lot of jokes, but when I try to write lyrics they’re the most direct, non-figurative words, like, ‘I like you, I like you,’… and that’s it, for the whole song. People would go, ‘Ooh, this guy’s Dylan or something.' It gives me a lot more respect for songwriters, actually. || I hate seeing people that look like you. Especially if God's living by the motto 'If at first you don't succeed'. || The boomarang is Australia’s chief export, and then import. || You know what's the greatest part of anything ever in the history of everything?

The children working in sweatshops make the clothes. Therefore, the children working in sweatshops make the man. || My friend asked me I ever swam with dolphins. I was like, ‘Yeah, of course. What distance are we talking about from the dolphins? Because the last time I was in the ocean, I’m pretty sure I swam with most of them.’ || Your mind is like a sponge, in the sense that it would come in handy when cleaning off a countertop or something like that. || I don't usually fly in first class, but I fart in first class. || Most stick people are black. || My plumbing is all screwed up. Because it turns out, I do not own a garbage disposal. || A lot of people like lollipops. I don't like lollipops. To me, a lollipop is hard candy plus garbage. I don't need a handle. Just give me the candy. || It was my friend's birthday and I was mad at him, so I sent him a card. It said happy birthday, but I put quotes around the word ""'Happy""... sarcastic birthday, douche bag. || Hey baby, are you being followed?..

And then I went outside and I had to get a cab, so I had to put up one of my hands. But I already started eating my sandwich; I took it out of the bag, I was impatient. So my choice was hold up an egg sandwich or hold up a hot chocolate to get a car. So I chose the hot chocolate. And I put it up there and no cab stopped and I realized it was because I looked like I was toasting traffic. Standing on the street, ‘Here’s to you guys, to everybody heading west, I just wanna say I like what you do… but one of you needs to stop, pick me up.’ || You should never leave a note on a sleeping bum, even if you were clearly just trying to be supportive. || I wonder if it’s rude for a deaf person to talk with food in their hands. || Why are there not positive mysteries? It’s always ""who stole the diamond"", or ""who killed the butler""? How about... ""who made cookies"", ""somebody cleaned my room"". || It seems that man's greatest natural enemy is the target. || An ex-girlfriend is the same as an okay movie. I liked it at the time, but I don’t really want to see it again. Especially if the movie was kind of… a bitch. || Those that say their glasses are half-full are considered optimists. Yeah, but shouldn't we be more specific about the contents of the glass? If it's a glass of shit, I'm going half-empty. I don't like shit as an optimist. ""Yeah, we gotta half-empty shit glass right here."" || When telling a story about how wasted you were last night, stop. || You always hear about the guy who was raised by wolves. You never hear about the guy who was raised by the guy who was raised by wolves. The problem is, you have a non-wolf imparting wolf teachings. || I hate when I go in for a handshake, I’m coming in traditional, I’m showing you my hand and the person comes back at me with like the fist thing and then I got to scramble, like upgrade, oh so we’re doing the fist. Okay like cause yours is new I go to do your thing. So I don’t do it, I just go like, paper covers rock bitch. || I was in a shoe store and the guys call me boss, and I said, ""Ya, can I just get those sneakers in a 10?"" And uh, he said, ""Okay"" and then he went down stairs. He came back and he said, ""I don't have a 10, I have a 9."" ""Oh great, because while you were downstairs, my toes were severed, so that works out. Normally it would be stupid for you to tell me a number different than the one I said, 'cause it goes with my body part. But given my very recent accident, you're right on. I'll take the 9's and a pile of band-aids, thank you. You're re-hired 'cause you're a genius. || When I stub my toe it's like I pressed a button that plays all the curse words I know. || I went to law school. I found it interesting for the first three weeks. || There's a saying that goes, 'People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.' OK. How about, 'Nobody should throw stones'? That's crappy behavior. My policy is, 'No stone throwing regardless of housing situation.' || I like parties, but I don't like pinatas because the pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals. Hey, there's a donkey with some pizzazz. Let's kick its ass. What I'm trying to say is, don't make the same Halloween costume mistake that I did. || A large portion of the Earth’s land area is taken up by old varsity jackets. || One thing you never hear is ""Man that guy is good at badminton."" || At any minute, I am four minutes from a poncho. || Do you have any Greek in you? That was just a tactful way of asking if you’re pregnant. If you’re not, then let’s break up. || Here is a tip for all you young people drinking wine. With pasta, drink white wine. With steak, drink red wine. And if you're vegan, you're annoying. || Never forget where you came from. That's what I think when I walk into a cave. || The definition of ""adventure"" depends upon how boring your life is. || Whenever I throw caution to the wind I make sure I’m facing the right way so that it doesn’t blow back and hit me in my face. || A Rubik’s cube is equal to a drag queen. It’s really colorful, but I don’t wanna do it. || Reality is a concept that depends largely upon where you point your face. || I think the best thing to keep in a safe is a note that says “Nice try, asshole."" || I live in New York and there are a lot of famous... pizzerias in my neighborhood, it's really hard to find one that isn't famous. Which sucks sometimes, you know what I mean, sometimes I don't want all that glitz and glamour, I just want something delicious, you know? I don't need a celebrity in my mouth, ""Ray's Up And Coming Pizza"" would be fine. || The chances of someone who looks like Jesus having pot raises steadily, to a point. If the guy is on a cross you may have the wrong guy. || Villains fear me because I am unpredictable and broccoli. See what I mean? || How to be a bouncer: be an asshole; stand near a door. || Hot Potato is a very different game when the people playing are starving. || Per capita - just about everyone has no idea what a ‘capita’ is. || One of my friends has a stutter and a lot of people think that's a bad thing, but to me that's just like starting certain words with a drum roll. That's not an impediment, that's suspense! What's he going to say? Car?... or Carnival?... Carburetor? Man... || Words have power, you dumb piece of shit. || The bird, the bee, the running child are all the same to the sliding glass door. || Now I got a time machine at home. It only goes foreword at regular speed.

He's a touche bag. || This is a fun game: If you have a planner, like, an old planner… just like, in a park, just leave the planner out on the ground. And then someone comes and picks it up, you know, and they open it, and inside, it just says: 1. Drop planner; 2. Wait for person to pick up planner; 3. Get person; 4. If they look around, wait ‘til tonight to get them. Or exactly one year from today. || To have the enthusiasm of a game show contestant and the dignity to never be one. || If I could control the behavior of fat guys I would make them ride mopeds more often. || When a couch potato is sliced up and then deep fried that is couch french fries. || The digital camera is a great invention because it allows us to reminisce. Instantly. || A lot of people don't like bumper stickers. I don't mind bumper stickers. To me a bumper sticker is a shortcut.

I like to get there really early before everyone else shows up and take like thirty bottles with notes in them and throw them into the water. Then I wait for everyone to come to the beach and when someone goes to pick up one of the bottles, I go up behind them because when they open it there’s a note saying ‘I’m standing right behind you.’ || Some of them relate to farts but they are not fart jokes. They would just be a fart in the joke but it’s about something else… || I am a mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a pita. Why the pita? That counts as another mystery. || I like people watching… Mostly this one woman. || ""Sort of"" is such a harmless thing to say... sort of. It's just a filler.

I fell down the stairs for an hour and a half. || So I was eating this cereal, and I had all these questions and comments. Luckily there was a number on the box. So I called, and said, ‘I have a question: Is this cereal as delicious as I think it is?' And I have a comment: 'yes'. || Sometimes if a woman has a really nice butt she'll wear tight pants. And then everyone looks at her butt when she walks by. That's nice, but it seems like a waste. Everybody's looking there, I feel like we should put important information on the butt. We should put the photos of missing children right on there. || If I ever saw bat shit, I’d be like, ‘that’s crazy.’ That's some crazy excrement right there. That looks like my ex-girlfriend's personality. || I feel stupid when I write the word banana. Its like, how many na's are on this thing? 'Cause I'm like ""Bana... keep going.

Need help? You should use more forceful language, you'll get more money.' || There's a store in my neighborhood called Futon World. I like that name, 'Futon World.' Makes me think of a magical place that gets less and less comfortable over time. || I wanna put stickers on turtles... I don’t know why. || I wanna buy a bunch of hermit crabs and make them live together. || Love is, and I hope it never isn’t. || You can say ‘Thanks,’ and you can say ‘Thanks a Million’ - but any number in between?.. || I like staying in hotels because you can leave a message for somebody and you don't even need to know their name, just, like, a room number. 'Hey, can I get a pen? I just want to leave a message. My friend's in 710. Yeah, thanks.' 'Leprechaun's gonna fuck you up at midnight.' 'Honey, what is this? Did you anger a small Irish man?' || It's go time! And by ""go"" I mean ""go sit down"". || One thing I learned is that it's never OK to walk through a cemetery dressed as a mummy - even if that was a shortcut on the way to the costume party. || If I were blind, I’d wear a blindfold all the time. || Man versus woman equals fun. Man versus man equals gay. Woman versus woman equals awesome. Man versus pillow equals crazy. Pillow versus pillow equals crazy awesome - that's a real pillow fight right there. You see two pillows fighting, you know something's going down. They're designed for relaxation. If they're fighting, what hope do we have? One time I saw two geese fighting, and I was like, 'This is a pillow fight ahead of time.'"
Denis Leary,"Another thing when I'm president? If you're in the army, the navy, any branch of the armed forces... you can fuck whoever you want! || I tried eating vegetarian. I felt like a wimp going into a restaurant. ""What do you want to eat sir? Broccoli?"" Broccoli's a side dish, folks. Always was, always will be, OK! When they ask me what I want, I say: What do you think I want? This is America. I want a bowl of raw red meat right now. || I don't do illegal drugs anymore. Now I just do the legal drugs. Tonight I'm on NyQuil and Sudafed. Let me tell you something, folks. Forget about cocaine and heroin. All you need is NyQuil and Sudafed. I'm telling you right now, I took NyQuil five years ago. I just came out of the coma tonight before the fucking show! || Don't buy the toys that make the noise! || Oh yeah jerking off is like an aerobic thing for me now man, I'm 40, I do it everyday, I do it everyday. Hell, I've even gone beyond porno, I'm back to regular network TV. || When I was a kid, Dunkin' Donuts had two things: coffee and donuts, and that was it! You took the donut, dunked it in the coffee, thus the fucking title of the place! || Remember that friend in High School, who wanted to make bongs out of everything? Making bongs out of apples and oranges and shit. One day you find your friend goin' ""Hey look, man, I made a bong out of my head! Put the pot in this ear and suck it out of this one, go on take a hit!"" || Personally, I think Jim Henson said it best when he said ""Anybody got an aspiren? I think I've got a cold."" || I eat meat because meat tastes like murder, and murder tastes pretty dam good! || Racism isn't born, folks, it's taught. I have a two-year-old son. You know what he hates? Naps! End of list. || What's the problem with just smoking a joint, eating a couple of twinkies, and going to sleep, was that a problem? || When I become president, all you assholes that ride bikes in the city? Lock and load! You're going down! || Sin is in, and so we begin... || Yeah, I'd like to do some cocaine. I'd like to do a drug that makes my penis small, makes my nose bleed, makes my heart explode, and sucks all my money out of the bank. || That's why I'm glad Jesus died when he did. Because if he lived to be 40, he would have ended up like Elvis. He was famous already at that point. If he lived to be 40, he'd be walking around Jerusalem with a big fat beer gut and black side burns going, Damn, I'm the son of God. Give me a cheeseburger and French fries right now. || I do have to say that I think that President Obama is the greatest President in the history of all of our Presidents, and that he can do no wrong in my book. So how's that for prejudice on the Democratic side? || Most movies suck, even the independent ones. Hollywood is like baseball: Hit three good ones out of 10 and you're a Hall of Famer. || Jerry Lewis has been married twenty times. He gets married on a Tuesday, they find his wife dead in a swimming pool on Thursday. Maybe if you married someone who's old enough to swim next time, Ok Jerry? || Coffee doesn't need a menu, it needs a cup! That's all it needs! Maybe a saucer underneath the cup - that's it! || Every time you hear about some famous guy overdosing on drugs, it's always some really talented guy. It's always like Len Bias, or Janis Joplin, or Jimi Hendrix, or John Belushi. You know what I mean? The people you wanna have overdose on drugs never would! Like Motley Crue would never fucking overdose man, never! || I would never do crack... I would never do a drug named after a part of my own ass, okay? || The best pitch I ever heard about cocaine was back in the early eighties when a street dealer followed me down the sidewalk going: I got some great blow man. I got the stuff that killed Belushi. || All men hear is blah, blah, blah, blah, SEX, blah, blah, blah, FOOD, blah, blah, blah, BEER. || Tommy has quit drinking and she shows up and all hell breaks loose. || Marriage is like a dull meal with the dessert at the beginning. || Do we need a two-and-a-half hour movie about the Doors? No, we don't. I can sum it up for you in five seconds, OK. I'm drunk. I'm nobody. I'm drunk. I'm famous. I'm drunk. I'm fucking dead. There's the whole movie, OK? || ""I'm just not happy, I'm just not happy. I'm just not happy because my life didn't turn out the way I thought it would."" Hey, join the fucking club! I thought I was going to be the starting center fielder for the Boston Red Sox. Life sucks, get a fucking helmet! Alright? || NyQuil, NyQuil, NyQuil! We love you, you giant fucking ""Q""! || Thou shalt not? Fuck that, thou fucking shall! || Most people think life sucks, and then you die. Not me. I beg to differ. I think life sucks, then you get cancer, then your dog dies, your wife leaves you, the cancer goes into remission, you get a new dog, you get remarried, you owe ten million dollars in medical bills but you work hard for thirty-five years and you pay it back and then - one day - you have a massive stroke, your whole right side is paralysed, you have to limp along the streets and speak out of the left side of your mouth and drool but you go into rehabilitation and regain the power to walk and the power to talk and then - one day - you step off a curb at Sixty-seventh Street, and BANG you get hit by a city bus and then you die. Maybe. || There we were in the middle of a sexual revolution wearing clothes that guaranteed we wouldn't get laid. || Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife? Bullshit! You covet his wife, his house, his car, and his pool. You know why? Because he's coveting every inch of your shit, pal! || My biggest regret in life is that I didn't hit John Denver in the mouth while I has the chance. || You all have that friend who's quitting it. I quit smoking. I quit drinking. I quit meat, and I feel great. I get up in at six in the morning and have a nice big bowl of oat bran. Then I go to the bathroom for three and a half hours. I eat another bowl of oat bran and go back into the bathroom for six more hours. All I do is eat and shit, I'm gonna live forever! My colon's the strongest muscle in my body right now. I could pass Elvis through my colon! || I love to smoke. I smoke seven thousand packs a day! || Crazy? ... Maybe. But that's a good kind of crazy. It's a guy who knows what he wants. || I bought my daughter a Chihuahua and I fell in love with it. So now I carry Coco around with me all the time. || I can remember a time in this country when men were proud to get cancer, goddammit! It was a sign of manhood! John Wayne had cancer twice. Second time, they took out one of his lungs. He said, ""Take 'em both! I don't fucking need 'em! I'll grow gills and breathe like a fish!"" || And you can't smoke in any of this coffee places. Can't smoke at Starbucks, can't smoke in dunkin' doughnuts... I'm pretty sure coffee was invented by people who were smoking anyways. And they just wanted to invent something so they can stay up late and smoke fucking more! That's my theory. Just ask me or Columbo, he'll back me up on this one. || I'm in my truck talking to Jesus. And you can see a World Series ring on my right pinkie finger. But when I take my sunglasses off a second later, it's gone. It's the whole divine intervention thing. You know Jesus had something to do with them winning. || I'm gonna get one of those tracheotomies, so I can smoke two cigarettes at the same time! I'm gonna get nine tracheotomies, all around my neck, I'll be Tracheotomy Man! He can smoke a pack at a time, he's Tracheotomy Man! || You're 16 years old, you don't know shit about shit, and pull up your pants! || I'm the enemy because I like to think. I like to read. I'm into freedom of speech and freedom of choice. I'm the kind of guy that could sit in a greasy spoon and wonder, gee, should I have the T-bone steak or the jumbo rack of barbecue ribs or the side order of gravy fries? I want high cholesterol. I would eat bacon and butter and buckets of cheese. Okay? I want to smoke Cuban cigars the size of Cincinnati in the nonsmoking section. I want to run through the streets naked with green Jell-O all over my body reading Playboy magazine. Why? Because I might suddenly feel the need to. Okay, pal? || Ted Kennedy, a good senator but a bad date you know what I mean? ""What'd I forget? Goddamit the fuckin' girl! Jesus Christ where are my pants?"" || Did you ever notice they never take any fat hostages? You never see a guy coming out of Lebanon going: I was held hostage for seven months and I lost 175 pounds, I feel good and I look good and I learned self-discipline. That's the important thing. || I'm the Lord of the Dance! Fuck Michael Flatley, it's me! || Smoking takes ten years off your life. Well it's the ten worst years, isn't it folks? It's the ones at the end! It's the wheelchair, kidney dialysis, adult diaper fucking years. You can have those years! We don't want 'em, alright? || Remember Jim Fixx? The big famous jogging guy? Jogged fifteen miles a day. Did a jogging book. Did a jogging video. Dropped dead of a heart attack when? When he was fucking jogging, that's when! || I know I'll never have a weight problem, you know why? First morning I wake up and can't see my dick? I stop eating! || I take music pretty seriously. You see that scar on my wrist? You see that? You know where that's from? I heard the Bee Gees were getting back together again. I couldn't take it, OK! || It doesn't matter how big the warnings on the cigarettes are; you could have a black pack, with a skull and crossbones on the front, called tumors, and smokers would be around the block going, ""I can't wait to get my hands on these fucking things! I bet ya get a tumor as soon as you light up!"" || I'm high as a kite and my teeth are green, Merry fucking Christmas! || Loud, stupid and overeating will suffice as long as we also have the funny, the fierce and the intellectual. || Jon Stewart is exactly the same guy he's always been, only with money. He knows that the moment he really believes he's important, the funny goes away and he becomes Bill O'Reilly, except shorter and Jewish. || I'm really good at laundry, and I have no problem cleaning the kitchen. || I've eaten things that didn't complain this much. || I want you to take away the hope because that's the thing that's killing me. || My parents used to beat the living shit out of me, okay? And I'm glad they did, and I'm looking forward to beating the shit out of my kids! || Heavy Metal fans are buying Heavy Metal records, taking the records home, listening to the records and then blowing their heads off with shotguns? Where's the problem? That's an unemployment solution right there, folks! It's called natural selection. || We live in a country where John Lennon takes eight bullets, Yoko Ono is walking right beside him and not one hits her. Explain that to me! || You know why the French hate us so much? Thay gave us the croissant. And you know what we did with it? We turned it into our croissandwich, thank you very much. || Sorry folks, I'm a little hyped up, I was smoking a big, fat bag of crack right before the show, ahhh!  || I've good kids, I love my kids. I try to bring them up the right way, not spanking them. I find that I don't have to spank them. I find that waving the gun around pretty much gets the same job done! || The biggest battle for a lot of people who come out of the theater, which is where I was trained, is that they can never forget that a camera is pointed at them. || The things that make me angry still make me angry. George Carlin is 67, and he's still as funny as he's ever been, and he's still angry. And that makes me feel good, because I feel like if I stick around long enough, I'll still be able to work. || With any actor, if you know your character well enough, you'll know pretty much what he would say under any circumstance, or whatever situation might rear its head. || You can have good writing, but a great actor will make it feel and sound like great writing. You can have great writing, and mediocre actors will make it feel mediocre. Without the actors, you have nothing. || You can't teach somebody how to be funny. You're either funny, or you ain't. || Every job has parts of it that are a giant pain in the ass - whether you carry a penis or a purse. || White men have screwed this country up! I would like a black, female…. everything all rolled into one.I want something different. I want a real change. People, I want a president who speaks well, who has a sense of humor. This guy is such a moron! It's beyond the point where it's a joke. He's an idiot. || I just think it's difficult for them to see the forest for the trees right now, which I can't blame them for, given the circumstances they found themselves in. || It's always great to get word that you've been picked up for another season, ... We're really hitting our stride and have great story lines already mapped out for next year. || I will tell you that the last five shows are going to really blow people out of the water. There's gonna be a lot of head-spinning going on. || We didn't have rehab back in the Seventies. Back in the Seventies, rehab meant you stopped doing coke, but you kept smoking pot and drinking for a couple more weeks. || I actually like talking. || I'm sick and tired of our generation being called the TV generation. What do you expect? We watched Lee Harvey Oswald get his brains blown out all over. How could we change the channel after that? || Science fiction was never my thing. I have no interest in it. || ...and there ain't a goddamn thing anybody can do about it, you know why? Because we've got the bombs! That's why, yeah! Two words: nuclear fuckin' weapons! Ok?! || No woman can be completely happy at any one moment in time. They're always anticipating the next thing to argue or complain about. || We live in a country where Rosa Parks had the courage and conviction to sit down long enough to start a revolution that lead to Al Sharpton screaming racism every time Barry Bonds gets indicted for taking performance enhancing drugs in order to break a home run record set by a black man who didn't even have the benefit of Advil. || Not eating meat is a decision, eating meat is an instinct. || Kathy Bates is sexy. It's partly because of her talent, but she's got a great face, and a great laugh. || God... crack. Only in America would a guy invent crack. Only in America would there be a guy that cocaine wasn't good enough for. You know? One guy walking around New York City back in 1985 going, ""You know, that cocaine's pretty good, but I want something that makes my heart explode as soon as I smoke it, ok? I want to take one suck off that crack pipe and go (snort) Now I'm happy! I'm dead, the ultimate high!"" || The people you would have overdose on drugs never would. Like Motley Crue would never fucking overdose, man, never. You could put them in a room with two tons of crack, they'd come out half an hour later, going ""Rock on man!"" || I'm gonna get famous. Then when my career starts to flag, I'm gonna go into a three month fucking bender, OK? Coke, and fucking pot, and smack, and fucking booze, and drive over people, and beat up my kids, go into therapy, go into rehab, come outta rehab, be on the cover of People magazine, and go Sorry! I fucked up! || I will not bond. I will not share. I refuse to nurture. || I think we should take Iraq and Iran and combine them into one country and call it Irate. All the pissed off people live in one place and get it over with. || As long as you don't have sex with kids or kill anybody you can do whatever the fuck you want in my church! || Yeah, I love living in New York, man, and people who live in New York, we wear that fact like a badge right on our sleeve because we know that fact impresses everybody! I was in Vietnam. So what? I live in New York! || This is the most exciting place in the world to live. Oh yeah! There are so many ways to die in New York City! Race riots, drive by shootings, subway crashes, construction cranes collapsing on the sidewalks, manhole covers blowing up and asbestos shooting into the sky. || I'm gonna open up my own place. Open my own restaurant and get away from you people. I'm gonna open up a restaurant with two smoking sections; Ultra and Regular, OK! And we're not gonna have any tables or any chairs or any napkins. None of that pussy shit. || Happiness comes in small doses folks. It's a cigarette butt, or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm. You come, you smoke the butt you eat the cookie you go to sleep wake up and go back to fucking work the next morning, that's it! End of fucking list! || Why hate someone for the colour of their skin when there are much better reasons to hate them. || Behind the counter, another eighteen-year-old kid. Both ears-pierced. Both nostrils-pierced. Both eyebrows fucking pierced! And his tongue is hanging out, you know why his tongue is hanging... cuz he has a six-inch steel stud imbedded in the middle of it! That's just one more thing for your dad to grab a hold of when he's pissed off at you."
Dennis Miller,"Now let me get this straight. Bush is anti-abortion, but pro-death penalty. I guess it's all in the timing, huh? || Sure, the lion is king of the jungle but airdrop him into Antarctica, and he's just a penguin's bitch. || The Left believes in cradle to the grave assistance, it’s just sometimes really tricky making it to the cradle. || The world is so ass-backwards it almost makes you wish you were dyslexic. || I think we have to help the helpless. The clueless? I don't give a rat's ass about the clueless. || The easiest job in the world has to be coroner. Surgery on dead people. What's the worst thing that could happen? If everything went wrong, maybe you'd get a pulse. || If some unemployed punk in New Jersey, can get a cassette to make love to Elle McPherson for $19.95, this virtual reality stuff is going to make crack look like Sanka. || The biggest conspiracy has always been the fact that there is no conspiracy. Nobody's out to get you. Nobody gives a shit whether you live or die. There, you feel better now? || There is a chalk outline being drawn around common sense, and most people cannot even identify the victim. || I've always loved the flirtatious tango of consonants and vowels, the sturdy dependability of nouns and capricious whimsy of verbs, the strutting pageantry of the adjective and the flitting evanescence of the adverb, all kept safe and orderly by those reliable little policemen, punctuation marks. Wow! Think I got my ass kicked in high school? || The death penalty is becoming a way of life in this country. || Listen, the weather is just like Hillary's explanation for her war vote: we just don't know, do we? || The current tax code is harder to understand than Bob Dylan reading Finnegans Wake in a wind tunnel. || Americans stick their nose where it doesn't belong more than Cyrano de Bergerac giving head. || I'm actually equal parts cynicism and apathy. I'm always willing to believe the worst as long as it doesn't take too much effort. || The good thing about Pittsburgh, it's a good place to be raised... it doesn't tolerate assholes. You're either a good guy or you're a bad guy... When I'm in Los Angeles having these incredibly surreal moments where nobody's saying anything and everybody's talking incessantly, I always have that Pittsburgh voice in my head - shut up, smile, get the job, move on. || Human beings are human beings. They say what they want, don't they? They used to say it across the fence while they were hanging wash. Now they just say it on the Internet. || German reunification: I view this in much the same way I view a possible Dean Martin - Jerry Lewis reconciliation: I never really enjoyed their work, and I'm not sure I need to see any of their new stuff. || I haven't seen someone so overmatched since Mike Tyson tried to recite the alphabet. || A good rule of thumb is if you've made it to thirty-five and your job still requires you to wear a name tag, you've made a serious vocational error. || I was wondering if Circuit City could possibly make their receipts just a little bit longer. || For the foreseeable future, we're going to need oil products because I don't like the idea of hydrogen cars. I'm not sure I want to be cruising around a mall parking lot filled with a thousand mini-Hindenburgs. || I didn't know my Dad - he moved out early. And my mom's politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn't think about Democrats or Republicans. She thought about who made sense. I've been both in my life. || What's so touching is the way we fight the war right until the moment our business is taken care of and then we turn on a dime and we immediately start taking care of people. It's like a shock and aw shucks campaign. || And by the way, my belief is that if men were the ones getting pregnant, abortions would be easier to get than food poisoning in Moscow. || It's your living room, it's your life, go nuts. You like Home Improvement? Tape it and go over it like it's the Zapruder film. || When I went to college, I lived on campus, and the guys I hung out with made the characters in Revenge of the Nerds look like the Rat Pack in 1962. I, myself made that kid Booger look like Remington Steele. || That field goal attempt was so far to the left it nearly decapitated Lyndon LaRouche. || One man's Voltaire is another man's Screech. || There's no doubt about it, show business lures the people who didn't get enough love, attention, or approval early in life and have grown up to become bottomless, gaping vessels of terrifying, abject need. Please laugh. || What's so touching is the way we fight the war right until the moment our business is taken care of and then we turn on a dime and we immediately start taking care of people. It's like a shock and aw shucks campaign. || The average American's day planner has fewer holes in it than Ray Charles's dart board. || I'm one of the more pessimistic cats on the planet. I make Van Gogh look like a rodeo clown. || Here in Hollywood you can actually get a marriage license printed on an Etch-A-Sketch. || Elected office holds more perks than Elvis' nightstand. || If Clinton had only attacked terrorism as much as he attacks George Bush we wouldn't be in this problem. || The White House looked into a plan that would allow illegal immigrants to stay in the United States. The plan called for a million Mexicans to marry a million of our ugliest citizens. || Why is electricity so expensive these days? Why does it cost so much for something I can make with a balloon and my hair? || ""What would Jesus drive?"" I don't know about you, but I always picture my God having a driver. Well, Jesus would naturally have an SUV, cause He always had those twelve idiots hanging around, making Him change shit into food every four and a half minutes. ""See the cigarette? It's a fish. Leave me alone."" || Any female teachers watching the show tonight, you've got to quit dating the students. That's the least we expect out of you. When I was 14 years old, my teacher wouldn't let me bang the erasers. || He admitted this was stupid. It's a very serious offence. I wouldn't consider it a prank. ... It could have turned into something that caused far more injury, and even death, than it did. || Since the bus, a lot of people go to Florida who wouldn't if they had to hire a driver. || Now I don't have anything against Mexican people, but for God's sakes, sign the gust book on the way in. || I don't know what I think of George W. Bush when he first got in, but I've grown fond of the man, and maybe it's the times we live in. They say he's not an environmentalist. But every time I see his ranch on TV, it looks pretty nice. You know something, if we all took care of our own, we'd have a great environment. || The man who accused Richard Simmons of slapping him in an airport has dropped the assault charge. Dropped it! Upon hearing the news, Simmons sadly responded, ""You mean I'm not going to prison?"" || One man's Voltaire is another man's Screech. || Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but guilt is simply God's way of letting you know that you're having too good a time. || Joan Rivers telling Lauren Bacall her dress is all wrong is like Carrot Top telling Lenny Bruce he needs to get an edge. || Washington, DC is to lying what Wisconsin is to cheese. || Never ever discount the idea of marriage. Sure, someone might tell you that marriage is just a piece of paper. Well, so is money, and what's more life-affirming than cold, hard cash? || Just put down 9/11... I think, on most things I'm liberal, except on defending ourselves and keeping half the money. Those things I'm kind of conservative on. || I'm like Bush, I see the world more like checkers than chess. || NASA! There's a crack unit, huh? These guys make Amtrak look like a team of micro surgeons. The Soviets are building Chuck E Cheeses' on Mars, we break out the party hats if we get down to three in the countdown. || If somebody wants to shoot up and die in front of you, more power to them. The herd has a way of thinning itself out. || Thanks to the notion of dysfunction, every zipperhead in this country can tap himself with a Freudian wand and go from failed frog to misunderstood prince. || Only man is a narcissistic enough species to think that a highly evolved alien life force would travel across billions and billions of light-years- a group of aliens so intelligent, so insouciant, so utterly above it all, they feel no need whatsoever to equip their spacecraft with windows so that they can gaze out on all that celestial beauty-but then immediately upon landing, their first impulse is to get in some hick's ass with a flashlight. || Listen, I would call the French scum bags, but that, of course, would be a disservice to bags filled with scum. I say we invade Iraq, then invade Chirac. || What is guilt? Guilt is the pledge drive constantly hammering in our heads that keeps us from fully enjoying the show. Guilt is the reason they put the articles in Playboy. || Born again?! No, I'm not. Excuse me for getting it right the first time. || What's so touching is the way we fight the war right until the moment our business is taken care of and then we turn on a dime and we immediately start taking care of people. It's like a shock and aw shucks campaign. || I don't have credibility, I'm a comedian. || Technology is fine, but that popular vision of the future, where you plug somebody in and leave them there and they don't get out and interact with actual flesh-and-blood humans - you know the answer before I say it - that's not good. || I'm a comedian, for God's sake. Viewers shouldn't trust me. And you know what? They're hip enough to know they shouldn't trust me. I'm just doing stand-up comedy. || There's nothing wrong with being shallow as long as you're insightful about it. || Parenting is the most important job on the planet next to keeping Gary Busey off the nation's highways. || A recent police study found that you're much more likely to get shot by a fat cop if you run. || We should fight to preserve a country where people such as Michael Moore get to miss the point as badly as he misses it. Michael Moore represents everything I detest in a human being. || If you want somebody to repair your roads, educate your kids, or purify your water supply, you may want to turn to private enterprise, but if you want massive fuckloads of your enemies wiped out in record time, Uncle Sam is the man for you. || The simple fact is, you've got to view this war like we've been on a long family car ride. Bush is the father and he's been screaming 'don't make me come back there!' for around 200 miles now and it just reached the point where we had to pull the car over and the bad kid is going to get the spanking of his life. || I'll say this about the war protesters: At least most of them are only putting duct tape across their mouths so I can still tell the rest of them to blow it out their ass. || This place makes Mayberry look like a think tank. || The government could take away all the drugs in the world and people would spin around on their lawns until they fell down and saw God. || Hell, the vows are scary enough. I mean, ""We are gathered here to witness the joining of two people..."" Joining. Could we come up with a slightly more industrial term, huh? How about ""soldering""? Yeah, have a couple of guys from the machinists' union swing by, drop the welder's masks, and handle this part of the ceremony? You know, it seems like the only two times they pronounce you anything in life is when they pronounce you ""man and wife"" or ""dead on arrival."" || It's ironic that in our culture everyone's biggest complaint is about not having enough time; yet nothing terrifies us more than the thought of eternity. || I rant, therefore I am. || We need anything politically important rationed out like Pez: small, sweet, and coming out of a funny, plastic head. || A lot of people voting for Pat Buchanan say they are doing so to send a message. Apparently that message is, ""Hey, look at me, I'm an idiot."" || Was watching CNN one night, the first Gulf War, they are sitting around in the Baghdad hotel, the No Roof Inn or something, and they're watching ""the Bachelor,"" and it's a little harder for the bachelor over there because it's tough to tell who's hot under the Burqua. They had just ordered some hummuus and smores from room service and all of a sudden a gallaga game broke out. || Teresa Lewis, the only woman on death row in Virginia, says she doesn't deserve the death penalty because she only hired the killers of her husband and stepson, she didn't actually pull the trigger herself. You know, she has a point. I think we should let her be able to hire the person who executes her, and not do yourself in! How's that, doll? Yeah! Get it over with quick, maybe Charlize Theron will sign up to play you. || I’m left on a lot of things. If two gay guys want to get married, I could care less. If a nut case from overseas wants to blow up their wedding, that’s when I’m right. || When it comes down to it, we're really just a big ant farm with beepers. || Parenting is the easiest job to get - you just have to screw up once and it's yours. || I believe everything I say in the show, but I don't walk around in my everyday life like some incensed Rasputin. If I did, do you know how alone I'd be in the world? || They say life begins at 50. Yeah, if you're the fuckin' Highlander. || Amtrak announced this week that they plan to install cable TV into their sleeper births. Great. So now you can watch your derailment live on CNN. || I saw hamlet at the Globe Theater. Notice I didn't say I heard it. Some asshole with a whooping cough was right behind me.

I think it will be difficult to get people to pay for something on the Internet that they can find elsewhere on the Internet for free. || I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to usher the program through its early stages of growth. For 10 years I have approached my responsibilities with pride and with passion. It has been a tremendous experience to work with our amazing student-athletes. || Trends don't mean anything to me. If I like something, I'll do it. If I don't, I won't do it, and I wouldn't care if everybody in the country mocked me. || I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman where the Self Help section was. She said if she told me it would defeat the purpose. || A developer is someone who wants to build a house in the woods. An environmentalist is someone who already has a house in the woods. || Santa is very jolly because he knows where all the bad girls live. || Then people ask me if I'm worried about the effects of global warming on my kids. Well, obviously I love my kids and I want them to live to be a 100. So that's another 1.8 degrees. My kids’ kids? Three point six. I'll just tell them we moved to Phoenix. || You know, folks, the French have always been reluctant to surrender to the wishes of their friends, and almost anticipatory in their urge to surrender to the wishes of their enemies. || It's a shame about the fish, it's a shame about the lake. But it'd be worse if it burst and people died. || There should be some kind of dedication of a portion of the funds to Town Center. || The claim that somehow raw foods give you better energy, are more healthful, improve your immune system and all of that is simply not substantiated. And moreover, it's not biologically plausible. || We are simultaneously the most hated, loved, feared and admired nation on this planet. In short, we are Frank Sinatra. And the Chairman didn't make his bones laying down for punks... || The Soviet Union, which has complained recently about alleged anti-Soviet themes in American advertising, lodged an official protest this week against the Ford Motor Company's new campaign: 'Hey you stinking fat Russian, get off my Ford Escort.' || A recent conversation: Dubya: Look at the clock, time is racing! Cheney: That's the second hand, George. || I still feel pangs of remorse over an insidious habit I've had since I was a teenager. About three times a week, I attend estate auctions and make insulting, low-ball bids for prized heirlooms until I'm asked to leave. || After seven years of marriage, I'm sure of two things - first, never wallpaper together, and second, you'll need two bathrooms... both for her. The rest is a mystery, but a mystery I love to be involved in. || You've got bad eating habits if you use a grocery cart in 7-Eleven. || We should fight to preserve a country where people such as Michael Moore get to miss the point as badly as he misses it. Michael Moore represents everything I detest in a human being. || Two wrongs may not make a right, but a thousand wrongs make a writer. || The only way the French are going in is if we tell them we found truffles in Iraq. || Somebody can say they don't understand why somebody drifts. But I've always found people who drift interesting, 'cause it shows me the game's not stagnant in their own head. They're thinking. || Most Americans will let liberals and conservatives play their games because most Americans don't pay attention. || America may be the best country in the world, but that's kind of like being the valedictorian of summer school. || A new poll shows that Senator Kerry's support in the South is strongest amongst blacks. Kerry's appeal to Southern blacks is obvious. He is a white man who lives far, far away. || Do you think that during the Dust Bowl in the 1930's in the Midwest people thought ""Wow, this must be global warming"" or did they just think ""Fuck, it hasn't rained in a while."" || Is global warming new? I don't know. When I was young I remember the sun being hot. || I come from that earlier time in America when palm pilot was a nickname you recieved upon entering puberty! I was more than a palm pilot I was the palm Chuck Jager. Tom Wolfe wrote a book about me called ""The Right Hand Stuff"". I was the only guy in my class hip enough to move to the European grip. || To me, nature always appears more unbalanced than Gary Busey with a clogged Eustachian tube. || And I've always been paranoid. I can remember as a baby my mother would spin the mobile above my head and thinking...""yeah, that's coming down."" || I used to be sceptic, but not anymore, because now I am positive that I'm getting screwed. || You have to just marvel at the stun-gun absurdity of fighting to the death over what happens after you die. || South African schoolchildren set a world record this week by creating the world's longest clothesline. Hey, what do South Africans wash their clothes with? Apar-Tide! || I'm sorry, those pictures from the Abu Ghraib. At first, they, like infuriated me, I was sad. Then like, a couple days later, after they cut the guy's head off, they didn't seem like much. And now, I like to trade them with my friends. || I think the American legal system sucks worse than a Celine Dion cover version of ""Whole Lotta Love."" || At one time, Washington actually meant something.

It confuses the children! || Everyone wants answers and wants to know what the timeline is. Unfortunately, it's a complex situation, and we don't have the final answers yet. || And quit bringing up our forefathers and saying they were civil libertarians. Our founding fathers would have never tolerated any of this crap. For God's sake, they were blowing peoples' heads off because they put a tax on their breakfast beverage. And it wasn't even coffee. || We're not allowed to do anything to nature anymore, except look at it. It's like porn with leaves. || Economists predict that this year's federal surplus will be $120 billion less than predicted in January. The missing $120 billion was reportedly last seen on a date with Congressman Gary Condit. || The American education system couldn't be more badly directed or poorly funded if the Secretary of Education were Ed Wood. || President Bush gave his first-ever presidential radio address in both English and Spanish. Reaction was mixed, however, as people were trying to figure out which one was which. || Police in Washington D.C. are now using cameras to catch drivers who go through red lights. Many congressmen this week opposed the use of the red light cameras incorrectly assuming they were being used for surveillance at local brothels. || Liberals should not overplay this weapons of mass destruction card, because you want me to tell you the truth? Most of us are not going to care if they don't find these weapons of mass destruction. It's enough for a lot of us to see those kids smiling on that street again. || I had fun pretending to be a sportscaster. People always think that was a down thing for me. I had the best job in sports broadcasting for two years. || And finally, and most importantly, the next time we go to war, don't give a specific reason for the war that the left can seize upon and later flog us with it ad nauseam, just do it. Remember, the first rule of Fight Club is that you don't talk about Fight Club. || Growing up, my family wasn't very tight. We were more like a tour group with secrets... || Jack Kerouac was cool because he had no idea he was. || You like the Red Skelton painting? Buy the Red Skelton painting. You like ""Home Improvement""? Tape it and go over it like the Zapruder film. It's your life; live it on your terms. || The soldiers kill suicide bombers. Think about that. When a guys whole thing in life is to kill himself and you get there first... you are halling ass my friends. || The radical right is so homophobic that they're blaming global warming on the AIDS quilt. || The stream-of-consciousness style is my monkey trick. I sit there, I watch stuff, and cultural references bump into my head. || Of course he needs to renegotiate his salary - the guy buys more snow than Seward did when he bought Alaska from the Russians."
Dick Gregory,"I went to Ethiopia, and it dawned on me that you can tell a starving, malnourished person because they've got a bloated belly and a bald head. And I realized that if you come through any American airport and see businessmen running through with bloated bellies and bald heads, that's malnutrition, too. || America will tolerate the taking of a human life without giving it a second thought. But don't misuse a household pet. || I wouldn't mind paying taxes - if I knew they were going to a friendly country. || Just being a Negro doesn't qualify you to understand the race situation any more than being sick makes you an expert on medicine. || There's a God force inside of you that gives you a will to live. || Riches do not delight us so much with their possession, as torment us with their loss. || Love is man's natural endowment, but he doesn't know how to use it. He refuses to recognize the power of love because of his love of power. || King was really telling us it's not about love, it's about being lovable. 'I love you baby and if I can't have you no one else will is frightening,' but once you become lovable we become safe and that's where I think we'll end up. || A Klaner (KKK) is a cat who gets out of bed in the middle of the night and takes his sheet with him. || I'm not a comic. I'm a humorist. || I used to get letters saying, 'I didn't know black children and white children were the same.' || Everything we do we should look at in terms of millions of people who can't afford it. || I never learned hate at home, or shame. I had to go to school for that. || A politician is a person skilled in the art of compromise. Usually an elected official who has compromised to get nominated, compromised to get elected, and compromised repeatedly to stay in office. || There is a limit on how much information you can keep bottled up. || For a black man, there's no difference between the North and the South. In the South, they don't mind how close I get, as long as I don't get too big. In the North, they don't mind how big I get, as long as I don't get too close. || People with high blood pressure, diabetes - those are conditions brought about by life style. If you change the life style, those conditions will leave. || When I lost my rifle, the Army charged me 85 dollars. That is why in the Navy the Captain goes down with the ship. || Coconut milk is the only thing on this planet that comes identically to mother's milk. || Civil Rights: What black folks are given in the U.S. on the installment plan, as in civil-rights bills. Not to be confused with human rights, which are the dignity, stature, humanity, respect, and freedom belonging to all people by right of their birth. || Baseball is very big with my people. It figures. It's the only way we can get to shake a bat at a white man without starting a riot. || If a man calls me a nigger, he is calling me something I am not. The nigger exists only in his own mind; therefore his mind is the nigger. I must feel sorry for such a man. || In America, with all of its evils and faults, you can still reach through the forest and see the sun. But we don't know yet whether that sun is rising or setting for our country. || Love is very dangerous if you just have love and don't have the ability to be lovable. || In most places in the country, voting is looked upon as a right and a duty, but in Chicago it's a sport. || Every holiday on the calendar, I check in a hotel and fast - I don't eat, I don't drink, I don't talk. || It was an unwritten law that black comics were not permitted to work white nightclubs. You could sing and you could dance, but you couldn't stand flat-footed and talk; that was a no-no. || Last time I was down South I walked into this restaurant, and this white waitress came up to me and said: 'We don't serve colored people here.' I said: 'that's all right, I don't eat colored people. Bring me a whole fried chicken.' || My belief is, you know, certain things have to be explained that's never been explained. || You know why Madison Avenue advertising has never done well in Harlem? We're the only ones who know what it means to be Brand X. || And we love to dance, especially that new one called the Civil War Twist. The Northern part of you stands still while the Southern part tries to secede. || When you have a good mother and no father, God kind of sits in. It's not enough, but it helps. || We used to root for the Indians against the cavalry, because we didn't think it was fair in the history books that when the cavalry won it was a great victory, and when the Indians won it was a massacre. || Being white is a job in America. You take that away, you better get the soldiers out. || Poor is a state of mind you never grow out of, but being broke is just a temporary condition. || The universe is not rich enough to buy the vote of an honest man. || People keep telling me about the white race and the black race - and it really doesn't make sense. I played Miami, met a fellow two shades darker than me - and his name was Ginsberg! Took my place in two sit-in demonstrations - nobody knew the difference. The he tried for a third lunch counter and blew the whole bit ... asked for blintzes. || A friend of mine who works for naval intelligence said an aerial satellite revealed that 1.9 million attended the event in 1995. But if they would have had a rumble at the march the newspapers would have said that 75 million Afro-Americans were there. || Nature is not affected by finance. If someone offered you ten thousand dollars to let them touch your eyeball without blinking, you would never collect the money. At the very last moment, Nature would force you to blink your eye. Nature will protect her own. || Race baiters and discriminators may go underground, but they never move out of town. || When I was a boy, I was taught never to use insulting expressions like, 'I've been gypped,' or, 'He welshed on the deal.' || To me, seeing a really great comedian is a bit like watching a musician or a poet. || When I first broke through, there was only NBC, CBS and ABC, and they had news in the morning and in the evening - there wasn't no 24-hour news. || Some kind of way, we have to say enough is enough. || We do not believe, had he been white, that he would be dead. And when we black folks say to America that we're not going to tolerate it, it's going to stop. || If you take 12 waters from the coconut - not the ones you buy in the store, although that's good - but the fresh coconuts, the little brown ones with the three eyes, if you take 12 of those within 24 hours, your blood will go back to the way it was when you were born. || If it wasn't for Abe Lincoln, I'd still be on the open market. || Hell hath no fury like a liberal scorned. || I never thought I'd see the day that I would see white folks as frightened, or more so, than black folks was during the civil rights movement when we was in Mississippi. || Let me tell you, never before in the history of this planet has anybody made the progress that African-Americans have made in a 30-year period, in spite of many black folks and white folks lying to one another. || I never believed in Santa Claus because I knew no white dude would come into my neighborhood after dark. || Political promises are much like marriage vows. They are made at the beginning of the relationship between candidate and voter, but are quickly forgotten. || I buy about $1,500 worth of papers every month. Not that I trust them. I'm looking for the crack in the fabric. || I tell people, 'If you want to send a message to the White House, call my house.' || I waited at the counter of a white restaurant for eleven years. When they finally integrated, they didn't have what I wanted. || You hear entertainers all the time, saying, 'If I couldn't get paid for this, I'd do it for free.' When's the last time you ever heard a business person say, 'If I couldn't get paid for being chairman of British Petroleum, I'd do it for free'? || You know, I always say white is not a colour, white is an attitude, and if you haven't got trillions of dollars in the bank that you don't need, you can't be white. || The only good thing about the good old days is they're gone. || My mother was the sweetest lady who ever lived on this planet, but if you tried to tell her that Jesus wasn't a Christian, she would stomp you to death. || You're looking at something that is going to revolutionize the whole world. || We thought I was going to be a great athlete, and we were wrong, and I thought I was going to be a great entertainer, and that wasn't it either. I'm going to be an American Citizen. First class. || Once we used to have to crank up our cars, now you can pop it on from inside your house. Everything has changed except how we get freedom. || Once I realised the value of making people laugh, I got very good at it. Fast. || The NAACP is a wonderful organization. Belong to it myself. But do you realize if tomorrow morning we had complete integration, all them cats would be out of work? || Now here's what I'm saying: I've always believed that every other month we hear about compromisation of bank records, I think that's the CIA and the FBI. Now let me tell you why I'm saying this. I don't believe no insignificant pip-squeak is going to be able to pull this off month after month and we can't find out what's going on. || Dear Momma - Wherever you are, if ever you hear the word 'nigger' again, remember they are advertising my book. || No kid in the world, no woman in the world should ever raise a hand against a no-good daddy. That's already been taken care of: A Man Who Destroys His Own Home Shall Inherit the Wind. || It's cool to be healthy. || Black conservatives have a right to exist, but why would I want to walk around with a swastika on my shirt after the way Hitler done messed it up? || So why would I want to call myself a conservative after the way them white racist thugs have used that word to hide behind? They call themselves new Republicans. || One of the things I keep learning is that the secret of being happy is doing things for other people. || When I go through the airport and see white women walking through the airport barefooted, like athlete's feet don't exist, there's something wrong. || If they took all the drugs, nicotine, alcohol and caffeine off the market for six days, they'd have to bring out the tanks to control you. || I am really enjoying the new Martin Luther King Jr stamp - just think about all those white bigots, licking the backside of a black man."
Dom Irrera,"You can't have an honest fourth grade school teacher. ""Mr. and Mrs. Jones, Johnny, your son, your only child, the fruit of your loin, is a moron. I have no idea how this kid finds a door to get out of the house in the morning. If I were you, I would waste him and start over. Now, I say that with all due respect."" || I love that red wine is good for you. Isn't that cool? I want to hear more of this. I want to hear more things in life like, ""Red wine, in conjunction with a lap dance, while watching NFL football, is the best cardiovascular workout you can have."" || Nobody needs a cookie. You will never get your lab results back, ""Well, apparently, Miss Bexim what you need - and I am a doctor, I've never seen this before - some sort of a cookie. You're actually too healthy. You need a cookie."" || Oh, that's very profound, 'Insight Man'. || I was an actor in college and it was much easier than being a waiter. I thought it was fun to get paid. People were not exactly surprised to see me going in the field. || My father never cheated on my mother. He used to cheat on me. He used to pick other kids after school. Take them to the zoo. Take them to play ball. One day he came to me. He says, ""Look I got to level with you. I met another kid."" || My whole family, all they talk about is food and disease. And they're competitive with illness: ""I have a cold."" ""I wish I had a cold! I don't even have sinuses anymore."" || That's one thing nobody ever bitching about in a restaurant - parsley. You never see some indignant customer: ""Waiter, please! Can we get a little more parsley over here?"" || I want to be a bloated alcoholic. That's my goal - it is, I'm serious, because there is no other disease that is more fun than alcoholism. I know it has its downside, but I'll tell you, there's no other party disease like alcohol. || Well, I am not always joking, sometimes I am serious. But some people always expect you to be funny. If you were like you are on stage, you would be obnoxious. With the jokes and the putdowns, I would need to take a break... juggle something. || Everyone always says, ""Does it bother you that Italians are always portrayed as Mafia characters?"" No, it doesn't bother me. First of all, not everybody in my family is in the Mafia. I have one uncle who's clean. || You know those Italian eraser phrases? ""That guy is a lowlife scummy little fat rat weasel bastard… I don't mean that in a bad way."" Yeah, in the best possible way you can mean that. || We lost my grandmother recently. No, she didn't die - we lost her. She actually shrunk to the point we can't find her anymore. It's so sad 'cause we know she's still in the house, she's just not visible to the naked eye. || So he says My wife's a pain in the ass. She's always busting my friggin' agates. My daughter's married to a real loser bastard. And I got a rash so bad on my ass I can't even sit down. But you know me. I can't complain. || My cousin Louie, we walk into a bar, and he says, ""Dom, I think that waitress knows me."" ""What do you think she knows, Louie? The fact that your belly came in four steps ahead of you?"" || You ever get sick and one of your friends gives you medical advice? And they tell you that they're not a doctor - like you didn't know it?"
Don Rickles,"In our day we went from - we went into saloons. We couldn't cross over like you can today, get a television series and all of a sudden you're a major movie star, you know. || Eddie Fisher married to Elizabeth Taylor is like me trying to wash the Empire State Building with a bar of soap. || You lose your energy, you lose that excitement and it gets the audience up. || I told jokes badly. || I still have drive, but everything is relative. || Political correctness? In my humor, I never talk about politics. I was never much into all that. || Show business is my life. When I was a kid I sold insurance, but nobody laughed. || No matter where you go in this world, you will always find a Jew sitting in the beach chair next to you. || It takes many years to be a great comedian. || Whatever you do to gain success, you have to hang in there and hope good things happen. Always think positive. || Showbiz is great if you're successful. || I've never walked off stage and said, ""I shouldn't have done that."" Because when you do what I do, you're like a fighter. You throw the right hand and say, ""That's what got me to this dance."" You can't have doubt. If you have doubt, there's no show. || You can't study comedy; it's within you. It's a personality. My humor is an attitude. || You throw your best punch, otherwise don't do it. || I was sitting in the toilet and I was by myself. I was tired of playing with the roller, so I said I'd better write a book. || The transformation has been unbelievable. When I started here, I worked in a place where the Sky Room was on the second floor. || Sex is great, but when you get to be my age, you've got to pace it a little bit. Otherwise you get tired. || I don't have regrets. I've never sat here and thought, Gee, if only I'd done The Man Who Came to Dinner on Broadway, I would have been happier. || Famous people are deceptive. Deep down, they're just regular people. Like Larry King. We've been friends for forty years. He's one of the few guys I know who's really famous. One minute he's talking to the president on his cell phone, and then the next minute he's saying to me, Do you think we ought to give the waiter another dollar? || If I were to insult people and mean it, that wouldn't be funny. || You know what's funny to me? Attitude. || I've got an accountant who's been with me forty years. If he makes a mistake, he dies. || Smartphones. Who cares? Smartphones. I only have dummy phones. || I think if I took therapy, the doctor would quit. He'd just pick up the couch and walk out of the room. || It's tough having the last name Rickles. Luckily, my kids handled it great. || When you enter a room, you have to kiss his ring. I don't mind, but he has it in his back pocket. || Asians are nice people, but they burn a lot of shirts. || I have to have energy because I have a lot of expenses. A couple of cars, couple of dogs and a big estate. || I have no idea what I'm going to say when I stand up to give a toast. But I do know that anything I say I find funny. || I have a problem, if the light goes on on TV and it blinks midnight, I don't know how to fix it. || Well, I call myself an actor. I always wanted to be one. || Once in a while, when I'm alone, I think about my age. I think, How many more years do I have on this earth? But I can't really conceive of dying. Somehow, in my head, I don't think I'll die. I know that everybody dies, of course. I just think that it'll never come to me. It's crazy, but there it is. || People think being in your seventies means sitting around in a chair with a blanket over your legs, drooling. || I can sit all day in a comfortable chair and watch ball games, but I don't need a blanket. || I don't care if the average guy on the street really knows what I'm like, as long as he knows I'm not really a mean, vicious guy. My friends and family know what I'm really like. That's what's important. || Room service is great if you want to pay $500 for a club sandwich. || They always use the word 'insult' with me, but I don't hurt anybody. I wouldn't be sitting here if I did. I make fun of everybody and exaggerate all our insecurities. || Struggling is hard because you never know what's at the end of the tunnel. || Everything I've ever done in my whole career, people might not know, I've never written anything down on paper. || Funny is funny. || I cannot tell a joke. But I can do a situation, that it becomes a joke. || I do situations and make fun of authority and life. || To me, the stand up part in my life is great. I know I can do that. When I get an acting chance, I'm really thrilled. || When I'm onstage, I'm acting. || To my knowledge, I was the first guy really to do what I do. And then later on different comedians started trying doing it. || I never went out looking for glory. || I was a mother's boy. || My whole act is off the top of my head. || I don't feel an obligation to give everyone a hard time, but when they're important people, it's fun. || Some people say funny things, but I say things funny. || I'd like to think my performance is today. I never try to - it's so, as you know, watching me, I have a beginning, middle and ending. But every night the show changes and I relate to an audience and I relate to the young people. || I was always the guy - out of insecurities, I was always making fun, even as a kid. || The thing I love about Vegas is that it's a melting pot. It's like working Ellis Island. || The old days were the old days. And they were great days. But now is now. || I used to play golf. I wanted to be a better player, but after a while I realized I'd always stink. And that's when I really started to enjoy the game. || I'm not a big one for jokes. I can't tell a joke, believe it or not. If you gave me a thousand bucks and said, 'Don, get up at a party and tell a joke', I'm the worst. || I have my own gym. When you do jokes and they sell, you get a gym. || I mean, in my - and I'm not trying to do spilled milk, but in those days it was a little - I think it was much tougher, because you got an image, and you were in a saloon. And it was tough to come out of a saloon and to get in films, and to maintain an image, you know. || I always rib people, but nobody ever gives me a hard time. I don't know why. Maybe they're afraid of what I might say. There's probably a lesson in that somewhere, but I don't know what it is. || Who picks your clothes - Stevie Wonder? || I'm very shy so I became very outgoing to protect my shyness. || When you stand alone and sell yourself, you can't please everyone. But when you're different, you can last."
Donald Glover,"Girls are supposed to dance. That's why God gave them parts that jiggle. || Never kiss in public, but at home I am affectionate. || What I wanna know is why I never fit in right like a fat dude getting on a packed flight. || Love it when you're smiling. || If you’re a girl, and dont give blowjobs, go ahead and curl up with your cats and your twilight dvd’s... because you are going to die alone. || Came on this beat, I ain’t even buy it dinner. || I got really lost last year. But I can’t be lonely though. Cause we’re all stuck here. I wanted to make something that says no matter how bad you fuck up, or mistakes you’ve made during the year, your life, your eternity. You’re always allowed to be better. You’re always allowed to grow up. If you want. || Are their Asian girls here?! Minority report! || We had a teacher, named Mr. Brown, and he was writing something on the board once - he was writing something on the board, and he farted. And you would have thought kids had seen the face of God. Kids weren't even laughing; they were just sitting there screaming, just screaming. Kids had to get carted out; kids were screaming. Kids had to get carted out, and they were going to the nurses' office. Kids are crying in the hallway. 'Oh, this is our 9/11.' And it was. It was their 9/11 'cause they never thought anything like that could ever happen. || I write raps so sometimes I will write them in my iPhone. So I was writing the n-word in my iPhone and my iPhone goes, 'Did you mean niggardly?' And I was like, 'No iPhone. I meant nigger; write it.' But then, two weeks later, I was writing Jigga - which is the shortened form of Jay-Z. And my iPhone goes, 'Did you mean nigger?' And I went, 'Whoa, iPhone. You do not get to say that.' || I'm probably going to get in trouble for this but 'American Dad' is one of my favourite shows. It gets very dark in places but the jokes are there. || I started doing '30 Rock' and started writing 'Mystery Team' at the beginning of that. While I was doing 'Mystery Team,' I started practicing stand-up. While I was doing stand up, I got 'Community.' It's like I planted trees six years ago, and now they have fruit. || I'm very impatient, so I was like, 'I want to be able to do whatever I want now.' But even the biggest stars - you look back and they weren't overnight. || I think it started when she said she's happier without me. I can't really blame her 'cause I'm happier without me! || I come around when you least expect me! I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty! || I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference, but you'll probably know it's you after the first sentence. || I'm always fucking childish, you knew that when you met me! || The worst is feeling worthless. || You started rapping when you wasn’t good at basketball. I started rapping because I needed Adderall. || We're afraid to move on, that's why there's so much nostalgia on the internet... 'cause we don't wanna look forward, that's scary. || Also, I realized a lot of kids are listening to me. Whether I want to be or not, they're looking up to me. || I feel like… I don’t have a wife, I don’t have a kids, but… I see rappers and I’m like, I know that’s fake. I know how much you make, this is all bullshit. But people are buying into it, and you shouldn’t have that power. I’m legit trying to make honest moves so that all of us can grow. I want to make a show where my sister can work on and become a producer because she can’t get in, no one’s leting her. I want to make things where people can actually grow. A place where people can actually be honest. || Sometimes when jokes fall flat, you feel so alone. You’re like, “Well, I thought this was funny.” Sometimes you can feel really lonely. || I don’t know if this is a nerdy quality or just something left over from my uncle’s alcoholism, but I get obsessed with things very easily, things that don’t matter. I think that is a very nerdy quality to be like, “Oh this thing! I love it and I’m going to learn everything about it real soon.” || Most people think I'm Danny Glover's son when they meet me. So when they ask, I say 'No, I'm Crispin Glover's son.' Then we stare at each other for a long time. || We never went to Toys 'R' Us, we always went to fucking Auschwitz for kids - Home Depot. || NYU's like a Jurassic 5 concert: it's like there's supposed to be black people there, but they're not. || Dress like a gentleman, but my mouth is never civilized. || I don't talk soft, that's that other dude. || Urkel was retarded, let's be honest. No, he was. If there was a kid named Steve Urkel who went to your school - dressed like Steve Urkel, eating cheese all the time, always asking this girl named Laura to marry him - you'd be like, 'Oh yeah, Steve. His brother hit him in the head with a brick when he was five. Very sad situation at the Urkel house.' || They tell me that they love me... then they try to kiss me. || When I wanna be a superhero I just wake up. || I try to be me to the utmost. || It's the hand job of cereals 'cause it's like, 'This is pretty good, but you know what I really want.' || There’s just something about when kids do something, it’s always going to be funny, because kids grow up. Nobody doesn’t grow up, and whatever you do as a kid usually isn’t considered amazing when you’re an adult. A baby changing its own diaper, you’d be like, “That baby is a fucking genius.” But when he’s 27, you’re like, “He shouldn’t be wearing diapers anymore.” || L.A. is such a different place. I miss New York so much. I almost teared up when I came back and wanted a Guinness and realized I could drink it and take a cab home. I remembered that I could be a functional alcoholic in New York, like I used to be! || If you like strange, specific stuff - that's a nerd. Kanye West is a black nerd. He likes strange, specific stuff. If you go up to Kanye West and say, 'Hey, what are your favorite things?' He'll be like, 'Robots and teddy bears.' That's a nerd. || Taking a call girl to an STD fair... there's a joke here. || Me and Abed have an agreement. If one of us dies, we stage it to look like a suicide due to the unjust cancellation of Firefly. || Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait. Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date. || Careers very rarely are a waste of time; jobs usually are. || I have an obsession with books about kids with Asperger's syndrome. || I felt like high school for me was like a big whirlpool of me trying to figure out what was OK for me to do. || You’re always allowed to be better. || Why does every girl in the world wanna date me? Especially right now man, especially when I'm busy! || To all my fans who’s saying Donald Glover about to blow, just give me six months so you can say I told you so. || Black culture is a fight. We want to hold on to what we are, but sometimes the things that we are can be totally negative. You have to think: can't we try something new and not be seen as suspect? || We weren’t allowed to have any sugary cereals as a kid. The two cereals we were allowed to have were Cheerios and Kix. And Cheerios is, like, cardboard doo-doo. And Kix is kinda like the handjob of cereals… cause it’s like, ""this is pretty good… but you know what I really want…"" || When anybody pays you to be creative, you're very lucky. || If you're on Twitter, what you're saying is, 'I'm important enough for you to care what I think.' || You should be like Calvin. His best friend was a tiger, and he went on dope adventures, and if anything got in his way, he’d just pee on it. || That guy is just a mess, like God spilled a person. || People say I've changed and I tell em that I'm glad 'cause I don't wanna stay the same. || Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough. || I lost my virginity junior year of college, I was 21… I was awkward, and I was raised Jehovah’s Witness so I thought sex was bad, I thought I was going to go to hell, and get AIDS immediately. || I wanna go to rehab and compare penises with famous people. || I think it's a comedian's job to make everything funny. Nothing is off-limits. || Took the G out your waffle all you have left is your ego. || Writing is a very strenuous thing - it's like banging your head against a wall. At the end of the day, acting is better, just because nobody ever asked me if I wanted a Pellegrino in the writer's room. || An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything. || It's kind of redundant - have a black dude wearing an Obama shirt. Everybody's like, 'Yeah, we know. You like Obama; we get it.' It's just like, I would do the same thing. I realize that it's kind of redundant. I don't go up to white people wearing Coldplay shirts. 'You like Coldplay? For how long? Forever?' || We lay out our lives in a narrative we understand, like a movie, but are you enjoying making it or are you wondering ""who's watching my movie"". || Revenge is for the weak so I have settled my vendettas with all of the kids who made my early life a living hell. || A lot of the rap shows I saw as a kid were boring, but if you went to a Rage show or a Justice show, the kids were losing their minds. || But I just think I was lucky enough to figure out early on that I wanted to do comedy, so that's what I put all my effort into. || Kept looking for something to be in with. Follow someone’s blueprint. But you have to be on your own. || The only reason I'm able to do music is because I'm making money on 'Community.' If I wasn't, I couldn't pay for things. || I don’t want to be niche… I want to be as big as I can be. This album is not a rap album, I want to make pop. I don’t mean pop like Katy Perry, and I love that, I’ll play that shit at my wedding, but… Peter Gabriel’s pop, Hall & Oates was pop… but I want it to be real. || When you get called the n-word, as a black person you can do anything. It's like getting a gold star in Super Mario Brothers and junk. I hear the music when I hear the n-word. I get right into it; I get really into it. You can do anything. You could be in a fancy restaurant - just start throwing poop at the walls. People be like, 'What are you doing?' 'Someone called him the n-word.' || May your dreams be sweet and your nightmares be spooky-monster-scary and not grandma-died-scary. || Usually, if I think something is really funny, I'm not gonna test it. I'll just test it when I'm onstage. || We put stereotypes on ourselves. Everybody does that. But I think it's just a little harder for black kids to just be who they are. || I call 'Community' the best day job in the world, because between takes, I get to write music. I get to write sketches. I get to write movies. It's the best job ever. || I personally don't believe people really grow. They just learn stuff when they were a kid, and hold on to it, and that affects every relationship they have. || The thing about stand-up was, I was doing all this sketch and YouTube stuff where I was not being censored and I got to do my own thing, and it was really cool. || Twitter does have an effect on everything - things you put out there, they are out there for good. || I hate it when you really think you're getting something good... and you don't listen to your dudes when you really should. || I think the best music videos are the ones that have nothing to do with the song. Those are all my favorites. || When we were making out you kinda acted like it was nothing. Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or something. || They say my public persona don’t have enough appeal, I take a lesson from Kanye and give 'em something real. || When you think of the former high school football star, you think 6-foot-2, white, meathead as the model for that kind of character. Since I'm not 6-foot-2 or white, I just thought about what I could bring to it. I thought about Smash Williams from 'Friday Night Lights,' like the cocky quarterback, and played around with that. || When he was coming up, people were like, 'We have a serious black candidate for president. This is crazy. We have a serious black candidate.' And then when he won, they were like, 'Our first multi-racial president.' And I was like, 'That's not fair.' I mean, let's set the record straight. If you went outside tonight after this show and Barack Obama was stealing your car, you wouldn't yell, 'Hey, someone stop that mixed guy!' || I was having sex with this girl. And we were towards the end. And she goes, “Fuck me hard with that n-word dick.” And I stop… look at her right in the eye… and I came harder that I ever cum before. It was so awesome, you guys… It was almost worth being black my entire life. || Suicide is kinda dumb to me. If I wanna kill myself I will. It’s not hard to die, I could do it like right now. But why is everybody pretending like everything’s ok, Everything’s not ok. We are more connected than we’ve ever been, But I feel more alone than I’ve ever been. || I had a 'Simpsons' and 'Everybody Hates Chris' spec and I remember thinking I was never going to hear from them again. Even after meeting with Tina, I left thinking I wasn't going to get it. || Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast. So I shine bright, but I'm scared that it won't last. || My friends come and ask me ""Is it worth it?"" I say well shit it better be, I did this shit on purpose! || Why don't women have crazy men stories? I don't really hear them. And then I realized, it's because if you got a crazy boyfriend, you're going to die. Just something about men, the second they realize they're crazy, it's like, 'Time to kill everything I love.' || Made the beat then murdered it. Casey Anthony. || This one kid said something that was really bad. He said I wasn't really black cause I had a dad. || I'd much rather have AIDS than a baby... They're not that different at all. They're both expensive, you have them for the rest of your life, they're constant reminders of the mistakes you've made and once you have them, you pretty much can only date other people who have them. || My swag is always capital and live in north Virginia. || I wish I was a book. She could pick me up, flip through my pages. Make sure nobody drew wieners in me. || Girls who used to tell me I ain't cool enough now text me pics saying you can tear this up! || Black men struggle with masculinity so much. The idea that we must always be strong really presses us all down - it keeps us from growing."
Donnell Rawlings,"All my friends, all they do is drink and smoke - all they do, all day - but they're sensitive. Like after 9/11, they thought they was patriotic, you know. They telling me what their military strategy was gonna be the next day with a joint in they mouth. 'Yo son, we gonna knock them dudes out. That's my word, son.' I'm like, 'What dudes?' 'Them dudes from Assgan, son!' || Barack's in office; it feels good to be black now. When O.J. was in court it did not feel good to be black. People like, 'Are you black?' I'm like, 'I'm Creole, get out of my face.' || Live life to the fullest everyday, 'cause we never know what day will be our last. || If Elvis is alive, Tupac is alive. I saw Tupac on 46th Street selling Biggie t-shirts 2 for 10 dollars... || If opportunity doesn't knock, just build a door son. || Rise and grind... the money ain't gonna wait for you while you sleep son. || If I see an Asian person and I’m like: “Where you from?” and they’re like “Connecticut”. I’m like, “You know what I’m talking about"". || Comedy's a tough job, man. I've got friends who got cool jobs. One of my friends, he's a porno star. Guess how he got discovered? This girl sat on his lap, and she was like, 'Ooh, you should do porno!' Same girl sat on my lap and was like, 'Ooh, you should tell jokes!' || The only thing we've found since we've been in Iraq is $700 million. Remember that story? The two sergeants found $700 million in a cave. And I knew they was white boys soon as I heard they gave all that money back... If that was me, I would've reported it, but it would've been a different amount. I'm like, 'Yo yo yo, Captain! Yo, listen, we just found $48.92.' || I had a dream this girl was cheating on me! I woke up and went back to sleep to find him, he kicked my ass in my dream! || The worst person is the person that resists change. You could be that angry older guy who can be mad about it or you can embrace it. Anytime you try something different, people are going to be like, ‘That’s not how it used to be.’ It was. Guess what? That’s how it is. You have to adapt to it. You can’t be mad. || And there’s definitely no wine called Tupac Shakur. || I just had a baby girl. My daughter weighed 27 pounds. She was 3 years old. She was delivered to me by way of the court system and a blood test. || Tiger Woods is a billionaire. Do you know how much ass you can get with a billion dollars? I know guys with $20 and a pack of Newports who'd try to screw your whole neighborhood. || Ain't nobody get fired, they went in another direction. || Challenge yourself with something you know you could never do, and what you’ll find is that you can overcome anything son. || Your fans make you. In entertainment, I don’t give a shit what you think you are, you are nothing without fans. || A kid asked me for advise about getting into entertainment? I said you better know how to be happy being broke! || My feeling on entertainers that get all upset about wanting their private life, I go, ‘You chose this business.’ If you want your private life that much, stay in the house. || The best thing about where comedy is now is if you have a little bit of talent and a strong work ethic, and strong social skills, you can make a name for yourself and you can make money. || The better alternative to fighting a guy, go have sex with his girlfriend. That's how you knock a dude out! || A whale is killing people in SeaWorld. That's not funny but the headlines were funny: 'Killer Whale Kills.' What the hell do you think a killer whale's going to do? If you go to Brooklyn and see somebody named Killer Mike you don't think he'd give you no roses. || I want a black Gummi Bear. You ever see a black Gummi Bear? No, because Gummi Bears are as racist as hell. They come in every color but black. They got orange, yellow, green, invisible - come on. They must have got somebody on the candy committee like, 'We gave you niggers a jelly bean nobody eats. We're not going to take a chance on a Gummi Bear.' || When I started off in DC, you didn’t get viral first. You got funny first. || Tiger Woods is stupid; not for cheating, but for having one cell phone. What type of player you know has one cell phone? || That’s why when I talk to younger comics, and they say, ‘Well I need this and this, and I need so and so,’ I tell them they don’t need nothing. All you need is some great idea and go shoot it. || Chicks can make you flip more than any drug would."
Doug Benson,"Cat owners are so excited to demonstrate how they taught their cats to poop in the toilet, that they are making videos to share that gift with the world. Now we know what happens when people get tired of making home porn. || The thing is girls will always say you're lying when you say you had sex with them when you're lying about having sex with them. || Marijuana: why forget something tomorrow when you can forget it today? || P. Diddy's gonna be exhausted, you know, running with the Olympic torch in one hand and the torch he'll always carry for J-Lo in the other. || J-Lo finally married into her own music genre. Crappy music. || Why would any woman agree to be on a show called Bridezillas? It's not like men would agree to be on Douchegroom. || We don't want any pot-smoking vaginas because that's disgusting. And I saw it once in Indonesia, and I've never been able to get it out of my head. || I'm sitting, waiting to get on the freeway, and I'm waiting my ass off. I look over at the side of the road, and there's a hitchhiker with a sign and it says, 'Pick me up, and you can drive in the carpool lane.' I got to tell you, he was kind of smelly, but he was a good conversationalist. || If you ever go to Las Vegas, and you will, just go for a few days. I was there recently for seven days, seven days in Vegas. After I blew all my money on gambling and prostitution, I had six days to kill. || I like to go see a ball game. I'll have seven, eight, nine - 10 beers, and the second inning will roll around, and I gotta go. || I hate how all the hip hop bands of today will put crazy sound effects into their songs. You know what I mean, like a police or ambulance siren in a tune? Because I could own the CD, I could listen to it 50 gamillion times in my car - I still fall for it every time. || Even if you are 18, my advice to you is: plan for your future. || A message to parents who think legalizing weed will make their kids want to try it: they will anyway. || All marionettes are trying to say with this movie, is that if you don't see it, the sock puppets have won. || Of course the OC stands for: only Caucasian. || I was hoping Star Jones and Rosie O'Donnell sat next to each other on the View. Cause then maybe they'd get into a fight... to the death... or worse. || Everyone wants to look good in photographs, even us trolls who tell jokes. || I can hear the wheels grinding in your confrontational brains, 'If he loves movies, then why does he seem to hate every one that comes out?' Because most movies stink like 1929's garbage - a particularly bad year for garbage - that's why! If everything didn't suck, then I wouldn't hate everything. It's that simple. || People say pot smokers are lazy. I disagree. I am a multitasking pot smoker. Just the other day I was walking down the street. Stoned. OK, I won’t count that as two things. I was walking down the street. I was putting eye drops in my eyes. I was talking on my cellphone. And I was getting hit by a car. || I have been in kind of a sexual dry spell lately. In the past few years I’ve only had sex in months that end in ""arch""... in years that have an Olympics. || If I fell asleep right after sex, the prostitute might take some of my shit. || The genius' behind the new Rocky movie decided to call it Rocky Balboa so that we'll probably forget that it's number six. Or Rocky Balboa can't count past five. || In Seattle, they have a saying: ‘If you don’t like the weather, wait five minutes and then shoot yourself in the face.’ || Rappers should be forced to rhyme in their acceptance speeches. || A friend is someone I complain to about my other friends. || Big deal... the only cats that don't have three legs are the ones with two through zero legs. || Daniel Craig is having the best week ever and I don't even know who the fuck he is. || I used to make love to Green Day's music. But 9 minutes? I'm not Superman. || I immediately fire back to them; I write 'sysph.' And they write back and go, 'What does sysph mean?' And I write back, 'Shut your stinking pie hole.' || C'mon cab driver, enough with the hard braking! I'm trying to make love back here. || The great thing about being up early on a Sunday is nothing. || Just found out the hard way that the airbags in my car are quite effective. || I'll put an emoticon at the beginning of a text because I don't give a fuck. || I just jot jokes down as I think of them, and then add them to the act the next time I’m on stage. Jokes are never really “done,” because each time you perform them you can add words or nuances that weren’t there before. || I think there is much more storytelling in stand-up now. Less emphasis on the joke. Jokes are still important, but it feels like a more intimate and personal experience these days. || Stand-up is a very scary, very solitary profession, but you have to experience it to figure out if it’s right for you. || You can’t always be 100-percent positive that a joke will work, so you’ve just got to try it. Fortunately, if one new joke doesn’t work, I’ve got lots of old ones that do. Just like cops, it’s important to have backup. || I actually got pulled over once for driving in the diamond lane. Cop said to me, 'You know you have to have more than one person in the car to drive in the car pool lane.' I said, 'Check the trunk.' || You know you drank too much the night before when you wake up with crop circles in your pubes. || I made some jokes about weed, got some laughs, made some more jokes, got some more laughs; next thing you know, I’m telling a lot of jokes about it. || LL Cool J should be the spokesman for a line of pajamas called Ladies Love Cool Jammies. || Has anybody here ever been driving along in their car, smoking a cigarette, and you flick it out the window, and you drive for a few miles, and you start to smell smoke, and you turn around, and you look in the backseat, and grandma is playing with herself? || Willem Dafoe is a shithead. || I think it's a good thing that emotional scars are invisible because if emotional scars were visible porn would be disgusting. || The musical number for Crash was one of the most depressing things I've ever seen. And not because it was about racism, but because it was horrible... and about racism. || Einstein used science to get laid; that guy is a genius… I've been using money. || Tom Cruise shouldn't try to win Oscars. He should just smile and kick people in the face and leave the acting to Hugh Jackman. Why Hugh Jackman? I dunno; come up with your own example, smart-ass. || I like ""Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory"" because some children deserve to be taken to a chocolate factory and tortured. I like ""Dawn of the dead"" because you don't normally get to kill all of the zombies hanging out at the mall. || Fans of the comic book are upset that the filmmakers chose to depict Spider-Man's web shooter as organic instead of as a device created by his alter ego, Peter Parker. Fucking nerds! || It's easier to do comedy with an audience, because their reactions tell you whether or not what your saying qualifies as comedy. || My career's going pretty good. I just finished a screenplay. It's a cop buddy picture - two cops: one cop has narcolepsy, the other one has Tourette's Syndrome. It's called 'Snoozy and Spaz.' || I just broke up with my girlfriend and the reason we broke up is I caught her lying. Under another man. || What a fergalicious day were having! || Oprah didn't just bring herself, she brought her celebrity friends, because when Oprah says, ""Jump,"" they say, ""Which couch?"" || She puts the ""bra"" in abracadabra. || I was on the toilet for so long, I finally said to myself, ""I’m getting too old for this shit."""
Doug Stanhope,"At least black people knew when they were slaves; you remain clueless. || Sex is just gross. If you just break it down into what it is. It’s just disgusting. Do you ever watch porno after you cum? Ugh. || Whatever your problems are, keep in mind that you die at the end of all this. Lets get out there, brutalize ourselves and laugh at those certain pricks who take it seriously, like there is any way to win in all this. || Don't take Ambien with beer, Inman, you'll black out and fuck up all kinds of shit. || I'm like a finger in the ass; you don't know if it's going to be the best orgasm of your life or you're just going to shit the bed. || I really like Dane Cook as a person. And I want to fuck him, mentally and physically. I'll stop there before offering anymore bad puns. || I don't ever want to become Bill Maher where I have to find some strong opinion on something just because it's in the news. That's the guy that comes off like you have to be angry every week about new topics and snotty about something. That's what I'm trying to avoid. || Get the right to marry - and then don’t. || It’s not fucking ADD I’m thinking. I’m thinking about things that are more interesting than you. I’m trying to build the perfect utopian society in my head and you’re talking to me about what? Fucking bowling, I don’t give a shit.  || I’m just funnier when I’m drunk. Not falling-down drunk, just drunk enough to lose the self-doubt. || I've never tried to drive my career in any particular direction. I've always been an in-the-moment, live-for-today guy. I've never had a goal, and nearly everything I've done has been an accident. I just play to me, and if I can amuse myself, I consider it a victory. || It's simple: you legalise drugs. If all of a sudden fucking Walmart has mushrooms, pot, in a whole aisle, then there's no financial motivation for drugs gangs to be beheading people. Then proper crime and robbery, which should be illegal, we focus on that. || You are a shit head, but I can make you feel like you’re not the only shit head. || Raccoons don't need to do poppers in order to come while they're having anonymous same-sex interludes in a highway rest area. || You’re not a fan of Dale Earnhardt, you’re a fan of someone else that will take a risk so you can sit your fat faggot ass on a couch and have some slow drip morphine injection of adrenaline so you don’t have to do anything! || Your instinct is your true god. Follow it. || ""Some people just join the military because they need college money."" Then they're idiots and college wasn't going to help. || I think about suicide every fucking day of my life and I think the only thing stopping me is the lack of a perfect idea. || My life’s pretty easy, which is never good for comedy. I have a great relationship, a nice little house, a couple of dogs and cats and nice friends - there’s no jokes in that. I should fuck things up just for a business move. || ""What I've lost in years I've gained in wisdom."" Bullshit, I haven't learnt one thing in the last 15 yrs that hasn't just depressed me more. || That's why cocaine is illegal - it makes pussy too easy to get. || The next time you see a ‘hybrid’ car with a baby seat in it, smash the fucking windows out of that car, fight club style, steal the baby seat, leave a condom where the baby seat was and see if you send a message. 'Cause that's every sanctimonious cunt that thinks that they're part of the solution, when they're exact problem. || Marriage itself is an antiquated institution, it has no place in a progressive society. || Shouldn't the long-term goal of any society be complete unemployment? || You should laugh everywhere you can find even the slightest glimmer of humour. || Comedy can always be taken the wrong way. If I do a bit that is meant to diffuse racism or sexism, I'm not going to avoid it on the chance that a small portion of the audience might take it the wrong way. || Jesus died for your sins. I'm doing it for your mere entertainment dollar. || Separation of Church and State is the perineum of America and the episiotomy didn’t hold. || Sex is free fun for poor people. || I don't like when minorities tell me that I can't understand racism because I'm white. I go: ""No, you can't understand racism 'cause you're not white; I hear the shit they say about you when you leave the room! They don't hold back on my account."" || You know, the funny thing about child pornography, aside from the lack of credits at the end... || America may be the best country, but that's like being the prettiest Denny's waitress. Just because you're the best doesn't make you good. || I told my girlfriend I wanted to fuck her between the tits. She said: “How are you gonna make that feel good for me?” and I said: ""Right before I cum, I’ll stop punching you in the face."" || Democracy is the worst kind, I’m sorry but it is. “We get to pick our leaders.” Well, what if I don’t want a leader? Where does that vote go? I do good on my own, I don’t want to be led. Is that freedom? || The problem with this country is that old fucks vote. We got shit to do, old folks don't, the only thing they have to do is judge you and vote. || I immediately split the crowd. I thought about coming on every night and shouting, ""Gay pride, white power!"" just to confuse people. || I was terrified when my doctor told me that I had a unique and interesting personality trait, but then he told me about new Zoloft or Prozac and now I just take three pills a day and I blend right into this horrible inbred corporate landscape. || I'm strongly debating quitting. I don't want to create things to be angry about, I'd sooner start doing happy shit. || You know what. I didn’t ask to be here... Sue my mother. She is the one who had the fucking goal to create life without it’s consent. || There's nothing funnier than getting a death threat via MySpace. Why don't you just write it in a children's birthday card. || Did you ever try to sleep sober? || The more business gets involved, the less fun it is. || With all the horrible, horrible shit that your priest is pumping into your kid's head, his dick should be the least of your worries, honestly. That's just a little mouthwash and a few years of therapy'll get rid of that. That Jesus shit will torture you for a lifetime. || People wrestle alligators but not once has someone done it without an audience. || Do you think Americans deserve healthcare? Have you looked at this horrible fat fuck country? || I'd get demolitions experts to rig mother to implode like a skyscraper. || I’ll defend child pornography, how about that? What’s wrong with seeing some child pornography? What if you watch child pornography because you find it hilarious? Then should it not a protected freedom of speech? || I would have let a lot of people out of prison. I would start scaling back, I'd fire lots whole branches of government. I would bring troops back from every corner of the world. Politics is fucked beyond parties. With flat-form issues, people should be figuring shit out for themselves. I think I'd make a better terrorist than a president. I'm putting all my motivation into the wrong avenue. || After every school shooting, parents come on television and say: 'Rap music is the problem. And drugs. And the lack of metal detectors.' No. The problem is that a lot of your kids are aggressive dicks and you won't do shit about it. That's the problem. || You fucking work 5 days to enjoy 2, I don’t know if you gamble, but them's shit odds. || Humanity is what happened when aliens fucked apes. || Just for being a religion at all you're as complicit as the rest in the retardation of the human intellectual progress. || Coward is the most misused word in our society. || The fact is that really no comedian sets out to offend you. Some comics enjoy the challenge of taking a subject that is likely to be found offensive and trying to make it funny‚ but the object is still to make you laugh. Offense is only a calculated risk. It's highly unlikely that a comedian whose only goal was to repulse you would ever make it past an open-mic stage, far less build a long career of touring theatres and television appearances. || How does the audience fall under the illusion that they have some right to not be offended? Certainly you have the right to not be harmed; but offended? Imagine the number of subjects that might offend any single individual and multiply that by the number of people in any given audience. Subtract all those topics from any given comic's set list and what do you get? Mime. That's what you get and possibly what you deserve. I've been booed for wearing the jersey of an offending sports team and then won the audience back with rape jokes. Who can tell? || If you ever apologize to a heckler again I will rape you. || When you give to American Throat Cancer or whatever, it's almost like you're trying to buy karma. But you don't feel good about it because you know most of that is going to mailers and buying pink ribbons. When you fucking actually change a life like that, I've never felt better. That's something that, hopefully, I'll be talking about when I'm up there. || Life is like a movie, if you've sat through more than half of it and it’s sucked every second so far, it probably isn't going to get great right at the end and make it all worthwhile. None should blame you for walking out early. || I love conspiracy theories. I used to just live on it. You know it's all hype and garbage, but you're still really paranoid afterwards. It's fun entertainment. || ""Drugs support terrorism""? No, your SUV supports terrorism. || The whole institution of marriage itself really has no place in a progressive society. || Don't learn from other people's mistakes. That's the worst advice you could ever get. Other people are fucking morons. Wrestling's the number one show on cable television. You're gonna learn from their mistakes? They're fucking tools! You might be the first guy who could to do it right and be a hero for all of us. Take a chance and learn to fly there, Orville Wright! || Put your fucking camera away, you stupid fucking tourist of life! There's a whole generation of shitheads just filming every fucking thing they do. ""I'm gonna film my entire life and watch it later!"" || If I die soon, don't ever say I died too young. || Child pornography is the only crime that you cannot report to the police as an eyewitness. || If second hand smoke is killing that many people and nicotine is so addictive then why is no one addicted to second hand smoke? || I hate when your friends quit drinking on you, don't you? It's sad. I've lost more friends to AA than Liberace did to the virus. It's sad to see 'em go. You see a thirty day chip on your buddy's key ring, it's like seeing a toe tag on his cold, stiff corpse. || I was 23 with a mullet doing lots of jerk-off material.""I can't look at the old tapes now. || You have options when it comes to abortion now. It's not like 1955 when you just had to kick her down a staircase and hope for the best. || Alcohol does not make ugly people attractive. It makes it so you could care less that they're ugly. || Charlie Chaplin said something to the effect that humor is an act of defiance, that we must laugh in the face of our helplessness in the forces of nature or go insane. And where is he now? Dead. || There’s only so many pictures of yourself you can look at and hate before you have to just accept that you are a goofy looking fuck. || Your sins are what make you fantastic. It’s what makes you alive. You should wear your sins on your sleeve. You should be trying to top your sins on a daily basis. || It's thirty days since the terrorist act. George Bush has told us to go back to our normal lives and to go back to what we used to do, so I've gone back to thinking that George Bush is a soft-headed tit and a danger to all of us. || I don't have a gun. But I think they level the playing field. I accept that there's really nothing you can do about it. It's like nuclear weapons; if they exist then eventually other people are going to have them. Maybe just take away people's motivation to use them. || Why even moon a sorority girl if they can't see the swingy egg bag part of it? || They don’t encourage you to be who you wanna be, they encourage you to be what they want you to be, no teacher is gonna tell you you’d be cut out to be a great pornstar or illegal arms merchant. || Fuck that. If it's stupid, change it... If it's a dumb law, don't have it. || My audience scares the shit out of me. || Taking a leak on a tree in the great wilderness of Alaska should not be a ""who farted?"" situation. || America takes credit for giving you freedom that you had anyway. It's like going to a wedding and putting your tag on somebody elses box. || Sometimes American news is like a tired old whore that only tells you things you wanna hear. || I don't like life that much. It's not that big a deal for me... I don't want to know I have cancer till it's visible to the naked eye. || Excess in moderation: don’t drink a few beers every day after work, wait ‘till the end of the month and drink all the beers at once. || Everybody's angry. They've got nothing to be angry at, so they're angry about nothing. || I am a very mediocre intellect, at best, and I am smarter than most people I know - and that terrifies me. || We live in a world where people will have a GPS and a crucifix on the same dashboard - and you want me to have hope for these fucking monkeys on swing-sets? || America doesn't exist; it's just dirt that has fucking lines drawn around it. Old guys put lines on it at one point. It's all fucking dirt. || Every vice is already a punishment in itself... you don't need a ticket on top of it. || If I know your sexuality within the first thirty-seconds of meeting you, you're fucking annoying. || If you're going to kill yourself just do me one favor: say it was because of my act. Can you do that? I need the press. || Nothing makes you feel better inside, male or female, than when someone who shouldn't have fucked you, did. || If you've ever seen a vagina close up... it looks like an alien's gonna hop out and attach itself to your face and lay eggs in your mouth. || Right at the end of the big wall of vibrators, $29.95, big rubber fist. Thirty bucks! Just in time for mothers day. || I drank, smoked and did drugs to get where I'm at. || Steal my stuff off the internet wherever you can and don’t apologize. Buy the CDs and DVDs from my site and feel free to burn ‘em and share ‘em. Then come to the show. || Why do you believe it and what's your motivation for believing in it? I don't even believe in the shit I say for a full 24 hours. I would love to have a consistent viewpoint of my own. It would be nice to have that solid, stiff head that said, 'Well, I'm a Democrat and that's because I believe, and my parents believe, that we should have some kind of social safety net.' They don't ever look at the flaws: you get her pregnant, you marry her. That's just what you do. I'd love to have that shallow, unquestioned belief. || Nationalism does nothing but teach you how to hate people you've never met. || Comedy is like music; it builds on itself. Once someone comes up with a theory or a different way of doing things, people start to mimic it on some level. That’s why you go back to the guys you loved in the 80s… and it just seems tired now, because it was all foundation. || I drink during every show. I can’t remember the last show I did completely sober. It works for me. I use it as a tool. It’s like steroids are for athletes. I’m looser and more self-confident. If I drank less, I wouldn’t have been on stage this long. || I’m always looking for something new to say. That’s the problem with doing it for this long, thinking of what haven’t I beaten to death that I care about? You try to break yourself out of your comfort zone, because comfort is deadly for a comedian. There’s a reason why jokes start with “Don’t you hate it when…?” and not “Do you know what’s really great?” || The first thing I think of when I wake up is how close I am to death. But then it gets better during the day. || I couldn't possibly explain why the common person would be against something like that. It's all rooted in sexual hang-ups. The whole institution of marriage itself really has no place in a progressive society. I don't know why anyone would want to get married heterosexually, so why they'd be against homosexual marriage is flummoxing. I only use that word when I'm talking to someone from the British press. || I believe that everyone should be treated as an individual. Women should be treated equally in the right to vote, sure. But if I'm paying to see a comedy then I just want to see who's funniest, with everyone treated equally. I'm not going to say, 'Oh, I should see a woman this time because I saw a man last time.' It's hard to have blanket opinions. || Mutations are exciting. They try to fix 'em when they come out. Did you see the two-headed baby they killed last month when they tried to cut it apart? That was hilarious! || If you need a baby that bad, go down to the pound and get one. Not even a baby - go get an old man. There's unwanted people of all ages, pre-made and waiting for you. || ""Oh look, she smiled at me!"" It's because you shit your pants. || That place is so behind the times, you can't even get AIDS there yet. || Before you ask for the people to rise up and take what’s theirs, meet the people, because they’re really, really, bafoons. || Anything that I don’t understand or can’t do is stupid. || Unfortunately this is where comedy works, where people are the most miserable. || If you get made fun of working at Pier One Imports, you can’t pelt them with poop. || People talk to you and they try to convince you that they like what they do just because it sucks less than what they used to do… which sucked a lot. || So you stick something up your ass, and you hope it might work, and it usually helps. || Life gave you lemons and you turned it into golden showers. God bless you for that. || Two million people could die tonight and traffic would still suck in the morning. Stop spitting out the children. || The catholic church has a lot more money than any Colombian cartel and they leave a lot more bodies in their wake. || I have the kind of show that reminds you of your problems, and then I talk about other problems you didn't even know you had until tonight. || They never differentiate between drug users and drug addicts... I've done most drugs there are socially, I never had a problem. || All traditions are stupid unless you came up with it yourself. || I've had six or eight hookers in my life. I never woke up the next day thinking ""man I'm glad I got a hooker last night."" || British audiences are more polite and have a wider world view. You don’t have to put a fuck joke in every 90 seconds like you do with Americans. || Whether the reasoning for these laws is insurance costs, more opportunities for random taxation through traffic stops, curbing lost production or any other justification that could be offered, the bottom line is that it isn't governments place. You own your body. No legislation should infringe on that. || The Unbookables are supposed to be unbookable. That's what it's all about. || The Mind is everything. Do drugs. But just don't have drugs. || It was either me or Confucius that said the journey of a thousand miles begins with a vicious ass raping at airport security. || I had a girl say this to me. She goes ""you know, if god intended women to suck dick, he'd have made cum taste like chocolate"" I said ""Yeah, but he had to make it taste like bleach so you remember to do the laundry."" || The good old days; it was good because they were young but they act like it was the day. No, youth is good. That's gone. You're fucked. || Not only are the voices in your head real, but they’re accurate as well. || Pot is to narcotics what herpes is to social diseases; it doesn't count cos it's not really dangerous and it's too easy to get. || Remember the lesson that Susan Boyle taught us all. Before you judge an ugly person, give them two minutes to whistle a tune or tap dance for you. And if they can’t, fuck ‘em. Stupid ugly fuck. || Have you ever thought about registering as a sex offender just so your friends won’t bring their kids over to your house? || Don't fucking work hard you die at the end, didn't anyone ever tell you that? || I used to do boiler room telemarketing for a living, like hardcore fraud stuff that gets busted on 60 Minutes every week. || There's no such thing as addiction, there's only things that you enjoy doing more than life. || Give me tired old whore porn... I can imagine she would at least fuck you well. || I'm not saying drinking is all that great but you know it's got benefits; you can't smoke somebody pretty. || Are there any vice cops in here? You dicks. How do you do that for a living? I don't understand. I first read these stories and I think ""Don't you have real crime to fight somewhere?"" But then you think about it vice cops don't fight real crime; that's not their job. Real cops fight real crime. A vice cop's only job is to fuck up the party. || I had no musical or athletic ability, and I wasn't particularly good looking. Comedy was something I could do for attention. || The Internet has done nothing but good for comedy all around. Comedians no longer have to rely on TV execs and club owners deciding if they are funny or not. || There's a fraudulent root element of comedy in that we say things night after night as though they are rolling effortlessly from the brain and off the tongue, when in fact they are crafted over weeks and months and years. || Everything that is going to kill you is extremely appetizing. || It's our flaws who make us who we are. || I've had some bad shows where I just sucked, but I've had some assholes, too. Some guy stood up Saturday night and said 'This is the same shit you've been peddling the last five times you've been here.' That's your biggest fear: someone who knows every word you've ever said. || It seemed like a funny thing to do! I thought we could maybe get on the ticket of the Libertarian Party. But people were either amused or horrified at the idea of me representing their party. || I need you to love me, I don’t like me, either, if that helps. || In 20 years of comedy, I’ve probably had a dozen good points. || You got kids, and you want to pre-board an airplane? No. Fuck you. You wait till last. You're the problem. Let the homo pre-board. || I don't know. Both my parents are dead. So? Wait, I got pictures of their corpses in my wallet. I had them blown up as murals. Here. || Why would you die for someone's sins? Your sins are the only thing interesting about you, you dreary, bleak motherfuckers. || 'Raising awareness' is another form of doing nothing! || Who better to do drugs than high school kids; what are you going to fuck up that bad when you're seventeen years old? || When you come out of that pink ugly hole onto this planet you're nothing but a gooey shrieking wrinkled ball of weakness. || ""A national day of prayer""? Does that scare the spine out of anyone? Especially when you consider that it's all those dog-shit religions that start these fucking wars to begin with. Ninety percent of every war that's ever been fought is because of some made-up, mind control, completely fictional religion. || You forget, when you’re in the Scandinavian countries, you forget they don’t speak English first and they speak better than I do. || The ones that bother me the most are the media saying, ""He's like the next Bill Hicks."" It's supposed to be complimentary, but then all these Bill Hicks fans show up thinking you're going to be like him, and then go, ""You're no Bill Hicks."" And I'm like, ""I never wanted to try to be like him, I don't think I'm anything like him at all, and now you're mad at me for not being him because a journalist didn't have a better reference."" || They shouldn't be able to teach religion until you're 18 years old and you know what? It'd be a whole different world because if they weren't pushing that shit into your head while it was still soft you'd never buy it. || They say 'life is precious'. To who? To you, when you're young and you've got a few dollars in your pocket. Tell that to the 90-year-old lying awake at the graveyard shift in the nursing home, groaning with dementia. The only reason he hasn't killed himself is that he hasn't figured out a way he can do it with pudding. || I blow a load in a girl’s hair out of respect for the environment and mother nature, and not only do I have to pay for your kids, I gotta fucking drive past the school at 15 miles an hour on my way home to jerk off and watch the Simpsons. || A lot of the Olympic games just boil down to genetics. Michael Phelps is genetically built to swim better than other people if he trains the same way. You might as well have a competition for who’s the tallest, and act like it’s anyone’s game! || I have a picture I keep in my wallet of my father's corpse... I keep that picture in my wallet to show people who show me baby pictures. || Nobody wants to hear ""don't fuck in the front hole"" after a hard day at work. || Rooting for the Yankees is like going to a casino and rooting for the house. || I blew a speaker in my car today. Yeah, he was a motivational speaker. It left a bad taste in my mouth but I feel a lot more positive. || Democracy is the worst kind of government, I’m sorry. Would you still call yourself a Christian if they elected a new Jesus every four years? || My great great grandmother was a cunt in the late eighteen hundreds, long before it was popular to be a cunt. || ""It's the violence in the media that's the problem..."" No, the problem is a lot of your kids are dicks and you won't do shit about it. || They say if you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. But if you teach a man to fish... then he has to get a fishing license. But he doesn't have any money, so he has to get a job and enter the social security system. And he has to file taxes, and you're gonna audit the poor son of a bitch because he's not really good at math. You pull the IRS van up to his house and take everything. You take his velvet Elvis and his toothbrush and it all goes up for auction with the burden of proof on him because he forgot to carry the 1. All because he wanted to eat a fish, and he couldn't even cook the fish because you need a permit for an open flame. || Man, it just cost me five dollars to beat my own meat... God bless the United States of America. || If you're gonna have a pro-drug argument, start the argument where it starts: I have the right to do what ever the hell I want to my own body, if it kills me slowly, happy for me, fuck you. || Abortion is green! I think its irrefutable, but people don’t want to hear that. For most people, having children is an instinctual, natural desire and the last thing they want to do is believe that it has any detrimental side, or if they do believe it, they think it’s different for them because they live in a gated community or whatever the reason… || You’re born absolutely free except for laws of nature, if you drink you get drunk, that’s a law, if you get old you die, that’s a law too; if you sit on a tack you will bleed from the ass, these are the only laws that you’re born with. || Find something living rent free in your uterus? Evict that motherfucker! || If you have a good product. You don't need to advertise. You've done drugs? Did you ever see them advertised? || How do you pledge allegiance to a government? That’s all America is: a government. There’s no such thing as ‘we’re Americans.’ That’s just trivial bullshit to get you rooting for the home team. You’re not an American. You’re a guy, you’re a person, you’re an individual. || I've done coke 'til my nose was bleeding like the fourth week of Lilith Fair. || There's only two types of people who are against drugs: the people who have never done drugs and the people who really sucked at doing drugs. || Tradition and heritage are all dead people's baggage, stop carrying it. Move forward. || If you are in here and you are gay and you are offended that I'm using the word faggot, I apologize and I'll suck your dick after the show. || Life's temporary for a reason; it gets boring after a while. || Watching someone smoke when you can't is like watching porno without being able to jack off. || If people would just fuck right away and stop all the song and dance that goes with it, we could have colonies on Mars by now. || Sex is a very narrow avenue. You only have so many holes and parts, and eventually, you run out of things to do. || If God had intended women to prostitute themselves, he would have given them a free will and a vagina. || If you get offended by words - by noises we make with our mouths - it means you were raised by bad parents. || All illegal narcotics are medicinal. Boredom is a disease worse than cancer. Drugs cure it, with little or no side effects if used as directed. Life's temporary for a reason, it gets boring after awhile. || You say you hate children and people always say the same thing; ""it would be different if it was your own child."" Well what if it wasn't? || How many kids do you have? Two. Don't have any more. That's the highest acceptable point... from now on take it in the ass. || You kinda wish a girl would bleed a little bit from the head during that time so you know before you approach her at the bar. || You've done something alright with your life when the only rule on your job is don't shake your cock at the customer. || The media tells me what I find attractive in a woman? I think my dick tells me what I find attractive in a woman. || The kind of beautiful that if your life ever flashed before your eyes you'd have to stop at that part and beat off. || I understand dildos: not everybody has fifteen inches of dick to swing around to scare the children. || Raccoons don't need to do poppers in order to come while they're having anonymous same-sex interludes in a highway rest area. || I am 42 years old and I have $9000, and I am out of ideas. I've nothing to spend it on. I'm bored shitless. I will die with that $9000. || The first five times that you bang someone and the last million times are two different worlds. || If I was a freak of nature... Hell yeah I wanna do freak shows! I don't wanna be applying for jobs at the mall. || Don't get upset. I'm probably wrong about half the shit I say. || Invent new drugs, that's what you should be doing... fight to get new weirder ones... and weirder establishments to do them in. || Don't do shit you hate... there's another way... quit. Go in Monday and steel a bunch of shit and quit... and steel big shit too. || You were born free, you got fucked out of half of it and you wave a flag celebrating it. || How about a national day of get drunk and say fuck it. || Before modern medicine, would pussies just generally rot up inside you and fall out of you like spoiled oysters on the sidewalk? || Religious tolerance. No! Zero tolerance for any type of religion. || People who want to kill other people are the last people I want to party with, because I get mouthy when I drink. || I've been doing a lot of drugs in the last few weeks and drinking less, and I feel much better. || Don't eat a mushroom stem and see colors; eat the whole bag and see God one time in your life. || Do you ever wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and think, something’s not accurate? || If you ever find the perfect person, run so fast that they see flames shoot out of your ass 'cause all the perfect person does is amplify your flaws a thousand-fold. It makes you feel like that much more of a dick: I used to be a partier; now, I'm an alcoholic. It's all in who's judging. || I wish the 50 states would break up. Lose the centralised government. More choice. How do you want to live, there’s 50 different ways! You hate black people? We’ve a state for that. You wanna have an abortion? Here’s a state. I think we should just keep breaking up countries now so they become just individuals. || If I have to be a monotheist, y’know pick one, I’m picking vodka, it goes well with everything, all occasions. || Fuck you, Guardian, for calling me a liberal. || Wanting more. Having your cake or eating your cake are fine. Not even wanting cake is where you get fucked. || They should raise the alcohol age to 60, so at least you'd have something to look forward to at this point. || You never hear in the news, ""200 killed today when Atheist rebels took heavy shelling from the Agnostic stronghold in the North."" || You do bits and you fake anger and you write a bit and you have passion for it. Then you do it too many times and you have to work up the anger... and I’ve never had to do that with Dr. Drew Pintsky. Dr. Drew is to medicine what David Blaine is to science. || Alcoholics Anonymous makes scientology look credible! || I hate Sarah Palin in the same way I hate a book by its cover. It's her pandering, Fifties sitcom character persona. It is nothing to do with what she's saying because anything those people are saying is trying to dupe the masses on some level. The fact that a personality like that could be taken as anything other than cartoonish is worrying. Like Bozo the Clown, ""It's time we should all vote, kids!"" and then people saying, 'You know what, that guys really got something.' It's a fucking clown with floppy shoes and you're taking him seriously? || Children are like poems. They're beautiful - to their creators - but to others they're just silly and fucking annoying. || If you really believe death leads to eternal bliss then why are you wearing a seatbelt? || I don't think the Tea Party and Glenn Beck are responsible for one man's mental illness. Jared Lee Loughner, Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords' alleged assassin, was a psychopath. They didn't even know if the congresswoman was dead or not when they started saying that this was the result of volatile political rhetoric. What the fuck are they talking about? Every logical faction has come out and said that this psycho didn't watch the news, he wasn't a political junkie, he was far beyond that. We have to tone down political rhetoric. || I love when you get boner spam for boner pills and the subject is ""Be a better lover"". Oh, the boner was the problem on that? That’s why I’m a bad lover? Do you have a pill that’s gonna make me care if she cums? That would be a medical miracle. || Your children can’t do shit, they can’t drink, they cant smoke, they can’t drive, they can’t vote, they can’t work, they can’t fuck for god’s sake! And you wonder why your teenager’s such an asshole... it’s cuz he’s bored out of his tit! You won’t let him do anything else! || People hate people just cause they want someone different to hate. || I used to have solutions in my act. I'd find a social ill of some kind and I’d rail about it, and then have a solution to that problem. And I’d throw a fist fuck joke in the middle to make it all fit under the umbrella of comedy. And now I just have fuck it let’s just kill a bunch of people. || How dare anyone in the UK make fun of a democratically-elected leader when you have a fucking Queen? || If you tell me you are going to kill yourself, I'm not going to try to talk you out of it. || Mutations are exciting, there aren't nearly enough of them. || To the point where gender is no longer an issue; if you fuck the elephant man, no one is going to call you fag. || Artists who say that they're artists: usually people who need a job. || Even your religious friends do not want to hear about God during a medical diagnosis. || I really don't like art with a message. If you have a message that really needs to be said, just fucking say it. || I had jobs that were as short as an hour and a half. One was putting circulars into newspapers, and I worked at it for 90 minutes before I said “I’m going to the bathroom” and never came back. I never spent a lot of time at a boring job. I’d either quit, or I’d try to make it fun and they would try to fire me. When I worked for a collections agency, I’d fuck with people until it became like a Jerky Boys routine. My bosses would tell me, “You’re still supposed to get the money from them.” || I am a player in life, not an observer. I look at herpes the way you look at a scraped knee. || Humor is something men have to develop when they don’t have other skills to attract women. It’s a form of plumage that we’ve developed naturally as animals. Women don’t have to do that. You never hear a guy say, “Yeah, the first thing I want in a woman is that she’s gotta be funny.” Women aren’t funny as a rule. It’s just far more rare. || The ultimate act of cowardice is the fat-headed wrestling guy sitting behind the frail kid in math class, clipping him on the ear, saying: 'What are you going to do about that, faggot?' That is cowardice. When the bullets start flying past that jock's saucer-shaped ears, that's not cowardice. That's payback. || My mother was always the one with the dark, really filthy sense of humor. She was a vulgar woman. She used to tell me to do comedy before I even tried it. She was always up for any gag. || I do good things in my life, too. It's just that none of them are funny. || I go onstage, it's like I'm leading you into battle. You're not all going to be here at the end. || Drugs killed him, but they didn’t ruin his life by any stretch. || If you start to smell some of the shit, you start smelling all of the shit. || I think it's probably much easier to do political comedy from a two-party point of view, in that the majority have some sense of what it means to be one or the other. || Doing stand-up takes the fun out of being funny. || I have no fear of death, except I hate waiting for it. || You watch too much porno, it diminishes your taste for the kind of girls that will actually poon you. || Old people always tell you: 'When you've been around as long I have, then you can argue.' As soon as they're ripped off, it's a different story. || Don't drink on weekends either... if you are gonna feel like shit tomorrow, drink Sunday through Thursday. || I sometimes wonder if necrophiliacs are really into dead people or if they just enjoy the quiet. || You want to help mother Earth? Try sodomy. Sodomy is eco-friendly, and abortion is green. || Pussy really is the ultimate motivator of all mankind.  No, don’t clap, this is a flaw in the system! || If old people are so wise, how come they are always getting fucked by telemarketing fraud? || I don't have all the answers. I don't have a big closer, and I may not have a point.

My friend said, 'Don't judge people.' I said, 'The dude's got a knife.' He said, 'He could be a chef.' || I don't like the term 'intercourse'. I've always described sex as having taken her vagina 'into custody'. || I'd find myself more interesting if I weren't with me all the time. || If you're an adult and still think material wealth leads to happiness, might I suggest not being a moron. || Fake titties are inversely proportioned to their owners level of self esteem. This being said, part of me loves them. || I'd like you much better if you didn't like yourself so much. || Gay men greet each other just like straight guys do... If one of the straight guys saved the other one's life. || I like shitty strip clubs. They look like what they are. I know what to expect. Unlike Congress, at least we know everybody is for sale. || ""Do you love me for me""?... I don't even love me for me. || False humility is thinly veiled ego disguised as self confidence. || Domestic violence isn't funny, especially if you live together. || When being interviewed by a woman for a job, never begin with ""listen up doll face"". || We're born alone and we die alone. So in between, let's spend time with people that make us feel good... or at least put-out. || Next time I spank a girl during sex, I'll say, ""this is going to hurt me more than it will you"". || People who say ""life is precious"" don't spend much time on line at the airport. || If I ever move in with a woman, she'll have to be really comfortable with unhappiness. || America's objective in the Middle East is to create democracy in the same way that my goal on a first date to feed women. || If only you understood the way I felt... it wouldn't help much because I don't really like you as a person. || Stop thanking god for your parking spot. He had nothing to do with it, and if he did, I want nothing to do with him. || Man's inhumanity toward man is astounding, and I'm just talking about the lineup at certain comedy clubs. || Statistically speaking, when a woman says ""I'm not going to have sex with you"", she'll often have sex with you. || Few things are more negative than thinking positive for no reason. || People increase their use of the term 'sir' when their angry. Little do they know, it only causes me to feel more like I'm wearing a top hat. || Comedy is a cruel mistress, especially if you're already seeing a really cruel mistress. || Met someone who works at the zoo. Apparently the panda is a nasty animal. || I don't know about you, but I like to fall in love on Mondays. This way if things go south right away you still have the weekend. || I like Irish pubs, except for all the loud music and drinking, and people acting like idiots. || I find your lack of intelligence endearing, but not in a way that would keep me from cheating on you constantly. || Celebrated father's day by congratulating myself for not having a kid. || Health food would seem healthier if the people that sold it looked less unhealthy. || Throwing up is natures way of saying you need to re-examine your idea of a ""good time"". || I'm pretty sure whoever said, ""people are wonderful"" spent very little time with people. || Age is just a number, unless of course your trying to have a conversation with them. || Marriage is supposed to be permanent. It's like a tattoo that yells at you. || The human spirit is indomitable, unless your talking specifically about the people I know. || I'm told anal sex is like Mariachi music. It hurts at first, but you get used to it, ultimately maybe even throw on a large hat and enjoy it. || Suicide is a terrible idea, but if you're going to end it, do so at a Pinkberry near you. || Most public bathrooms now have automatic toilet sensors. People can't even be trusted to flush. || Whenever I'm around people it causes me to feel nostalgic for the loneliness that drove me into their presence in the first place. || Every time I see a happy couple I want to give them a polygraph. || Nothing good about the sun if you're trying to watch television with out curtains. || A picture is worth a thousand words, but conversations with them generally end in dissapointment. || Domestic abuse is wrong, but domestic retribution is okay. || Bad sign when the thought of your x-girlfriend sends you reeling in a search for new adjectives to describe stupidity and thoughtlessness? || I have a sneaking suspicion that leading an examined life and being really tan aren't consistent with one another. || I spend so much time alone that whenever I see my shadow I feel crowded. || It's a shame that physical beauty often has such a negative effect on its occupant. || Great marriages are like the Higgs Boson particle, its existence has been theorized, but no one has ever seen one. || Everyone I know with a kid says, ""you gotta try it""... It's not a joint. I can't just put it out in an ash tray when I'm done. || The good things in life are free, except for health care, and electricity. || People that say I have a 'fear of commitment' don't understand my relationship with popcorn. || Maybe necrophiliacs are just people that want to have sex without a lot of talking. || If space suits looked less like marshmallows, I'd be more interested in going to the moon. || Water polo would be much more interesting if they hadn't gotten rid of the horses. || Anticipation almost always exceeds the reality of that which we anticipated. || Please use anger for something positive like hurting people that deserve it or writing jokes. || The next actor I meet that uses the term 'courageous' to describe another actor's performance is getting punched in the face. || Parenthood seems really rewarding... like martyrdom, but without the glamour. || Everybody wants to be more wanted, until they are... || I'd like to expand the definition of the word 'success' to include 'failure' as the one seems inseparable from the other. || I consider myself a patriot, but not for the traditional reasons. I'm just really passionate about apple pie. || Facebook is great for getting upset about things people say even though you haven't seen them in 12 years. || Women want a man who is sensitive, but god forbid you can't get it up after being frightened by a small woodland animal. || I think you have a lot to offer... not necessarily as a person, but as an organ donor. || All politicians promise that which they cannot deliver. I just wish they did so less gleefully. || Cheerleaders are simultaneously everything that is right and wrong with the world. || If you spend a lot of time shopping for athletic clothes, you may want to consider spending less time thinking about high school. || Was thinking of taking a yoga class, then realized I wasn't gay. Whew. Close one. || I wonder if anybody ever decided to commit suicide, then thought; ""but first I'm going to stop by that taco place I like so much"". || People that say ""I'm really sensitive"" rarely are. || Skin heads are doing an awful job of promoting racism. You guys need to loosen up, and for god's sake would it kill you to smile. || In the land of the blind, the one eyed man tends to get away with date rape more often. Also shoplifting and cheating at monopoly. || Monogamy is god's way of making death seem like a more reasonable option. || Patriotism for the sake of is like choosing sides in a war based on the color of their uniforms. || Few things are as uniquely painful as bad comedy, and the realization that the human mind is a house of mirrors with no entrance and no exit. || Few things are more annoying than too many of any one ethnicity in the same room. || Saying, ""have a great work-out"" is like saying, ""I hope you pull something"". || Dating a white girl is like dating a black girl if she were really passive-agressive. || Dating is great unless you don't like horrible awkwardness, lying, and a deep foreboding sense of disappointment that never goes away. || I don't know if it's the economy, but finding work as a spiritual guru is really hard. Maybe I should grow my hair out. || There are few places more lonely than a crowded night club. || ""You can't fool the American people"" - politician trying to fool the American people. || It's difficult to feel silly and depressed at the same time, but I manage. || Misery loves company which is ironic because it rarely throws dinner parties. || My job as a comedian is to heighten awareness about locally grown produce, fight factory farming, and promote euthanasia, but in a funny way. || If I were a gynecologist, I'd say things like, ""Okay, enough of the small talk. Let's check under the hood"". || Fountains are more romantic when you don't hate the person you're with. || Mirrors at the gym only serve to remind me that I'm less of a man than I'd like to be."
Drew Carey,"Being a celebrity you always get really good seats to sporting events but you never get as good seats as the photographers get. And I really love sports. So one of the scams I have going now is I want to learn sports photography so I can get better seats at a sporting event. || Everybody in Hollywood loves symbolic gestures. || I see my face in the mirror and go, 'I'm a Halloween costume? That's what they think of me?' || But I don't want to lose touch with things like eating in Bob's Big Boy. || Even when people are rich and successful on TV shows, there's always some trouble - you have to poke holes in them, throw them out of a job, put a pie in the face. || George Carlin is kind of my template now because George Carlin before was straight laced regular comic and he had short hair, a tie, suit, nightclub guy. Then he said screw it, let his hair grow, just started telling what he thought was the truth. So that's what I'm trying to do. || 'Green Screen' was a total experiment. I'm glad we did it, but it was just tough on that network to get it going. || I do get the comics online I guess but it's such a pain. I'd rather just get them in the paper and read them. || I don't do one show and wish I was doing something else. || I don't know, people take chances on stage. It's a big free speech zone, a comedy show. So sometimes things happen, you say things that are a little bit off the edge. || I don't miss the economic insecurity, the living paycheck to paycheck. || I just try to get people to laugh - I'm not trying to change the world or anything. || I wanted to do a show based on what my life would be like if I had never become a comedian. || I'm competitive at everything. || As far as your personal goals are and what you actually want to do with your life, it should never have to do with the government. You should never depend on the government for your retirement, your financial security, for anything. || I don't care if my jokes are appropriate for a kid. || The difference between Las Vegas and Atlantic City is the difference between getting conned by a beautiful call girl and getting mugged by a crack head. || Hello. And welcome to Whose Line is it Anyway?, the show where everything's made up and the points don't matter. The points here are kind of like Canada. || Look, this is an odd question, but you're kind of cute and you're pretty nice to me. Are you drunk? It's OK if you are. || I always get screwed by the system. That's my place in the universe. I'm the system's bitch. || You can buy liquor in a drive-thru store, but you can't smoke a joint in your own damn house. || Listen, you don't know any better so I'll just tell you. You can't try to save money by not having the right beer. You know, you can skip having medical insurance, you can buy everything you own at a swap meet but the right beer is what makes living like this possible. || I'm Drew Carey, and just like the Muppets, I've got someone's hand up my butt. || I think that if anyone bothered to take a survey, they would find a sharp decline in atheism during the winters in Cleveland, Ohio. || I loved the old stories in National Lampoon, like the original story the movie Vacation was based on. I used to laugh at them until I cried. || Everybody in Hollywood loves symbolic gestures. || Thousand points for everybody! Usually a thousand, but for you, nine ninety-nine! Nine ninety-nine! I'm giving the points away, only nine ninety-nine! I'm craaaazy! || The economy is in trouble, schools are in trouble, and people have been leaving the city in droves for a long, long time. || They say that exercise and proper diet are the keys to a longer life, Oh well. || Eating crappy food isn't a reward - it's a punishment. || Hollywood people are filled with guilt: white guilt, liberal guilt, money guilt. They feel bad that they're so rich, they feel they don't work that much for all that money - and they don't, for the amount of money they make. || When I thought I was retired, I wanted to travel around the world and watch soccer games. || TV is easier: it's all planned out for you and the audience is there to see a show and they are all pumped up but when you are in a comedy club, you have to be really funny to win them over. || I've always got stuff in my head in case I meet somebody like Steven Spielberg or someone like that, where I can hopefully say something to them that nobody else has ever said and get a laugh out of them. || Libertarians are essentially what the Republicans were 30 years ago. Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan. They'd all fit more under the Libertarian label than the modern day Republican label. || Nevada's one of the most conservative states in the Union, but you can do what you want in Vegas and nobody judges you. || The TV season is a year-long thing now, and the networks are starting to look at it that way, thanks to cable, satellites, and competition. || Yeah, apparently chasing a bus uses different muscles than sitting and eating. || I remember when I took a temp job... so I got a job at a department store. Something temporary to put on my resume, my parents said. Yeah... till I die! || I can't do that. I'm already the single guy living in his parents' house. I can't be seen digging a grave in the middle of the night. || I don't get it, how does a guy look at his girlfriend without doubling over? || Wow! Another steaming pile of good news! || Well, you can huff... and you can puff... and... oh my god! I'm making a pig joke out of myself! || Hey, don't waste cheese. If you're going to waste food, throw a vegetable. || I've got to say that I don't see myself as some sort of political type like Alec Baldwin or Barbra Streisand. I don't want to come across like that. || When I'm working, I'm going to avoid all media. No newspapers, no magazines, no movies, no radio, no TV. I'm just going to do creative work. || I honestly think that it automatically hurts me if I said that I supported the war in Iraq and I support the troops. That automatically kills me for getting a bunch of movies, a bunch of TV shows. People don't want to hear from me. || It should be up to each bar owner and patron to decide if they want to smoke or not. || We'll never see national shows with 45 shares again. || I'm competitive at everything. || And for you kids watching at home, remember, the less homework you do and the closer you sit to the TV, the more points you get. || As far as exercising goes... watch for my next book, How I died while Jogging. || Thanks Kate, and don't forget to call that number, there is no such thing as a little crack problem. || The hardest diet I was ever on was the one when I was fat. You can only wear fat clothes, you dont feel good, your sex life gets damaged, you dont have energy for anything. Its horrible. || As you know, I'm from Cleveland, Ohio. I love Cleveland, Ohio. I based my whole career on being from Cleveland, Ohio. And you also might know that Cleveland, Ohio, is going through some tough times right now. || I always thought I was going to die before I was 60. || After all, game shows are not like working in a coal mine. || When asked if he enjoys being famous: Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. I've always been a people watcher. I like to go to malls and just sit, and I can't do that very easily anymore. || Some people are like Slinkies - not really good for anything, but you still can't help but smile when you see one tumble down the stairs. || I can't think of a worse place to be, without a passport, without any money, ... Then you'd be really screwed. || Funniest thing happened though, you wouldn't believe it, ha, the mannequins came to life. I went insane. || I was in the band when I was a kid, I played the trumpet. || Has anyone ever tested your makeup for lead? || One of these days I'm going to bite you and I'm gonna get very, very sick. || I'm not taking the bus today. I thought I'd try something different, I'm going to throw myself in front of it. || I looked at game show hosting as the bottom of the totem pole, one step away from infomercials. I never watched them myself. However, it's been a lot of fun. We try out new things and keep a lot of the classic elements people remember. I enjoy getting to know new people and seeing them win. || Hey, can we take a picture of you guys for our dart board? || I have a position of indirect respect and oblique power. || If frogs could fly... well we'd still be in this mess, but wouldn't it be neat? || It sucks being fat, you know. || When I did Comic Relief, I did it to be on the show; it's a badge of honor as a comedian to do that show. || The Marines gave me a really strong sense of discipline and a work ethic that kicks in at my job. || The first Monopoly game I played with my brothers, I hated losing so much, I just had to beat them. || Boy, a drive-through liquor store. God bless America! A place where you can drive through and buy whiskey, beer... just the thing for that drunk driver who's constantly on the go. Cant stop now! I've got places to go, people to hit! || Like I said, all comedy is based on exaggeration, big or small, whatever you can get away with. || I'm not against ratings per se. I think more information is always good. But I certainly don't think the government has to step in and set guidelines for how shows should be rated. || I love Las Vegas. I like that Las Vegas has everything. Everything and anything you want to do, you can do in Las Vegas. || I just liked stand-up comedy so much. I used to memorize Bill Cosby albums and other people's albums, George Carlin, Flip Wilson. || No Faith! At least wait a few minutes until rush hour is over. You're wearing a teddy bear backpack, everyone is gonna want to hit ya. || What right does a politician have to tell me what I can and cannot watch? Change the channel if you don't like what's on TV! || I'm getting drunk, watching Sabrina and wondering if 9:30 is too early to go to bed. || Liquor prohibition led to the rise of organized crime in America, and drug prohibition has led to the rise of the gang problems we have now. || Oh, and once, when I was in the Marines, I got a perfect score on my physical fitness test. || Violence doesn't solve anything? World War I. World War II. Star Wars. Every Super Bowl. Who says violence doesn't solve anything? || The laughs are honestly bigger, ... They are the kind of unexpected belly laughs you get with your friends during conversation. || This is how youre supposed to feel every day. This is what I should have felt like my whole life! I always thought I was going to die before I was 60. My father died of a heart attack in his 40s. Im not an idiot. The writing was on the wall. || I didn't see it coming, ... But Comedy Central wanted to do it and will air all 13 shows that we did. That's why I'm going out on this tour. If the show wasn't picked up, I would probably be flying off to a sporting event or something in October. I wanted to take a couple of years off, but that will have to wait because of the show and the tour. || I love the normalcy of Cleveland. There's regular people there. || Just because a guy has a shaved head, pierced nipples, and doesn't have sex with women doesn't make him gay. It just makes him down on his luck. || I used to go to the Cleveland Comedy Club all the time. If there was a comic I liked, I'd go see him two or three times that week. Bob Saget was one of those guys. || The people of Cleveland hate soccer. But it's my favourite thing and I follow the U.S. men's national team around when they play whenever I can. || I had no problem going into retirement mode, ... I do what other retired guys do. I putter around the house and travel. || One day I was running around playing with my son Connor when afterwards I was sweating, tired and out of breath. I was embarrassed that something as enjoyable as playing with my son was so tough for me to do. Immediately I started an extensive diet and exercise plan. It completely changed my life and helped cure my Type-2 diabetes. || I never thought I was a libertarian until I picked up Reason magazine and realized I agree with everything they had printed. || The only way I'd need a pain reliever to enjoy sex is if all of my fantasies came true at the same time. || In any other job, they're truck drivers. In show-biz, they're ""Transportation Captains."" || If you want to play the ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" home game, just send us a million dollars, and we'll send you a desk and four stools. || I took another swig of brain-cell-be-gone and tried to act calm. || But sports photography isn't something you just pick up overnight. You can't do it once a year for fun and expect to do a good job. And I take pride in what I do. || My mind was a mess back then as I drove across the country. I was driving to clear my head, and all I could do was obsess on my uncertain future. It's like you're at a crap game, and on your biggest roll, the dice go in slow motion. For months, you watch them spin and roll and bounce around, waiting for them to land so you know if you're a winner or a loser. Total limbo. || Weirdo. Weirdo. Underachiever. Weirdo. Weirdo. || I like to think of my house as nothing more than a glorified console for my television; the ultimate stereo cabinet. || Hey, here's a tip for you: The next time you have the world by the balls, don't twist them. || Every election I have to hold my nose to vote. || Oh, you hate your job? Why didn't you say so? There's a support group for that. It's called everybody, and they meet at the bar. || I'm sorry if my friends make a bad impression, but it's an accurate one. || Man, what a rough night I had. My inflatable girlfriend ran off with my air matress. || Nothing's funny about someone who's successful. || If I wasn't a comic or TV star, I really wanted to be a photojournalist. || There's no way I can justify my salary level, but I'm learning to live with it. || That's the great thing about having your friends around you. I've known these guys forever. I really enjoy their company just as people. You couldn't ask for a better work environment. || Some people don't like competition because it makes them work harder, better. || People laugh to forget their troubles, and to forget their troubles they like to look at people who aren't doing better than they are. || Vegas is everything that's right with America. You can do whatever you want, 24 hours a day. They've effectively legalized everything there. || We'll never see national shows with 45 shares again. || What also helps our show is that we never take ourselves seriously. || The Marines was a fresh start - that is why they shave your head. I wish they would let you change your name. || There's a game called Checkout where there's grocery items and it's how much you think the manufacturer's suggested retail price is and we add up your total, then your total has to be within $2 of the regular total. I don't think I could ever win that game. || When I play poker, I don't like losing the pot. || My fans are pretty normal, they are always really nice and polite, and they don't interrupt my meals. || When the show's in production, we work for three weeks at a time and then take a week off. || You know that look women get when they want sex? Me neither. || It isn't premarital sex if you have no intention of getting married. || I think a lot of people are afraid of freedom. They want their lives to be controlled, to be put into a box... People like that cradle-to-grave concept because it says you don't have to think too much, you don't have to worry too much, because someone else is looking out for you. But that also means you can't do as much as you want. Why should someone else put a limit on how much fun I can have; how much I can accomplish?"
Earthquake,"My brother got fired for coming late at a night job. How you oversleep 8:30? || Don't want to go down to Alabama. It's hot down there - slave heat. It was like 98 degrees at three in the morning. I was like, Alabama must got their own sun. I was hiding from the sun like it was the police. || Marriage is like having cable with just one channel: same thing come on everyday. You see other things come on, but you can't watch it. || I know how to get sisters. I got 30 years practicing that. All you got to do is go to the club and say, 'I got that rent money.' || You don't want to go down to Alabama. It's primitive. Don't take your phone down there - ain't no AT&T, ain't no Sprint. They call each other the old fashioned way: they use pigeons. || I don't know what to tell a brother without no future. What do you tell him? What do you say on the phone? Keep your head up and your ass down. || I love black women: burnt black, slave black. I love my woman so black, I just like her to lay in the bed, look like a hole in the sheets. || Ain't no black people don't fuck with no bombs. We don't fit that profile. 'Cause you've got to be on time with a bomb. || I bought a house. I spent $300,000 for it. Now it’s only worth $100,000. But I owe $500,000. I done refinance my house so many times, I don’t even own the gate. || You give a white kid some napkins and duck sauce, they'll make a bomb. || Used to go to church, but church is getting too expensive. Cover charge is a bitch. I went one Sunday; they was passing around eight, nine plates. I just pulled my own plate, started passing that around. || I got a boy that was married, been married for six years - videotaped his wedding day, never watched it. Six years later, now he watches it every day, but he watches it in reverse. I asked him. He said, 'I love seeing myself take that ring back off her fuckin' finger.' || I know who wasn't black - I don't care what nobody say - Noah was not black. Noah and his family couldn't have been black 'cause there's no way no black family was on no boat for 40 days and 40 nights and didn't eat them two chickens. || I'll get God his money when I see him. And if he asked me why I was holding onto it, I say, 'Well, there's a lot of false prophets on Earth. I didn't know who to give your money to, and I didn't want to give it to the wrong person and still owe you when I got up here. Ain't no sense in paying if I didn't make the list, 'cause I'm gonna need that money for cold water and an air conditioner.' || I've been to jail, but I do little stuff for little time. I go to jail for stuff like eating in the supermarket. Don't laugh - all of us do this stuff. I'm the only brother who got caught. || Some of you are just lying! There's no way you would let your woman freely see your phone. || At least drug dealers have some integrity. There is no integrity when it comes to entertainment. || I don't know who you niggas are talking about ""let's go back to Africa."" But after seeing Hotel Rwanda and Blood Diamond, you can sell my ticket! I'm staying right here. I'll take my chances with the Klan. I can outrun a fat redneck, but I can't outrun no Tutu. || I have to be legitimate in my lyrics to be genuine. If I constantly made up stuff, soon enough I would run out a fuel because there is but so much jokes you can come up with. You have to use real experiences so people can relate. || White people talking about how Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves. No he didn't; polyester did. They stopped wearing cotton; they had to let us go. || Some people say that Jesus was black. I don't know if that's true or not, but that would explain why it's taking him so long to come back. || Best job I ever had was working in the cleaners. That was a good job. I cried like a bitch when they fired me. They fired me for wearing other people's clothes. || I got kids - got three kids: two of them mine, one of them don't look like me. I was gonna get a blood test, but that costs $2500. I said I'll wait 'til he falls down and cuts himself. || White people don't forget shit. 'Cause the next brother Johnny Cochran would have represented would have got all O.J.'s time. ""Double life? For speeding? You bullshittin'!"" || I was going to get me a white woman, but O.J. messed it up for everybody. He set interracial dating back a thousand years. || Black people late by nature. There's some slaves still on their way over here."
Eddie Griffin,"I think some teams shied away because of it, ... But Minnesota stuck with me and I was happy about that. || Actually it broke my heart to hear that we were going to have to part ways, ... It's a business and they had to do what they had to do. || He's been on vacation for a year and month. Captain Kirk never left the helm when the Enterprise was under attack. || It was awkward and embarrassing, but you have to go through things, ... I got through it and I'm happy it's over with and I can move forward and start playing. || One plus one equals three. When a man and woman marry they become one never two. || Do unto others as you would've them do unto you. Scientific prove that to be a fact for every action is the opposite as equal reaction. Don't fuck with me, and i won't fuck with you. || We live in a three dimensional plane. Life is on the third planet from the sun not the second. Ain't nobody lying on a piece of paper looking at each other. || We've lost a bunch on the road, I don't even know how many. It's a relief to get this one. || There's only three major elements. Air, land, which is your flesh and water, which is your blood. You're walking on a third of yourself. She's called Mother Earth. She gave birth to your ass. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, your maggot food ass going right back to her! || In Europe, kids learn at least four languages before they're out of high school. But our education system is so underfunded, they go to school to buy heroin and an AK-47. || Y'all can relax about that Osama bin Laden shit coz I'm a handle the shit myself. Coz I can't understand how they can't find the motherfucker, six foot six with a nappy beard and a towel on his head, while they can find my cousin four foot eleven in Compton. Nigga worth half a billion dollars, just look for the cave with the satellite hook up, if there's a Rolls Royce parked in front of the cave, nigga probably in there. You walk in and there's velvet paintings of Saddam Hussein, I think the nigga in there, I mean who do they got looking for this guy Colon Powell? || Nobody ever had to tell you it's wrong to kill your mama. Somehow you born innately knowin' that. Which means you born knowin' right and wrong so put the book down. Cause it will fuck you up. || Makes no matter if I'm performing in a grocery store, you're always gonna get 150%. || It's definitely a relief that it's over. It's been a long season for us, with ups and downs. But we're going to put it behind us now and we've got to try and be a better team. || The war is really about religion. The war's between Jesus and Muhammad. The Christians say Jesus is the messenger. Muslims say Muhammad is the messenger. Who gives a expletive who the messenger is did you get the message? || You know how we built the pyramids? You gotta ask yourself a question always flip the script. What if up was down and down was up? What if you looked down into space standing up on Earth? This is how we built the pyramids. || It was frustrating because I didn't do anything, ... I was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and he decided to punish me. I couldn't do anything about it. || My cell phone fell off my lap. I was reaching for it in the back. || You give me 5 Bloods, 5 Crips 4 Mexicans and 3 rednecks, this shit would have been over. Niggas and Mexicans, we go over there and steal all the tracks off their tanks, them tanks will be on bricks. We come back home like ""Who want some tank tracks?"". And y'all know rednecks love hunting , a redneck you give that nigga rifle with a scope he can hit a fly off a deer's ear from 500 yards. They don't fuck around and they all have a hunting dog named Petey, you know them pointer motherfuckers. You drop them in Afghanistan Petey gonna point at the right cave ""Mofucker in there, motherfucker in there!! I smell him!!"". || We're living in the time of AIDS. It's rough being skinny with that shit. Women be looking at you like, ""I don't know. You awfully thin."" || I believe God wrote the Word in your essence. That's the genius of my Father. You are born knowing right from wrong. You don't need a book to tell you that! || That definitely went through my mind, ... The situation in Houston, I felt teams were going to shy away from me because of the stuff with me."
Eddie Izzard,"They went to the Moon and they brought back rock. Trouble is, we've got rock. That was the one thing we didn't need, wasn't it? ""Rock, Neil? I don't know whether you looked at the planet before you took off, but it's made of fucking rock!"" ""But it's Moon rock …"" ""Oh, fucking hell, this is Earth rock, Neil, come on! Have you heard, on the stock market, rock's gone up three points? No, it hasn't, has it? 'Cause it's fucking rock!"" || I like my coffee like I like my women. In a plastic cup. || Agatha Christie? We go back years, me and Ag. She's a … she's just a … she's dead, isn't she? || They say the Universe started with a big bang. I hope everybody stood well back. || We have archeology on television, and I quite like it; it’s a sort of detective thing, but it’s really true, you know it’s there… But it’s kind of slow on telly, it has this problem of, “We’ve been here three weeks on live television, and we’ve taken off about a millimeter of top soil so far…” There’s men with brushes and beards… maybe they’ve just got beards, I’m not sure… “We found this and carbon-dated it to last Tuesday, so we’re very excited…” || This is your captain speaking. Welcome aboard flight...one, from...here to there. We'll be cruising at a height of ten feet, going up to twelve and a half feet if we see anything big. And our copilot today is a flask of coffee. || Oh, I'm not allowed to do anything. Well fuck off then. If your not going to do anything then what's the use, just piss off. Stop asking us to mumble things on Sundays. || I did bronze survival swimming. I could save people in a bronzey kind of way. || You're gay, you sell books... you probably shag the books. || Some people are widely read. I'm thinly read. || It's a historical thing, up to the 19th century the English hated the French. Then in the 20th century the English started to hate the Germans - as we began to move alphabetically through the map of the world. Now, the year 2000, we are fine with the Germans… but the Hungarians are pissing us off. || But in the Olympics, in the last Olympics, we, Britain, didn't do very well, got no gold medals at all, which pissed me off. But we're setting up a British Olympics, where each and every event is a British event, like the British hundred metres: ""Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me… I think I was here first!"" We should win that. || There was Pope John if you remember, now there is Pope John Paul. The next Pope's gonna be John Paul George and we can see where they're going. || You have no control over your cat! You can't say to your cat, ""Cat, heel! Stay! Wait! Lie down! Roll over!"" 'Cause the cat's just gonna be sitting there going, ""Interesting words … have you finished?"" While you're shouting all this to your cat, your dog's next to you, going … ""What the hell are you doing? I'm talking to the cat!"" ""Oh, I'm sorry!"" || In my first year I was taught about the slide rule. They said, ""The slide rule is important. Without it you can do nothing. The slide rule is the modern weapon of efficiency. With the slide rule you can get from here to the stars. Buy it, use it – your slide rule!"" Within one year it was, ""Burn the slide rule. The calculator can add up with none of this fucking sliding the shit around and working out where that bit in the middle goes. Smash it over your head."" || Makeup's just crazy, anyways. Native Americans used to wear it, and it did all right for them until, uh … well, until you killed them all, I suppose. || It’s a secret, religious, weird, ceremonial rite of passage for girls that women know. Hopscotch, it was bizarre for boys, ‘cause they never played it, and as a boy, I was behind walls, going, “What- what happened? What did they do? What do they do here?” And they had a track laid out with numbers, mystic numbers- 1, 5… 7, 8, you know… A bit of a broken doll there, some girl keeping lookout with a skipping rope… || You're going to eat that later? You're going to take it home? || There's not much makeup in the army, is there? No. They only have that nighttime look, and that's a bit slapdash, isn't it? || They tend to come out a colour called 'Pants left in wash' || And then earlier than that there were the crusades. The crusades were totally fucked. Richard the Lionheart, who had the heart of a lion as well as his own. He ripped it out of the lion, and the lion was left with a bicycle pump and not much to do. || If you commit perjury I don't care. Don't give a shit. I don't think you should because you grade murder. You have murder One. Murder Two. You realize that there can be a difference in the level of murder. So there must be a difference in the level of perjury. Perjury One is when you're saying there's no Holocaust when, you know, 10 million people have died in it, and Perjury Nine, is when you said you shagged someone and you didn't. || If there is a God, his plan is very similar to someone not having a plan. || I just believe in the goodwill of people, the power of people to do something positive. || Cats have a scam going - you buy the food, they eat the food, they go away; that's the deal. || I wanna live 'til I die, no more, no less. || They tend to come out a colour called 'Pants left in wash'. || Animals in the wild are lean, and I think we should be too. || I use a Bruce Lee technique: 'The way of no way.' He had the idea that he would learn everything, so that whoever he had to fight, he could improvise anything. The best way of starting a gig is just to not think of anything - to clear your mind, not in an empty Zen state, but more just to go on and see where you go. || Queen Victoria, one of our more frumpy Queen’s. They’re all frumpy aren’t they? Because it’s a bad idea when cousin’s marry. || There was no religion in my life growing up. Did God invent us or did we invent God? || So then there was the Greek, Socrates, he was great... He invented questioning. Before Socrates, no questioning. Everyone sort of went, ""Yeah, I suppose so."" || Socrates was killed… by his own people. He was! Coz he questioned everything… ‘When is a house a house?’ ‘Just chill-out will you?’ ‘If I’m out of the house am I chilling-out? Am I chilling-in if I’m in the house? Ugg, ahhh.’ ‘What is a sword? Is it made of folded metal?' 'If I die on the floor can I get up in these heels?’ || I grew up in the 70s, when the careers advisor used to come to school, and he used to get the kids together and say, 'Look, I advise you to get a career, what can I say? That's it.' || Mr. Charles Darwin, who looked a bit like God which is interesting, wrote a book called You're a Fucking Money, Mate. He played around with the title for a while: We're All Fucking Monkeys; You're a Fucking Monkey, Mate; Get Out of My Face, You Fucking Monkey. And he ended up with On The Origin of Species. || Picasso, he should have been a taxidermist! “I’ve done your dog. It’s got nine eyes down the side, I made his head all square, 15 legs. What do you think of that?” “Fido looks a bit weird.” || You say 'erbs', and we say 'herbs', because there's a fucking 'H' in it! || What I'm talking about is blasphemy! Blasphe-you! Blasphe-everybody in the room!... hm. 6 person joke, that. There we go. || Words like ""kiosk"", that’s a Viking word and it came from when they would rape and pillage… 'cause they would rape and pillage and awful and blood everywhere and limbs hacked and money stolen, and then they’d say: ""If you have enjoyed today’s experience, you can get some souvenirs in the kiosk which is just down on the beach. Thank you, thank you."" || You know, Catholicism, we believed in the teachings of Cathol, and everything it stood for... || You killed a hundred thousand people? You must get up very early in the morning! I can't even get down the gym! || Today's sermon is taken from a magazine that I found... that I found in a hedge. This season's lipstick colours will be in the frosted pink area - and nails to match... and this reminds me rather of our lord Jesus. Because, surely, when Jesus rode into town on a donkey... he must have gotten tarted up a bit. || Hitler ended up in a ditch covered in petrol on fire... so, that's fun. And that's funny. Because he was a mass-murdering fuckhead! || I like my coffee hot and strong, like I like my women, hot and strong... with a spoon in them. || Hitler ended up in a ditch covered in petrol on fire... so, that's fun. And that's funny. Because he was a mass-murdering fuckhead! || Cause you think we all live in castles. And we do all live in castles. We got a castle each. We’re up to here with fuckin’ castles. We just long for a bungalow or something. || Martin Luther was a German fellow who pinned a note on a church door that said, ""Hang on a minute!"" Actually, he was German so, ""Ein minuten bitter!"" || Shooting clay pigeons, I think, yeah, go for that. Shooting clay, clay pigeons are fuckers! Come round your house, whiz through, ""fwhooo, fwhooo, fwhooo!"" They do nothing.. they don't even eat... flies!  || Cause if you're a transvestite, you're actually a male tomboy, that's where the sexuality is. Yeah, it's not drag queen, no; gay men have got that covered. This is male tomboy, and people do get that mixed up, they put transvestite there - no no no no! Little bit of a crowbar separation, thank you! And gay men, I think, would agree. It's male lesbian, that's really where it is, ok? Because… it's true! ‘Cause most transvestites fancy girls, fancy women. So that's where it is. || They’re not women’s clothes. They’re my clothes. I bought them. || So … uh … I'd better explain the tits. Um … didn't have those at school. Wanted to, but not in the school curriculum … even though I asked. || Father, bless me for I have sinned, I did an original sin… I poked a badger with a spoon. || My sexuality is straight transvestite or male lesbian. It seems we are beyond the idea that I am gay and hiding it. If I had to describe how I feel in my head, I'd say I'm a complete boy plus half a girl. I don't seem to have the sixth sense that women have or their stronger senses of taste and smell. Gay men can also have it but straight men don't. || My Gran said put a thimble on your finger and it helps you in case you slip with the needle and it goes up, into the brain, and death. || The same people who make toasters make showers. For they have a turney button too that lies. For we all know turn turn turn turn for hot. Turn turn turn turn for cold. But the only position we're interested in is the position between there... and there. One nanomillimeter between fantastically hot, and fucking freezing. || So then God created the world, and on the first day he created light and air and fish and jam and soup and potatoes and haircuts and arguments and small things and rabbits and people with noses and jam – more jam, perhaps – and soot and flies and tobogganing and showers and toasters and grandmothers and, uh … Belgium. And the second day he created fire and water and eggnog and radiators and lights and Burma and things that go ""urh"" and … and Colonel Gaddafi and Arthur Negus. On the third day he probably got lists and said, ""I can't remember what I've invented now. I've just been ad-libbing so far."" || He did apologise for the Spanish Inquisition. He said it was far too inquisitive. Supposed to be the Spanish Casual Chat. || Because we all know one of the main factors of war is the element of surprise. And what could be more surprising than the First Batallion Transvestite Brigade? Airborne Wing. || Cos people think I'm on drugs and I'm not. I'm really quite... Just a bit of coffee. When I take drugs I start going, ""Oh, would you like insurance?"" || I had to go see a chiropractor in New York. And they're different from osteopaths because of the spelling. Of course, they're both very powerful figures on the Scrabble board, though. ""Chiropractor. Chiropractor. Ninety-three letters, 'chiropractor.'"" || When you're more mature, you do start telling the truth, in odd situations. ""I'm sorry, I've broken a glass here. Is that expensive? I'll pay for it. I'm sorry."" And you do that so that people in the room might go, ""What a strong personality that person has. I like to have sex with people with strong personalities."" || I think on the seventh day, God was running around, going, “Oh, my God! What haven’t I…? Rwanda! I better create Rwanda! Sorry, haven’t quite done that… The Tower of Pisa! Oh, it’s leaning… Oh, shi… done! Toilets in French camping sites… there we go. English football hooligans… there we go, whatever that is… Mrs. Thatcher’s heart… there we go… oh, fuck that! I know, I’ll put a stone in, that’ll work! There we go…” The next week, I think, people are coming back, going, “Rwanda doesn't work very well; infrastructure’s fucked.” || Would you look over there, there's a badger with a gun... can you see? Then new queue! You're in there! || And Henry VIII, a big hairy king, went up to the Pope and said, ""Mr. Pope! I'm gonna marry my first wife, then I'm gonna divorce her. Now, I know what you're gonna say, but stick with me. My story gets better. Second wife, I'm gonna kill her! Cut her head off. Ah, not expecting that, are we? Third wife gonna shoot her. Fourth wife, put her in a bag. Fifth wife, into outer space. Sixth wife, on a rotissamat. Seventh wife, made out of jam..."" and the Pope is saying, ""You crazy bugger! You can't do all this, what are you a Mormon? It's illegal. What have you been reading? The gospel according to St. Bastard?"" || Pol Pot killed one point seven million Cambodians, died under house arrest, well done there. Stalin killed many millions, died in his bed, aged seventy-two, well done indeed. And the reason we let them get away with it is they killed their own people. And we're sort of fine with that. Hitler killed people next door. Oh, stupid man. After a couple of years we won't stand for that, will we? || I'm an action transvestite really, so it's running, jumping, climbing trees... putting on make-up when you're up there! || It proves that we're all from Africa, you see. Proved through the Y chromosome and through the mitochondrial DNA that we're all African, which is brilliant 'cause it means that racist people can retire. || When you're coming out, you have to deal with the whole world saying 'Oh! You're an abominable snowman'. || You say, ""Do you want a cup of coffee?"" and she says, ""Yeah, okay."" Then sex is on, yes? Doesn't always work, though. If the President of Barundi says do you want a cup of coffee... || What? … The Carthaginians are attacking? God, I knew they'd do that. What? … They are attacking over the Alps? Damn, I knew they'd do that. What? … They're coming on elephants? … Where'd they get the elephants? There aren't any elephants in Europe. This I got to see … are you sure? … It's not just a typo mistake? Perhaps the Carthaginians are attacking over the Alps and they are in their element? Kind of upbeat, you know. They're coming on fucking elephants, huh. || Boy bands should be exploded from a great height. They're just pretty people singing music written by others. || I don't know what it's like in the U.S. but immigrants in the U.K. do the jobs the citizens won't do. || I don't believe that competitions are important. || I felt audiences are happier to take comedy people who play darker people because there's a link between the psychosis of comedy and the psychosis of being a twisted character. || I mean, sometimes... a comedian becomes an actor, and they just don't deliver, because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny, and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful, and they get that mixed up sometimes, or don't even notice that that's the thing. || I try to just talk about human stories and what I think about religion or teapots or whatever. || I try to keep performing as much as possible - I just like to. I used to take huge gaps off between gigs, now I just like to do stand-up gigs as much as I can. || I wanted to be less well-known in comedy. || I'd be happy to be taken as a woman - and that's what I was initially trying to do when I started throwing on dresses and stuff. But that wasn't going to happen because everyone kept calling me sir. So I thought I'd change the method and just start wearing what I wanted to wear. || I'm quite good at taking in information so I voraciously inhale Wikipedia - which may have some things wrong in it, but I think is generally more information than we had before. Last tour we didn't have Wikipedia. And then Discovery Channel and History Channel. I can take it in and retain what I think are the most important facts. || If you get anything creative going, then the work and play thing is the same thing, I feel. || In stand-up it really helps to play yourself and talk about your own feelings. You cannot fail to be original if you're just talking about what you think about X, Y and Z. Unless you've got a twin brother who's also a stand-up. || My stand-up is quite good now, people say. It's just like a big conversation each time. Every gig is a rehearsal. || Well, comedy is a great weapon of attack. It's not a great weapon of support. || So in Europe, we had empires. Everyone had them - France and Spain and Britain and Turkey! The Ottoman Empire, full of furniture for some reason. And the Austro-Hungarian Empire, famous for fuck all! Yes, all they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard. || Squirrels always eat nuts with two hands, always two hands, ""arararar"", and occasionally, they stop and go, oh, uh, ah, as if they're going, ""Did I leave the gas on? No! I'm, no I'm a fucking squirrel!"" And occasionally they go, ""Fucking nuts! Fed up with them always. I long for a grapefruit.” || We have two hundred languages in Europe. Two hundred languages! Count them! I know you won't! || Before birds get sucked into jet engines, do they ever think, ""Is that Rod Stewart in first class?"" || Oh, Captain Clever! Rattle it, if it doesn't go off it can't be a bomb! || For those of you who don't speak French, by the way, all of that was fucking funny. || So I've learnt that the world is 4500 million years old. If you're very religious, then it's not 4500 million years old, it's 6000 years old. One of these is not correct. || I can go from blokey to girlie in 15 minutes and then I'm out the door. But that's the fastest I can do it. Becoming a woman takes work. || When I first came out, I thought, I want to walk like a real woman, I don't want to do mincing steps. And there was some girl I saw walking up Holloway Road in Islington who had this long languid walk and I thought, that's what I like, so I incorporated her walk into mine. || Poetry is very similar to music, only less notes and more words. || Look, it's 5 in the morning, it's just a paragraph, it will not print out, there's something, some bastard! Oh oh, there's an on-switch on the printer? || I know one or two people have heckled, but I will kill you! || What was the first cat that talked a human into putting a cat door in? || Puberty is the sickest joke God plays on us. So you're just noticing members of the sex: ""Girls girls, ooo"". Naturally you want to look your best, and God says ""No! You will look the worst you've ever looked in your life!"" || And I think that if God did exist, he had many children. I think Jesus proves this. Jesus must be the seventh son of God. A-sus, B-sus, C-sus, D-sus, E-sus, F-sus, G-sus. That's just logic. That's just mathematical. And T-sus would always be fucking about. And P-sus does deliveries. C-sus started the Roman Empire. Cae-sus. F-sus, City in Turkey. B-sus was covered in something. Some people applauding there; other people going, ""What?"" ... B-sus was covered in bees. || But then the Roman Empire fell like this- ""oh shit"". And we went into what the historians called the Stupid Fucker period. Where everyone was going -""er, I dunno. Is that a Roman road? Can we eat it?"" Then there was the dark Ages. "" I can't even see you! Where are you?"" || Never put a sock in a toaster. || We have toasters in this country... and they lie to us! Because it has numbers from one to six and it lies to us! || If you're choking in a restaurant you can just say the magic words, ""Heimlich maneuver,"" and all will be well. Trouble is, it's difficult to say ""Heimlich maneuver"" when you're choking to death. || We will now sing forth, hymn 405, 'Oh God, what on earth is my hairdo all about?' || Whats that star? It's the Death Star. What does it do? It does Death! It does Death buddy! Get out of my way. || You piss me off you Salmon... You're too expensive in restaurants. || But then the Roman Empire fell like this- ""oh shit"". And we went into what the historians called the Stupid Fucker period. Where everyone was going - ""er, I dunno. Is that a Roman road? Can we eat it?"" Then there was the dark Ages. ""I can't even see you! Where are you?"" || I saw something in a program on something in Miami, and they were saying, ""We've redecorated this building to how it looked over 50 years ago!"" And people were going, ""No, surely not, no. No one was alive then!"" || And there’s others like taxidermist! You can’t just go, “Oh, I was just working at the chip shop, and I just started stuffing animals with sand,” you know? You’ve gotta want to be! “I want to be a taxidermist! I wanna fill animals with sand. I wanna get more sand into an animal than anybody has ever bloody got in one. I wanna fill a rat with the entire Gobi Desert, so it’s really quite tight.” || This is a 14th century Ming... thing. Made out of Ming by Mr. Ming during the Ming Period. If you don't like Ming, don't touch this one. || We love Shaggy and Scooby because they were cowards! Because we can identify with them. We love them! The other guys driving the van? Fuck off! || Fox hunting, there's big fox hunting thing, there’s arguments in Britain about fox hunting. And they go around. They obviously hunt foxes because the foxes, they attack chickens. And posh people have an alliance with chickens just like in the First World War. || Horseshoes are lucky. Horses have four bits of lucky nailed to their feet. They should be the luckiest animals in the world. They should rule the country. They should win all their horse races, at least. ""In the fifth race today, every single horse was first equal...one horse threw a shoe came in third...the duck was ninth...and five ran."" || I've done a bit of Latin in my time... but I can control it.  || If you've never seen an elephant ski, you've never been on acid. || A problem of type 2094 has occurred... what the fuck is that... what does that mean... what are the 2093 problems I skipped to get to this one? || I definitely have breast envy. When teenage girls were saying 'I wish I had breasts', I was thinking the same thing. || Charelton Heston and a monkey with a gun... Film at 11. || You notice how they always put the fruit and veg at the entrance to the supermarket? You go in thinking 'this is a fresh shop, everything in here is fresh! I will do well to shop here'. You never go straight to the bit with the toilet paper, loo brushes and such do you? You'd think 'this is a poo shop! Everything in here is themed on poo! || They say that 'Guns don't kill people, people kill people.' Well I think the gun helps. If you just stood there and yelled BANG, I don't think you'd kill too many people. || If there was a God, don't you think he would have flicked Hitler's head off? || Remove your pajamas from your body. Tie knots in the arms and the legs and the head and the everything. And then whip them over your head very fast and then inflate them to the size and consistency of a small speed boat. || I am a professional transvestite, so I can run about in heels and not fall over. Cause if a woman falls over wearing heels, that’s embarrassing. But if a bloke falls over wearing heels, you have to kill yourself. It’s the end of your life. || How to survive boarding school. Do not express emotion, do not feel emotion, do not have emotion. If someone hits you, hit them back, if someone argues with you, argue back, never give in an inch, never look vulnerable and you will survive. || They're not very good at naming Popes as well. They had a run of Piuses, it went like Hollywood, they had Pope Pius the first, the second, Pope Pius the third ""The revenge of Pope Pius"". Pope Pius the fourth, ""This time he's pissed off."" Pope Pius the fifth in 3D! || I can't get the fuckin' trees, damn I will kill everyone in the world! || Other animals could have secret talents, like tigers might be good with banjos. || During the second world war Pope Pius the 12th was supposed to apologise not apologise, he was supposed to castigate Hitler for being a genocidal fuck-head with bunny rabbit ears. Um, but he didn't say that; he wimped out, and he's been renamed now, as Pope Gutless Barstard the first. || At school, the first page I ever learnt in French was full of things that are quite difficult to get into conversation, thinks like ""The mouse is underneath the table"" – ""La souris est en dessous la table"". Just slip that when you’re buying a ticket to Paris: ""Le train à Paris, oui? C’est ici? C’est maintenant? Cinq minutes… la souris est en dessous la table…"" || So in the Christian faith God created Adam in his own image, yeah? So that was good, but 65 million years before that God created the dinosaurs using the image of his cousin Ted. And Ted was not the black sheep of the family, he was the huge fucking monster of the family. || Twang him into a tree! || I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from. || Two languages in one brain? No one can live at that speed! || I'm covered in bees! || When a bird gets sucked into an engine they call it ""bird strike"". It's not bird strike, it's ""engine suck""! || There’s a huge hole in the whole Flood drama, because anything that could float or swim got away scot-free, and it was the idea to wipe out everything, He didn’t say, “I will kill everything, except the floating ones and the swimming ones, who will get out due to a loophole.” || Most transvestites fancy girls. || You have the American dream! The American dream is to be born in the gutter and have nothing. Then to raise up and have all the money in the world, and stick it in your ears and go PLBTLBTLBLTLBTLBLT!! That's a pretty good dream. || She said, ""Spell 'ant' "", and I wrote out the entire alphabet. She said, ""That doesn't spell 'ant' "", and I said, ""It's in there somewhere! There's the A, there's the N, there's the T – the rest are silent!"" || And in the back, behind there, not giving a damn … and all the bright colours and stuff just drops off when you get to this section. White wrap-up, big red letters; LARD! Eat this shit and die! LARD! Kills you stone dead! Does blood move through your arteries? Block it up with LARD! Nutritional advice? No! Proteins? What the hell are they? Carbohydrates? Never heard of them, Guv! Fat? You bet your bum! We've got some some of that, yes sirree Bob! Oh, we're full of that, mate … Remember that campaign for butter, ""Welcome back to butter""? ""Welcome back to LARD!"" We never went nowhere! Just been sitting at the back, quietly waiting … like Jack Nicholson … || You know, if a woman falls over wearing heels, that's embarrassing, but if a bloke falls over wearing heels, then you have to kill yourself. It's the end of your life. Its quite difficult. || I am an evil Giraffe. || Your eyes flashed fire into my soul. I immediately read the words of Dostoyevsky and Karl Marx, and in the words of Albert Schweitzer, I fancy you! || Because that's what narcissism is all about; looking in the mirror everyday and thinking 'Damn, I'd like to shag myself.' || This is football we're talking about here, which you call bananas and you're reluctant to play it. But you play baseball, the World Series. You've won every year, America's won every year in that. Well done America. || San Francisco! City of dreaming spires, people live here... Golden Gate Bridge, ahh the Romans came here. || Did I leave the gas on? No! No, I'm a fuckin' squirrel! || Cable cars are fun - everyone gets on board and becomes a rhesus monkey. || The Pope is guarded by the Swiss guard who stand proudly in pajamas and silly hats. || But with dogs, we do have ""bad dog."" Bad dog exists. ""Bad dog! Bad dog! Stole a biscuit, bad dog!"" The dog is saying, ""Who are you to judge me? You human beings who’ve had genocide, war against people of different creeds, colors, religions, and I stole a biscuit?! Is that a crime? People of the world!"" ""Well, if you put it that way, I think you’ve got a point. Have another biscuit, sorry.” || We stole countries with the cunning use of flags. Just sail around the world and stick a flag in. ""I claim India for Britain!"" They're going ""You can't claim us, we live here! Five hundred million of us!"" ""Do you have a flag …? ""No..."" ""Well, if you don't have a flag, then you can't have a country. Those are the rules... that I just made up!"" || If I were Achilles I would put my foot in a fuck off block of concrete! || Cause Jesus I do think did exist, and he was, I think, a guy who had interesting ideas in the Gandhi-type area, in the Nelson Mandela-type area, you know, relaxed and groovy; and the Romans thought, ""Relaxed and groovy?! No, no, no, no, no!"" So they murdered him. And kids eat chocolate eggs, because of the color of the chocolate, and the color of the... wood on the cross. Well, you tell me! It's got nothing to do with it, has it? || Britain should be in the driving seat of Europe. In the driver's seat, or in the passenger seat. That's good, cuz then you can take a sleep. || But puberty was… well, before puberty, at school, I didn't tell kids I was a transvestite ‘cause I thought they might kill me with sticks, you know? || As long as they're homophobic behind closed doors, and don't hurt anyone, I'm fine with it. || Cake or death? || The Spanish Inquisition wouldn’t have worked with Church of England. “Talk! Will you talk!” “But it hurts!” “Well, loosen it up a bit, will you? Fine…” || Catholicism still has the fire and brimstone ""boom boom boom boom 'Row you bastards!'"" || I am two lesbians in a man's body. || What have you been reading, The Gospel according to St. Bastard?! || Pope Pius XII was meant to go and castigate Hitler for being a ""Genocidal Fuckhead … with bunny rabbit ears"". But he didn't, he wimped out, and for that history has renamed that Pope as ""Pope Gutless Bastard I."" || Religion and philosophy, philosophy and religion - they're two words which are both... different. In spelling. || There's two positions in snowboarding. One is looking cool and the other is dead! || Pears can just fuck off too. 'Cause they're gorgeous little beasts, but they're ripe for half an hour, and you're never there. They're like a rock or they're mush. In the supermarket, people banging in nails. ""I'll just put these shelves up, mate, then you can have the pear."" … So you think, ""I'll take them home and they'll ripen up."" But you put them in the bowl at home, and they sit there, going, ""No! No! Don't ripen yet, don't ripen yet. Wait til he goes out the room! Ripen! Now now now!” || The right-wing papers in Britain, they loved it because they could sell all the newspapers. ""You frenchy, froggy, froggy, frenchy. Our lovely beefy. You frenchy, froggy, frenchy"". This was a Times editorial piece. || MAC gave me 55 lipsticks to test. These are the same lipsticks I got caught stealing by the police when I was 15. How ironic. || D'you remember that famous fight, George Formby against Muhammad Ali? Ah, it was brilliant. Dyslexic promoter put it on. || I'm a one-man idiot. || Scrabble was invented by Nazis to piss off kids with dyslexia. || If you go down as a comedian's comedian, that's basically meaning other comedians are hopefully feeling that you're doing okay. || I don't have techno-fear, I have techno-joy! I love technology! I love to get a new machine. Every time I get a new machine, I think, ""This is the one! I won't have to work again; I've got this thing!"" And if you have techno-joy, you get the instructions, you unwrap it, and you throw the instructions out the window! Forget them! Fuck 'em! On. I must know how this works, I've used machines before! || Performance enhancing drugs are banned in the Olympics. Ok, we can swing with that. But performance debilitating drugs should not be banned. Smoke a joint and win the hundred meters, fair play for you. That's pretty damn good. Unless someone's dangling a Mars bar off in the distance. || There's something weird, something phenomenally dreary about Christian singing. The Gospel singers are the only singers that just go crazy, joyous and it's fucking amazing! And it's born out of kidnapping, imprisonment, slavery, murder, all of that - and this joyous singing! || Racist people, interestingly, are never as polite as smokers. Have you noticed that? Smokers always go, ""Do you mind if I smoke? Oh, you do? Okay, I'll go outside and have a cigarette."" Racist people never go, ""Do you mind if I'm racist? Oh, I'll go outside … fucking blue people, eh? Coming here, steal our hamsters…"" || And the druids, they were into sex and death in an interesting night-time telly sort of way. || You can't land on the moon and say, ""Ooh, it's all sticky! It's covered in jam!” || What shall we call our son so he does not get the shit kicked out of him at school? We shall call him Englebert Humperdink! Yes, that'll work. || Thank you for flying Church of England, cake or death? || I appreciate your applause, but I don't do it for applause. I do it for cash, it's much better. || So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many, many years, and then President Clinton lied about a relationship, and everyone was surprised! A little naive, I feel! || It all bottomed out with the Renaissance Period. Ren-ais-sance. That’s Renaissance, French for ‘re-birth’. Re-nais-sance. And that’s why most of the Renaissance happened slap bang in the middle of Fr…Italy."
Eddie Murphy,"The white man gets all the best catchphrases! || It occurs to me that the best way you hurt rich people is you turn them into poor people. || I've been in prison for three years. My dick gets hard if the wind blows. || You're gonna be the nine-toed-havingest-limpingest bitch in Harlem if you don't stop fucking with me. || This is how you answer a door in my neighborhood. WHO IS IT? || Over the past 50 years Bob Hope employed 88 joke writers who supplied him with more than one million gags, and he still couldn't make me laugh. || Mick Jagger's lips' so big, black people be going, ""You got some big-ass lips!"" || I don’t think more concentration is required for Robert De Niro to do what he does as for Jim Carrey to do what he does. || The economy in Ireland has been rampaging ahead for the last 15 years. Barring an international, political or natural catastrophe, things can only get better for the Irish. || It’s important to spend time with them... I want my grandchildren to be brought up the same way I raised my children. || My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time... || The welfare of our children is our main concern and their best interests are our first priority. || Once you've had a man with no legs, you never go back baby. || All right, bitch, you want to fight? We can fight then, you fat motherfucker, l'm tired of your shit! || This is the cleanest and nicest police car I've ever been in my life. This thing is nicer than my apartment. || I’ve made 30 movies and for the most part my movies work. In a business where success is an exception and not the rule, I’ve mostly been successful. || I tell ya, I'm bout as crazy as a dog in a hubcap factory. || Is it just me, or does every woman in New York have a severe emotional problem? || Anything you have to acquire a taste for was not meant to be eaten. || It sure is a beautiful day. Know why? My wife walked out on me. Isn't that nice? I'm so glad the bitch is gone. || White people can't dance. I'm not being racist it's true. Just like when white people say black people have big lips, it's not racist it's true. Black people have big lips, white people can't dance. Some brothers will be in the club and white people are like, What are those niggers doing in here? They watchin' y'all dance. And thy're like, Look at these crazy muthafuckas. Y'all be stepping on people's feet and hitting one another. || My mother ran in the bathroom, see my big brother sitting in the bathroom with a piece of shit in his hand in the tub, I was laying in the bottom of the water with blood gushing out my eye, G.I. Joe up my ass. My mother's like, ""What the fuck going on in here?"" || I think in twenty years I’ll be looked at like Bob Hope. Doing those president jokes and golf shit. It scares me. || I would do a scene with a little kid and they’d turn to me afterwards and say, ""I love you Eddie Murphy"". That’s a new thing for me, to have a co-star in a scene turn to me and tell me they love me. In ""48 Hours"" Nick Nolte never turned to me and said ""I love you Ed”. || I never had inspirations to be in this movie business. I was always a stand up comedian, that’s what I am more than anything. || I’d like to produce, direct, write, score, and star in a film in exactly the way Chaplin did. I’ll do that before I’m thirty. || In the original script, my character was a basketball player rather than a boxer. I didn’t think I could pull that off. I’m a little short to be a basketball player! || The advice I would give to someone is to not take anyone's advice. || I’m sadistic. I go to the supermarket to watch mothers lose it and beat the shit out of their kids. || I ain't never been in no cell that had a phone in it. Can I stay for a while? I ordered some pizza. || Now, a brother's dick is too big, so it'll fuck up his balance... Every time you see a brother in a wheelchair, he ain't always crippled. || Hey, what about Shrek? He's ugly 24/7! || Sir, where can one go to find nice women here? || I’m in a whole different part of show business. I’m not even part of Shakespeare in Love. || Oh, get the fuck outta here! Just 'cause I'm a convict, every thin' that comes outta my mouth is a god damn lie? || I'm not playing with you. I will blow that black, crusty, dead knarled motherfucker the fuck off your foot! Now put the razor away! || The thing about kids is that they express emotion. They don’t hold back. If they want to cry, they cry, and if they are in a good mood, they’re in a good mood. || Any boob can run a day-care centre but it takes a family to raise some kids and that's what we're going to be from now on, a family. || There's something about the ice cream truck that makes kids lose it. And they can hear that shit from ten blocks away. They don't hear their mothers calling but they can hear that motherfucking ice cream truck. || Now I can't have no 'curse' show - I mean - I got to throw in a few jokes in between the curses! I can't come out and just go ""Hello! Filth flar'n filth, motherfucker, dick, pussy, snot, and shit. Good night! Suck my dick! || I am a man who has never tied his own shoes before! || Okay, I got no car, I got no money, and I'm gonna end the day off with this goddamn dope man's Uzi by my temple! Thank you, Jack! Look, this is Jack's day, why don't you just let Jack shoot me? Save your bullet! Jack, why don't you shoot me? Shoot me, Jack! || Does anyone have a mother that would hit you with a shoe? I had a mother that would throw a shoe at you at the drop of a dime. And fuck you up wherever she was aiming. So by the time I was like ten, my mother was like Clint Eastwood with a shoe. || I’ve always had confidence. It came because I have lots of initiative. I wanted to make something of myself. || Right now we’ve got to stretch that dollar as far as we can. || Flowers are the fastest way to a woman's heart. Well, actually, the fastest way is through her rib cage, but flowers are a lot less messy. || I started out as an impressionist and that`s all about observing - how people move, their voice quality, their attitudes and quirks. || That's my idol, Elvis Presley. If you went to my house, you`d see pictures all over of Elvis. He's just the greatest entertainer that ever lived. And I think it's because he had such presence. When Elvis walked into a room, Elvis Presley was in the fucking room. I don't give a fuck who was in the room with him, Bogart, Marilyn Monroe. || How can you do the moonwalk and ask a woman to dance? ""Hey baby lets dance... cya later!"" || If I don’t die in a plane crash or something, this country has a rare opportunity to watch a great talent grow. || I trip off it. You know what's interesting about the makeup is when you get up close and you know he's been working on your face and you see where the makeup starts and it stops and how seamless it is. You could look at it for hours. || Listen, I know what I like, and I know you know what I like, because you were trained to know what I like, but I would like to know, what do you like? || In reality, all men are sculptors, constantly chipping away the unwanted parts of their lives trying to create a masterpiece. || I been seeing newspapers every Sunday morning, white dudes be in there in their drawers, never having no bulge in they drawers. Smiling at you. If I ain't have no bulge, I wouldn't be smiling! || Bear and a rabbit were taking a shit in the woods. And the bear turns to the rabbit and says, ""Excuse me, do you have problems with shit sticking to your fur?"" And the rabbit says, ""No."" So the bear wiped his ass with the rabbit. || You know, making a movie is a collaborative effort and sometimes all the ingredients don’t work out. I know that every now and again I am going to make a movie that won’t work. || I’m 42 and the age of a guy who has kids, so I guess I’m playing right where I’m supposed to be. I’m comfortable with that, but in the same breath I’d do something edgy. If someone came to me and offered me an edgy and funny story, then I’d do it. || I want a woman that's going to arouse my intellect as well as my lions. || There was a lot of stuff where we were doing scenes and we would bust out laughing - more on this movie than ever, where you can't finish scenes. I hope we didn't mess up the movie. || It's your aptitude, not just your attitude that determines your ultimate altitude. || You know you can't just run and shoot people in the knee-caps with double barreled shotgun 'cause you're pissed at them. || We need to be prepared to help with their rent and utilities for six months to a year. We don't want them working right now. || We want the same effect as if someone's house burned here. We want to give them a normal life as soon as possible. || I don't think more concentration is required for Robert De Niro to do what he does as for Jim Carrey to do what he does. || If you`re involved in with something that`s original, you know, you`ll always go back and try to rehash it. || White boys always get the Oscar. It's a known fact. Did I ever get a nomination? No! You know why? Cause I hadn't played any of them slave roles, and get my ass whipped. That's how you get the nomination. A black dude who plays a slave that gets his ass whipped gets the nomination, a white guy who plays an idiot gets the Oscar. That's what I need, I need to play a retarded slave, then I'll get the Oscar. || Have a little fun. || The competitions are as much a part of the tradition as the actual dances. || Oh, shit... somebody fucked you up real bad. I'll tell you what... I'm gonna go now, cuz I think you want to sit there, by yourself, and think about who you pissed off. Excuse me. || There's a song out now called Ain't Nothing Going On But The Rent. So when a man asks a woman Hey, baby! What's going on? The woman will say, The rent, motherfucker!  || Apparently every man was told to bring three women with them. Sounds like a ho-down. || My life is nothing like the Daddy Day Care life. Me around the house is nothing like the Daddy Day Care dad. || I’m relaxed about my career. I’ve been making movies for over 20 years, so I’ve earned at least the right to relax. || Disturbing the peace? I got thrown out of a window! What's the fuckin charge for getting pushed out of a moving car, huh? Jaywalking?! || I keep telling people I’ll make movies until I’m fifty and then I’ll go and do something else. I’m going to be a professional gentleman of leisure. || Jacuzzi? See, I knew y'all was faggots! || I wish people would stop making fun of fat people... they have enough shit on their plates. || Alright, listen up! I don't like white people. I hate rednecks. You people are rednecks. That means I'm enjoyin' this shit. || The only reason I did ""Showtime"" was Robert De Niro. I definitely consider him to be in the top 5 all time actors. || Every bad decision I’ve ever made has been based on money. I grew up in the projects and you don’t turn down money there. You take it, because you never know when it’s all going to end. I made Cop III because they offered me $15 million. That $15 million was worth having Roger Ebert’s thumb up my ass. || In a movie like this, the relationship between the two guys is crucial. It sinks or swims on how these two guys are together. I think we did a good job."
Ellen DeGeneres,"To be honest, I'd be the last person who should be doling out gardeinng advice. I don't have the patience for growing things. Yes, I realize there's nothing quite as satisfying as eating food that you've pulled up from the ground and that's why, at the height of the planting season, I bury cans of tomato soup in my backyard and dig them up in late spring. || My life is perfect even when it's not. || It's failure that gives you the proper perspective on success. || If you want to test cosmetics, why do it on some poor animal who hasn't done anything? They should use prisoners who have been convicted of murder or rape instead. So, rather than seeing if perfume irritates a bunny rabbit's eyes, they should throw it in Charles Manson's eyes and ask him if it hurts. || I wonder what will happen if i put a hand cream on my feet, will they get confused and start clapping? || Who's to say what's better or worse anyway? Who's to even say what's normal or average? We're all different people and we're allowed to be different from on another. If someone ever says you're weird, say thank you. And then curtsy. No, don't curtsy. That might be too weird. Bow. And tip your imaginary hate. That'll show them. || All the commercials on TV today are for antidepressants, for Prozac or Paxil. And they get you right away. ""Are you sad? Do you get stressed, do you have anxiety?"" ""Yes, I have all those things! I'm alive!"" || I really don't think I need buns of steel. I'd be happy with buns of cinnamon. || If we don’t want to define ourselves by things as superficial as our appearances, we’re stuck with the revolting alternative of being judged by our actions. || The only thing I really recommend, if you're starting out in stand-up is to not try to copy anybody else. You can be influenced by people. I was influenced by Steve Martin and Bob Newhart and Woody Allen, but I never tried to be someone else. I always tried to be myself. And the reason people are successful is they're unique. || I don't need a baby growing inside me for nine months. If I'm going to feel nauseous and achy when I wake up, I want to achieve that state the old-fashioned way: getting good and drunk the night before. || Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work and driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for - in order to get to the job you need to pay for the clothes and the car, and the house you leave vacant all day so you can afford to live in it. || Laugh. Laugh as much as you can. Laugh until you cry. Cry until you laugh. Keep doing it even if people are passing you on the street saying, ""I can't tell if that person is laughing or crying, but either way they seem crazy, let's walk faster."" Emote. It's okay. It shows you are thinking and feeling. || Leaning forward in your chair when someone is trying to squeeze behind you isn't enough. You also have to move the chair. || True beauty is not related to what color your hair is or what color your eyes are. True beauty is about who you are as a human being, your principles, your moral compass. || Start thinking positively. You will notice a difference. Instead of 'I think I'm a loser,' try 'I definitely am a loser.' Stop being wishy-washy about things! How much more of a loser can you be if you don't even know you are one? Either you are a loser or you are not. Which is it, stupid? || Do things that make you happy within the confines of the legal system. || The thing everyone should realize is that the key to happiness is being happy for yourself and yourself. || I'd like to be more patient! I just want everything now. I've tried to meditate, but it's really hard for me to stay still. I'd like to try to force myself to do it, because everybody says how wonderful meditation is for you, but I can't shut my mind up. So patience and learning is the key. || I hope I make people feel better. I hope I take people out of their situations a little bit and make them happier. That's really why I do what I do. || Above all things physical, it is more important to be beautiful on the inside - to have a big hear and an open mind and a spectacular spleen. || My dog of 17 years just died. Oh you're kidding?.. No... as funny as that is, I'm not. || Why is it that when you wipe up dust its called dusting but when you wipe up a spill its not called spilling? Just something to think about. || Things will get easier, people's minds will change, and you should be alive to see it. || I gotta work out. I keep saying it all the time. I keep saying I gotta start working out. It's been about two months since I've worked out. And I just don't have the time. Which uh... is odd. Because I have the time to go out to dinner. And uh... and watch tv. And get a bone density test. And uh... try to figure out what my phone number spells in words. || The good psychic would pick up the phone before it rang. Of course it is possible there was noone on the other line. Once she said ""God Bless you"" I said, ""I didn't sneeze"" She looked deep into my eyes and said, ""You will, eventually."" And damn it if she wasn't right. Two days later I sneezed. || I have the worst memory ever so no matter who comes up to me - they're just, like, 'I can't believe you don't remember me!' I'm like, 'Oh Dad I'm sorry!' || Don't give advice. It will come back and bite you in the butt. Don't take anyone's advice. So, my advice to you is to be true to yourself and everything will be fine. || Friends will write me letters. They run out of room on the front of the letter. They write 'over' on the bottom of the letter. Like I'm that much of a moron. Like I need that there. Because if it wasn't there, I'd get to the bottom of the page: 'And so Kathy and I went shopping and we' That's the craziest thing! I don't know why she would just end it that way. || I see those picketers, and I think you know, if I weren't a loving, non-violent, spiritual person, I would really go over there and grab those signs and smash them over their heads and shove them up their asses. But... I'm a loving, spiritual person. || I'm feeling so good. I feel like a million bucks. I'm focused, I'm alert, I'm zippy and top of my game. I've never felt better! I'm sharp as a tack right now. And what's weird is that I didn't get a good nights sleep last night. And they say that's the most important thing. Or is it breakfast they said? That's the most important meal of the day, breakfast... yes. And then it's 'i' before 'e' I know that. Um... diamonds are a girl's best friend. Dog is a man's best friend.. What was I talking about? Oh, that's right, that I feel great and I'm at the top of my game. And it's odd because I didn't get hardly any sleep last night. And, they say that's the most important thing. || The sixties were when hallucinogenic drugs were really, really big. And I don't think it's a coincidence that we had the type of shows we had then, like The Flying Nun. || You know me. Any excuse to put on a dress. || I get paid very well for an amazing, amazing life. I'm blessed. || I think the hard thing about stand-up - I mean, I think this part is great - but that the traveling is y'know, 'cause - 'cause I'm gone a lot from home and this time I'm out for three-and-a-half weeks without going home, and that's hard, to be gone three-and-a-half weeks 'cause then I have to ask my friends, ""Would you mind going to the house and watering the plants, and turn some lights on and make it look like somebody's home, and make sure that the mobile over the crib isn't tangled or the baby's gonna get bored...""  || I'm a lesbian, an Aquarian, and a vegetarian. || That woman in the shampoo commercial - she's happy. She's... she's too happy. || I think people talk too much anyway. Sometimes people are talking to me and in my mind I'm just like ""shut up, shut up, shut up... blah blah blah blah blaaaaah."" || Really, he called me that? Ellen DeGenerate? I've been getting that since fourth grade. I guess I'm happy I could give him work. || Nothing says holidays, like a cheese log. || Life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows. The thing everyone should realize is that the key to happiness is being happy by yourself and for yourself. Happiness comes from within. You have the power to change your own mindset so that all the negative, horrible thoughts that try to invade your psyche are replaced with happy, positive, wonderful thoughts. || Procrastinate now, don't put it off. || You just have to keep driving down the road. It's going to bend and curve and you'll speed up and slow down, but the road keeps going. || I'm just saying we can all work on our manners. We can say please and thank you. We can be punctual. We can just be nicer to one another. It's something we have in our power to do. || The only way a no-legged leopard could hurt you is if it fell out of a tree onto your head. || I cannot believe they haven't yet come up with a better screening process than the mammogram. If a man had to put his special parts inside a clamp to test him for anything, I think they would come up with a new plan before the doctor finished saying, ""Put that thing there so I can crush it. || If we're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, there's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that. || My point is, life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows. The pina and the colada. || I still get scared at night. Every tiny creak, every little noise, I open my eyes real wide and listen with them. Have you noticed that? When it’s dark and you can’t see a thing, you open your eyes really wide and glance back and force, like your eyes become your ears? || Quick decision makers are often stuck behind annoying people in line at Starbucks. || When I look back on the stuff I used to wear, I wonder why somebody didn't try to stop me. Just a friendly warning, ""You may regret this,"" would have been fine. || Way back in the day, like in the 1990s, if you wanted to tell everyone you ate waffles for breakfast, you couldn’t just go on the internet and tweet it out. There was only one way to do it. You had to go outside and scream at the top of your lungs, 'I ate waffles for breakfast!' That’s why so many people ended up in institutions. They seemed crazy, but when you think about it, they were just ahead of their time. || Though you feel you're not where you're suppose to be, you shouldn't worry because that next turn that you take, it will lead you to where you wanna go. || For me, it's that I contributed, ... That I'm on this planet doing some good and making people happy. That's to me the most important thing, that my hour of television is positive and upbeat and an antidote for all the negative stuff going on in life. || Haters are my motivators. || It always helps to think about other people instead of ourselves. || I prefer to believe that people are good and honest and respect me enough to tell me the truth. It's not easy to find those people all the time, but they're out there. || You know, it's hard work to write a book. I can't tell you how many times I really get going on an idea, then my quill breaks. Or I spill ink all over my writing tunic. || I've been trying to find women writers for my staff for a while now and I have three women on my staff and three guys so it's pretty equal. I don't know why that is. It's been the same thing for a while. It's hard for female comedians to stand out. That's weird. That's a shame. || Trying to get the talk show, looking back on it, we had to beg a lot of station managers to pick up the show because people thought no one would watch it because I'm openly gay. || Then you have these people in the movie theaters that talk the whole time during the movie. You ever go with somebody like that to a movie but you don't realize until you get there that you're with somebody like that? Brand new movie. First day it's open. You're there together and the entire time they're sitting there: ""Where's she going? Why'd he do that? Is he mad at her?"" ""I don't know, let's watch and find out together shall we?"" You know who you are. You're denying it right now: ""I do not do that. Why is she saying that?. What's she gonna say next?"" || I was in yoga the other day. I was in full lotus position. My chakras were all aligned. My mind is cleared of all clatter and I'm looking out of my third eye and everything that I'm supposed to be doing. It's amazing what comes up, when you sit in that silence. 'Mama keeps whites bright like the sunlight, Mama's got the magic of Clorox 2.' || And now I've got to explain the smell that was in there before I went in there. Does that ever happen to you? It's not your fault. You've held your breath, you just wanna get out, and now you open the door and you have to explain, 'Oh! Listen, there's an odor in there and I didn't do it. It's bad.' || Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. || They say you just stand over there, he'll say thank you and you walk back off and that's what I thought was gonna happen, but in my head, I had for five or six years known that he was gonna call me over. || When I was younger I thought success was something different. I thought, ""When I grow up, I want to be famous. I want to be a star. I want to be in movies. When I grow up I want to see the world, drive nice cars. I want to have groupies."" But my idea of success is different today. For me, the most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity and not to give into peer pressure, to try to be something that you're not. To live your life as an honest and compassionate person. To contribute in some way. || You have to have funny faces and words, you can't just have words. It is a powerful thing, and I think that's why it's hard for people to imagine that women can do that, be that powerful. || Comedy can be, especially in a writer's room, really aggressive, kind of a very male-dominated room, and it would be hard for women. It's not a nurturing place. It's not like a lot of women are going to say, I can't wait to live that lifestyle and be in a writer's room until 2 or 3 a.m. || Here's the analogy. If my body were a car, I'd be thinking about trading it in around now. I would like to upgrade. I would be actually on the lot somewhere and some guy with a loud sports jacket would be sizing me up... kinda looking around going maybe kicking my knees. Looking behind me going: ""That looks a little bashed in back there...Yeah. You mind if I check under the hood?"" ""Well yes I do! Thank you very much."" || In the 80's we had high, high, waisted pants, that if they came up any higher they'd have to go up another size, if you know what I mean. || I have a terrible problem with procrastination... a friend told me, ""Well, you should go to therapy. And I thought about it, but then I said, ""Wait a minute. Why should I pay a stranger to listen to me talk when I can get strangers to pay to listen to me talk?"" And that's when I got the idea of touring. || For a long time I thought I knew for sure who I was. I grew up in New Orleans and became a comedian. And there was everything that came along with that. The nightclubs. The smoking. The drinking. Then I turned 13. || What goes up must come down, which is why I don't wear tube tops. || People love their animals so much so that they put little clothes on them and necklaces and booties and things like that. And if you love your animal, then you should feed them something that's not dangerous for them. There's a lot of poisonous stuff that they're putting in a lot of that food, those by-products. || I'm glad I'm funny. I'm glad I make people happy, because that's very important. But I'm most proud to be known as a kind person... Because kindness spreads, and the world is a little nicer out there. || But seriously, I think overall in the scheme of things winning an Emmy is not important. Let's get our priorities straight. I think we all know what's really important in life - winning an Oscar. || I've got a lot to say about television. There's a lot going on in television right now and I feel like a huge part of television. || If we lose our phones, we lose our phone books. You don't memorize numbers anymore. || I look at anything in nature and how things work-the stars, the pyramids-and I can't imagine that there's not some kind of design to it all. There's got to be something big that we don't understand. I do believe in Jesus. I believe in being good to one another. Life is about spending our time here contributing and not taking away. That's my faith. || Some of the most devastating things that happen to you will teach you the most. || Haiku sounds like I'm saying hi to someone named Ku. Hi, Ku. Hello. || Even before I knew I was gay, I knew I didn't want to have a child. I knew I didn't want to have one. I never want to have to release it from me. Listen, I love babies. I love children. And I melt when I'm around them. I also love my freedom and I love that I can sleep at night. || I am saddened by how people treat one another and how we are so shut off from one another and how we judge one another, when the truth is, we are all one connected thing. We are all from the same exact molecules. || I work really hard at trying to see the big picture and not getting stuck in ego. I believe we're all put on this planet for a purpose, and we all have a different purpose... When you connect with that love and that compassion, that's when everything unfolds. || So many people prefer to live in drama because it's comfortable. It's like someone staying in a bad marriage or relationship - it's actually easier to stay because they know what to expect every day, versus leaving and not knowing what to expect. || In the beginning there was nothing. God said, 'Let there be light!' And there was light. There was still nothing, but you could see it a whole lot better. || I ask people why they have deer heads on their walls. They always say because it's such a beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother is attractive, but I have photographs of her. || Who needs sleep? I laugh in the face of sleep! || The first person I learned I could make happy with laughter was my mother, whom I idolize. It was a powerful thing to realize. I knew I had found my life's work. || It's our challenges and obstacles that give us layers of depth and make us interesting. Are they fun when they happen? No. But they are what make us unique. And that's what I know for sure... I think. || I don't want to take a pill. Go to Africa, go follow some bushman around. He's being chased by a lion. That's stress. You're not going to find a pygmy on Paxil, I'll tell you that right now. || Sometimes the greatest things are the most embarrassing. || I had a really tough time for a few years. My show was gone. My phone wasn't ringing. There wasn't one job offer. And at that point, I thought I knew for sure that I wouldn't work in Hollywood again. || Actually, there's nothing I know for sure because I know for sure that things change. || The first time probably people really were aware of me, I unfortunately had the title of Showtime's Funniest Person in America. And that's a really tough title to travel around with when you're not even known. || Right before I decided to come out, I went on a spiritual retreat called 'Changing the Inner Dialogue of Your Subconscious Mind.' I'd never been to anything like it before, and all my friends were taking bets on how long I'd last with no TV, no radio, no phone. But for me that was the beginning of paying attention to all the little things. || If you want to get rid of stuff, you can always do a good spring-cleaning. Or you can do what I do. Move. || I've moved about 10 times over the past 15 years. I don't move for the sole purpose of getting rid of stuff. I'm not crazy. I also move so that I never have to wash any windows. || Don't you hate when people are late to work. And they always have the worst excuses. ""Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, traffic."" ""Traffic, huh? How do you think I got here; helicoptered in!?"" || I would love to have the same rights as everybody else. I would love, I don't care if it's called marriage. I don't care if it's called, you know, domestic partnership. I don't care what it's called. || I think anybody who wants to be president has to be a politician, but I would like to find somebody who's coming from a loving place instead of a political place. || I just feel like every kid is growing up too fast and they're seeing too much. Everything is about sex, and that's fine for me. I'm not saying I don't like it. But I don't think it should be everywhere, where kids are exposed to everything sexual. Because they have to have some innocence; there's just no innocence left. || I don't pay attention to the number of birthdays. It's weird when I say I'm 53. It just is crazy that I'm 53. I think I'm very immature. I feel like a kid. That's why my back goes out all the time, because I completely forget I can't do certain things anymore - like doing the plank for 10 minutes. || I do like men and I had, you know, a guy in high school that I wanted to marry desperately. He's the mayor of some small town in Texas. I could be the mayor's wife right now. || I became vegan because I saw footage of what really goes on in the slaughterhouses and on the dairy farms. || Contribute to the world. Help people. Help one person. Help someone cross the street today. Help someone with directions unless you have a terrible sense of direction. Help someone who is trying to help you. Just help. Make an impact. Show someone you care. Say yes instead of no. Say something nice. Smile. Make eye contact. Hug. Kiss. Get naked. || I think there's too much mult-tasking going on. I think people need to quiet down and focus and be still more. || I personally like being unique. I like being my own person with my own style and my own opinions and my own toothbrush. || Do you feel insecure because you keep getting the nagging feeling that you're not that smart? Well, I've got good news for you, my friend. You have no need to be insecure. That nagging feeling is absolutely right on target. You are not that smart. But I have more good news for you. You are also not alone. || Be kind to one another. || I don't understand the sizes anymore. There's a size zero, which I didn't even know that they had. It must stand for: 'Ohhh my God, you're thin.' || I put a basketball in front of George Clooney's door and sprayed it with supermodel perfume to lure him out. || Human beings only use ten percent of their brains. Ten percent! Can you imagine how much we could accomplish if we used the other sixty percent? || I was doing stand-up at a restaurant and there was a chalkboard on the street out front. It said, ''Soup of the Day: Cream of Asparagus. Ellen DeGeneres."" || Life is like one big Mardi Gras. But instead of showing your boobs, show people your brain, and if they like what they'll, you'll have more beads than you know what to do with. || Now, I'm no scientist, but I know what endorphins are. They're tiny little magical elves that swim through your blood stream and tell funny jokes to each other. When they reach your brain,you hear what they're saying and that boosts your health and happiness. ""Knock Knock... Who's There?.. Little endorphin... Little endorphin who?... Little Endorphin Annie."" And then the endorphins laugh and then you laugh. See? It's Science. || The problem with labels is that they lead to stereotypes and stereotypes lead to generalizations and generalizations lead to assumptions and assumptions lead back to stereotypes. It’s a vicious cycle, and after you go around and around a bunch of times you end up believing that all vegans only eat cabbage and all gay people love musicals. || While I was doing stand-up, I thought I knew for sure that success meant getting everyone to like me. So I became whoever I thought people wanted me to be. I'd say yes when I wanted to say no, and I even wore a few dresses. || When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important. || Take a nap in a fireplace and you'll sleep like a log. || Accept who you are. Unless you're a serial killer. || I get bored easily, so I need to do a lot. I've started a record label, so I get to nurture new talent and talk about music, which is a passion of mine. I've written another book. And I get to come to work and do the TV show, which is always really fun. || Find out who you are and be that person. That's what your soul was put on this Earth to be. Find that truth, live that truth and everything else will come. || Sometimes you can't see yourself clearly until you see yourself through the eyes of others. || Just go up to somebody on the street and say ""You're it!"" and then run away. || Find out who you are and figure out what you believe in. Even if it's different from what your neighbors believe in and different from what your parents believe in. Stay true to yourself. Have your own opinion. Don't worry about what people say about you or think about you. Let the naysayers nay. They will eventually grow tired of naying. || I don't want to get the same looks I give people when they get on a plane holding a baby: ""That's a cute baby, just keep walking, keep walking, keep going, keep going...."" || Emote. It's okay. It shows you are thinking and feeling. || You're not going to find a Pygmie on Paxal, I'll tell you that. || And we certainly don't have full conversations on cellphones. You know? Usually the reception is so bad, but it's only bad on your side. The person talking to you has no clue. They're just rambling on and on. You've got your finger jammed in your ear, you're shushing people on the streets. You're ducked behind a dumpster so you can hear about your friend's new hair cut. ""What about the bangs are they shorter?! Are the bangs shorter?! The bangs!"" || So, I bought a new CD and I was trying to get it open but couldn't with all the layers... I mean plastic and then tape and the tape is like government tape. It says open here... is that sarcasm?, and buy batteries and they are in there with layers and layers of cardboard and then scissors... you need scissors to get into scissors, what if you were buying them for the first time? you wouldn't be able to get them open. Then you try and buy a light bulb and it's this thin thin cardboard... what are they thinking? ""Oh, they'll be fine."" || Procrastination is not the problem. It is the solution. It is the universe's way of saying stop, slow down, you move too fast. Listen to the music. Whoa whoa, listen to the music. Because music makes the people come together, it makes the bourgeois and the rebel. So come on people now, smile on your brother, everybody try to love one another. Because what the world needs now is love, sweet love. And I know that love is a battlefield, but boogie on reggae woman because you're gonna make it after all. So celebrate good times, come on. I've gotta stop I've gotta come to my senses, I've been out riding fences for so long... oops I did it again... um... What I'm trying to say is, if you leave tonight and you don't remember anything else that I've said, leave here and remember this: Procrastinate now, don't put it off. || Oh she tripped? No, she's running. I thought she tripped but she's running. She stopped running, she did trip. You tripped! || I still have the shirt I wore my first time on Johnny Carson's show. Only now I use it as a tablecloth at dinner parties. It was very blousy. || When life gives you lemons... they could really be oranges. || I didn't go to college at all, any college, and I'm not saying you wasted your time or money, but look at me, I'm a huge celebrity. || I feel sorry for the newscasters you know? We can turn it off. But that's their job and they have to read these stories and they're just coming up on the teleprompter they don't know what's coming up. And they have to go through these change of emotions. That.. ""There were no survivors... And next Which candybar helps ya lose weight! Still to come! Is an asteroid headed towards earth... But first where to find the cheesiest pizza in town! Also, a disturbing study finds that studies are disturbing..."" || Now we have hands-free phones, so you can focus on the thing you're really supposed to be doing ... chances are, if you need both of your hands to do something, your brain should be in on it too. || I swear if Colgate comes out with one more type of toothepaste. I just want clean teeth that's all I want. I don't want the tartar and I don't want the cavaties. And I want white teeth. How come I have to choose? And then they have the 'Colgate Total' that supposedly has everything in there. I don't believe that for one second. If it's all in the one, how come they make all the others? Who's going: ""I don't mind the tartar so much.""? || It's funny how cucumber water can taste so much better than pickle juice, even though they come from the same source. || We have two dogs, Mabel and Wolf, and three cats at home, Charlie, George and Chairman. We have two cats on our farm, Tom and Little Sister, two horses, and two mini horses, Hannah and Tricky. We also have two cows, Holy and Madonna. And those are only the animals we let sleep in our bed. || The reason I do what I do is because I was influenced by Steve Martin, by Woody Allen, by Bob Newhart, by Carol Burnett, by Lucille Ball. || My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She's ninety-seven now, and we don't know where the hell she is. || We can sit and worry about what's going to happen to us two weeks from now. I'd rather focus on the amazing things happening right in front of us. || I think they should have a Barbie with a buzz cut. || I do have ADD and in real life, I'm all over the place and can hardly focus. If we were talking for, for more than an hour or so, I'd start drifting off... I can't sit still too long. || Most comedy is based on getting a laugh at somebody else's expense. And I find that that's just a form of bullying in a major way. So I want to be an example that you can be funny and be kind, and make people laugh without hurting somebody else's feelings. || I was raised around heterosexuals, as all heterosexuals are, that's where us gay people come from... you heterosexuals. || I had everything I'd hoped for, but I wasn't being myself. So I decided to be honest about who I was. It was strange: The people who loved me for being funny suddenly didn't like me for being... me. || I get those fleeting, beautiful moments of inner peace and stillness - and then the other 23 hours and 45 minutes of the day, I'm a human trying to make it through in this world. || I was coming home from kindergarten - well they told me it was kindergarten. I found out later I had been working in a factory for ten years. It's good for a kid to know how to make gloves. || Faith is part of who I am, yes. I was raised Christian Scientist. The most important thing I saw every single week on the wall at Sunday school was the Golden Rule. || One time I actually cleaned out my closet so good I ended up on the cover of Time magazine. || I'm so unfamiliar with the gym, I call it James! || Golden eagles have an interesting way of mating, where they connect in the air while flying at eighty miles an hour and then they start dropping and they don't stop dropping until the act is completed. So it's not uncommon that they both fall all the way to the ground, hit the ground and both of them die. That's how committed they are to this. I thought to myself, 'Boy, don't we feel like wimps for stopping to answer the phone.' I don't know about you, but if I'm one of these two birds, you're getting close to the ground... I would seriously consider faking' it. || Have you ever heard somebody sing some lyrics that you've never sung before, and you realize you've never sung the right words in that song? You hear them and all of a sudden you say to yourself, 'Life in the Fast Lane?' That's what they're saying right there? You think, 'why have I been singing 'wipe in the vaseline?' how many people have heard me sing 'wipe in the vaseline?' I am an idiot. || People always ask me, 'Were you funny as a child?' Well, no, I was an accountant. || I learned compassion from being discriminated against. Everything bad that's ever happened to me has taught me compassion. || People are constantly asking Portia and me if we are going to have children. We thought about it. We love to be around children after they've been fed and bathed. But we ultimately decided that we don't want children of our own. There is far too much glass in our house. || There would be nothing to get me to run for president. I don't even understand how anyone would want that job at all. Although I would be able to play golf which I don't seem to have time now. || When we were growing up our parents somehow made it clear that being famous was good. And I mistakenly thought that if I was famous then everyone would love me. || Our attention span is shot. We've all got Attention Deficit Disorder or ADD or OCD or one of these disorders with three letters because we don't have the time or patience to pronounce the entire disorder. That should be a disorder right there, TBD - Too Busy Disorder. || You should never assume. You know what happens when you assume. You make an ass out of you and me because that's how it's spelled. || Follow your passion. Stay true to yourself. Never follow someone else's path unless you're in the woods and you're lost and you see a path. By all means, you should follow that. || Baloney is just salami with an inferiority complex. || Yeah I'm thirty-six, but on the show I'm thirty-two. Nobody wants to watch a thirty-six year old woman, so they decided to make me thirty-two. Much more appealing somehow. || You know, radio DJ's must really love to talk to theirselves. Especially when they have the graveyard shift. 'Hey this is Ellen with 89.1. It is currently three in the morning. There are few cars on the road. And it your still listening heres a little music to get you to dance... || If your Birthday is on Christmas day and you're not Jesus, you should start telling people your birthday is on June 9 or something. Just read up on the traits of a Gemini. Suddenly you're a multitasker who loves the color yellow. Because not only do you get stuck with them combo gift, you get the combo song. ""We wish you a merry Christmas - and happy birthday, Terry - we wish you a merry Christmas - happy birthday, Terry - we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Ye - Birthday, Terry!"" || There are all sorts of books offering advice on how to deal with life-threatening situations, but where's the advice on dealing with embarrassing ones? || Sometimes when I am driving I get so angry at inconsiderate drivers that I want to scream at them. But then I remember how insignificant that is, and I thank God that I have a car and my health and gas. That was phrased wrong - normally you wouldn't say, thank God I have gas. || Our egos tells us we're the only ones that have any kind of feelings. We're the only ones with a relationship. We're the only ones with family. You know, I think that if you kill a spider, there is a relationship that you're ruining. There's a conversation going on outside with the other spiders. 'Did you hear about Chris?.... Killed yeah... .Sneaker. And now Stephanie has nine hundred babies to raise all alone. Well, she's got her legs full I'll tell you that right now. Chris was so kind, wouldn't hurt a fly. It's just been tough for them lately. They just lost their web last week. Those humans think they're so smart. Let them try shooting silk out of their butt and see what they can make. || We're told to go on living our lives as usual, because to do otherwise is to let the terrorists win, and really, what would upset the Taliban more than a gay woman wearing a suit in front of a room full of Jews? || People love gossip. It's the biggest thing that keeps the entertainment industry going. || What's with this sudden choice of disorders we get right now? When I was a kid, we just had crazy people. That's it, just crazy people. || We stock up on popcorn and candy like we're crossing the Sierras, don't we? ""I'll have a couple of soft pretzels, a hot dog, Milk Duds, Snocaps. Is that the largest popcorn you've got there, that bucket? You don't have a barrel or anything like that? Do you have a donkey or a pack mule or anything? - Oh, and a Diet Coke."" || My hair is always at its best in New York. I don't know what's in the water. It could be mousse. || My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom's not, and I'm not. But I believe in God, and that there's a higher power and an intelligence that's bigger than us and that we can rely on. It's not just us, thinking we are the ones in control of everything. That idea gives me support. || We all feel like idiots at one time or another. Even if we feel we're cool 98 percent of the time, that 2-percent doofus is poised to take over our bodies without any warning. || I was raised in an atmosphere of 'everything's fine.' But as I got older, I was like, 'Well no, everything's not fine. There is stuff that's sad.' I am a really sensitive person. I think I am too sensitive sometimes. || My cat, Ethel, is an indoor cat but somehow she's sneakin' out at night. 'Cause the other morning I found a stamp on her paw... I wouldn't have noticed myself, but I just bought this new black light and she passed right under it and I said, 'Hey, what's that on you paw?' || I have just learned that penguins are monogamous for life, which doesn't really surprise me all that much because they all look exactly alike. It's not like they're going to meet a better looking penguin someday. || Hosting the Emmys is a challenge for me. I guess it's the equivalent of someone who needs to climb a mountain or jump out of a plane. It's that kind of thing, where this could go terribly wrong. And I love the feeling of when it goes right. || I just like observing people - it's something I've done ever since I was a kid, and I got really good at it. That's a big part of why I became a comedian. My audience is filled with every kind of person you can imagine, and I love that. || Designing is my hobby. If I didn't do what I do for a living - at some point when I don't do this for a living - I'll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture. || I know that every time I list something that I am, I am potentially alienating a whole group of people. Publicists and managers will encourage you not to say what political party you belong to, what you eat, what you don't eat, who you sleep with and all that stuff. || We went to lunch and were talking about procrastination and the waitress overheard us and she said, ""I have a problem with procrastination, too."" I said ""Really?... Get my sandwich."" || Life is short. If you doubt me, ask a butterfly. Their average life span is a mere five to fourteen days. || I collect old portraits. They're all just interesting pictures of people, and you just kind of wonder who they were and what they were. There's a guy - I don't know who he is, but he's wearing a suit. He's got his arms folded, and he looks like he sold insurance or something. I'm just wondering why someone painted him. || No matter how popular you are as a stand-up - you can go out and fill a 10,000-seat arena and be smart and funny - it's delicate to host an awards show and know where your place is and know that it's not about you, that it's about the people who are nominated, and respect that, but at the same time have your moment to show them who you are. || The only thing that scares me more than space aliens is the idea that there aren't any space aliens. We can't be the best that creation has to offer. I pray we're not all there is. If so, we're in big trouble. || Stuffed deer heads on walls are bad enough, but it’s worse when you see them wearing dark glasses, having streamers around their necks and a hat on their antlers. Because then you know they were enjoying themselves at a party when they were shot. || It makes a big difference in your life when you stay positive. || You know, it's hard work to write a book. I can't tell you how many times I really get going on an idea, then my quill breaks. Or I spill ink all over my writing tunic. No wonder I drink so much! Then I get so drunk, I can barely feed the baby. That's what I call myself when I'm drunk, ""The Baby."" || You say you're sick and tired of hearing about me? I've got news for you: I'm sick and tired of hearing about me. || I'm a godmother, that's a great thing to be, a godmother. She calls me god for short, that's cute, I taught her that. || I'm on the patch right now. Where it releases small dosages of approval until I no longer crave it, and then I'm gonna rip it off. || I feel like I have a hangover, without all the happy memories and mystery bruises. || We're putting a face on something that a lot of people don't understand, ... And we want to give people some information before they make up their minds and judge us. || You know that song that asks, ""Why do fools fall in love?""? I think the obvious answer is because they're fools. || There's lotion for your face, for your hands, for your feet, for your body. Why? What would happen if you put hand lotion on your feet? Would your feet get confused and start clapping? Each kind has something special in it - aloe, shea butter, coconut, cocoa butter, vanilla, lemon extract. That's not lotion. That's one ingredient short of a Bundt cake. || I guess I don't have to point this out, that it's the second time I've hosted the Emmys after a national tragedy. And I just want to say that I'm honored because it's times like this that we really need laughter. || The world is full of a lot of fear and a lot of negativity, and a lot of judgment. I just think people need to start shifting into joy and happiness. As corny as it sounds, we need to make a shift. || I used to beat myself up about weight and working out, and no matter what I did I never felt good about myself. I decided to accept myself and know that I am good. || You know how you always expect someone to think the same as you and then your like, really shocked when they don't? Like when it's a cold day and you turn to the person next to you and say, 'Its so cold, aren't you cold?' and then they say 'no.' It's kinda like, 'what, are you a communist?' || I love clothes, so when I wear clothes, they're usually somebody's. You know, I'm not wearing Kmart. || Here are the values that I stand for: honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. || Our flaws are what makes us human. If we can accept them as part of who we are, they really don't even have to be an issue. || I believe everything in life is energy. If we're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, there's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that."
Emo Philips,"England is better only because I stand out there as 'unusual'. || Women: You can't live with them, and you can't get them to dress up in a skimpy little Nazi costume and beat you with a warm squash or something. || I'm a great lover, I'll bet. || When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realised that the Lord doesn't work that way so I stole one and asked Him to forgive me. || People always ask me, 'Where were you when Kennedy was shot?' Well, I don't have an alibi. || I ran five miles today. Then, finally, I said, 'Here, lady... take your purse.' || I discovered my wife in bed with another man, and I was crushed. So I said, 'Get off me, you two!' || I was the kid next door's imaginary friend. || He taught me never to smile, which helps me when I visit disaster sites. || Race is still somewhat of a taboo in comedy. But if you’re a minority, then you can make fun of your own minority. And that’s a nice service that many of them provide. || My classmates would copulate with anything that moved, but I never saw any reason to limit myself. || The other night a homeless man was going through my garbage. Now I hate to see a human being going through someone’s garbage, so I made him a real nice racoon costume. || I was at the airport trying to pick up my mother. Well, it was dark in that lounge... || I grew up in an era when strange adults would grab me on the street and say: ’Don’t do that.’ You never see that these days. ‘Hi, we took the liberty of spanking your son.’ Oh thanks, my hand was getting worn. || All the nations of the earth must learn to live together in peace. Why be prejudiced against anyone because of their race, nationality, or creed? When there’s so many real reasons to hate others. || The battle of the sexes will never be won as long as we keep sleeping with the enemy. || Well! I feel happy these days. I've started taking a herbal anti-depressant. It's called Saint John's Wort. Apparently it's the best-selling anti-depressant in many places. It's the most popular anti-depressant in Germany... After, I'm guessing, amnesia... || I was walking down the street, something caught my eye... and dragged it fifteen feet. || New York's such a wonderful city. Although I was at the library today. The guys are very rude. I said, ""I'd like a card."" He says, ""You have to prove you're a citizen of New York."" So I stabbed him. || When I wake up in the morning, I just can't get started until I've had that first, piping hot pot of coffee. Oh, I've tried other enemas. || The way I understand it, the Russians are sort of a combination of evil and incompetence... sort of like the Post Office with tanks. || My computer beat me at checkers, but I sure beat it at kickboxing. || Every time I see Dan Quayle I feel like buying a vowel. || Every night my wife used to give me a foot massage. And my face would smell weird afterwards, but... || The other night, the president gave a speech. He said, “children are our most prescious natural resource”. I thought, “let’s hope it never comes to that”. || The other day I was sitting on the stoop. That’s a stupid nick-name. I’m mean my Aunt Bessie. || Because we allow handguns. When you know someone in the crowd might be packing a rod, it can't help but rush your timing. || Coming up with a funny joke is like falling in love: It can hit you any time, anywhere. Having said that, the more you put yourself out there, the better your odds will be. || I don’t really hang out with people. I like to be by myself. In fact, I’ve been arrested a few times because I like to walk around at two or three in the morning, looking at shop windows. The cops take me to the station and fingerprint me. But I wouldn’t call that hanging out. || Writer’s block is a myth. I never see the gardeners suffering from gardening block. || If you’re worth over $50m you should have to dress like that guy on the Monopoly box. The super-rich shouldn’t get all the benefits of looking like a regular guy. || Nepal is the most fun place in the world. You’ve got monkeys roaming around, cremations and animal sacrifices. And there’s no vehicle that you’re not welcome to ride on top of. The country could have been invented by Beavis and Butt-head. Even the gods have nice breasts. || Charlie Chaplin is the greatest artist of the 20th century. He takes me from laughter to tears in seconds. And he was one of the very first funny men. It’s like the original violins were made in Cremona and there’s never been any better since. Sometimes the best come right off the bat. || People come up to me and say, ""Emo, do people really come up to you?"" || There’s a joke in everything, the trick is finding it. The best compliment a joke can get is what Huxley said about Darwin’s theory of evolution - ‘Why didn’t I think of that?’ || Writing jokes for others is like having babies for someone else. It’s sad. Like the woman who gives up her baby but needs to be close so she secretly becomes the maid in the household. || My cousin just died. He was only 19. He got stung by a bee - the natural enemy of a tightrope walker. || I woke up with a bloody nose this morning. I said, 'yeech, who threw that in there?' || I was walking through the park... plucking out nose hairs. Oh, those sleeping winos hate that. || My nephew said, ""Uncle Emo, are you giving me a puppy for Christmas?"" I said, ""Now, now! You've been shaking the box, haven't you?"" || I'm from Downer's Grove, Illinois. We had a blackout there the other day, but fortunately the police made him get back into his car before he got too far. || My girlfriend and I almost didn't have the second date because on the first date I didn't open the car door for her… I just swam to the surface. || I was walking through the park. I had a very bad asthmatic attack. These three asthmatics attacked me. I know... I should have heard them hiding. || Cell phones are like a dog’s nipples. You don’t have to shout into them. || I’d be in the backyard minding my own business. The other kids would call me names, like meatball head or neo-Calvinist. I’d run after them, but lucky for them the chain would snap my neck back… || Not everybody hates me. Only the people who’ve met me. || I thought I was raptured up into the air today; turns out, it was just my gas oven exploding. || The only work I ever turned down was a cable programme called Diving for Excrement. || I once had a large gay following, but I ducked into an alleyway and lost him. || I saw an old woman changing a flat tyre, and I walked right by, like everybody else. Then I thought what kind of person am I? So I went back and said, 'Have a nice day.' || I’ll do anything for my wife, it’s turning out. || Isn't this a wonderful country? I was in Florida. I'm staying at a motel called the Three Palms. It's run by a middle-aged couple, one of whom is missing a hand. OK! That's what I thought, too! But they got upset when I asked. || Once I posed naked for a magazine, but it was very demeaning, and I've never been back to that newsstand. || Oh yes, I've tried my hand at sex. || When I was a kid my dad would say, ""Emo, do you believe in the Lord?"" I'd say, ""Yes!"" He'd say, ""Then stand up and shout Hallelujah!"" So I would... and I'd fall out of the roller coaster.  || I don't know if I have sexual magnetism or animal magnetism, though sometimes I'll find a squirrel stuck to my forehead. || You know how when you pee in the toilet it sounds like a chipmunk commanding you to kill Kenny G? || They call me ""Good Time Emo"". Because I love a good time! And my name is Emo. || My girlfriend said, ""Just buy me something crazy and expensive, something I don't even need!"" So, I signed her up for radiation treatment. || A beautiful woman chased me down the street yesterday. She shouted and screamed, tried to grab me, ripped my at my clothes and pulled my hair. After about five minutes, I said, ""Okay, lady. Keep your handbag."" || When I was ten, my family moved to Downer’s Grove, Illinois. When I was twelve, I found them. || I met this girl at a rock concert once, and we went back to her place. She lit some candles and incense and said, ‘All right, Emo, you make the next move.’ …So I sacrificed her poodle to Zorkon the Space God. || My parents had very strict rules for me. Rules like, I couldn't be home until a certain hour. || There’s only one joke that I do in England that doesn’t work in the States. It goes: ‘There was no place to eat last night, so I went to a kebab shop and had a doner. Which my body rejected.’ But you don’t get doners in America. They don’t exist. || Recently, I've ventured into the mammal family - so that's good for my sex life. || Countries are making nuclear weapons like there is no tomorrow. || My dad always said, ""If someone hands you a lemon, make lemonade"". Plus that also works wonderfully as a metaphor. || One man's pet-stained carpet is another man's Twister game. || I was in New York City, performing at an epilepsy benefit. Had ‘em rolling in the aisles. || I give money to Unicef because I like the ‘bang for your buck’ aspect. Here’s $10, go and save 1,000 kids from blindness! || My friend said to me, ""You're unreal - you'd fuck anything with a pulse!"" A pulse? I'm not that fussy! || I tried body surfing once, but how often do you find a corpse? || I ran into a woman I dated last year. I said, ""You gave me a rash!"" She said, ""Put something on it."" I said, ""OK. Ten bucks says it was you."" || Everyone, everywhere, and all the time, used to laugh at me when I was growing up. So, when I was around 18, I thought, 'I'll become a comedian, and then if everyone laughs at me, I'll be famous.' So I went on stage one night and, for the first time in my life, everyone stopped laughing at me. || I'm not a Republican... but I am saving up to be one. || The nicest present I ever got was an exploding suppository. || Tori is a teenage girl studying drama, which is kinda like a Mexican taking Spanish. || I used to think I knew everything, but older you get the more you see other areas. If you could read everything about both sides, you’ll pretty much be in the middle again, which is the state you had when you were totally ignorant. So my theory is if you maintain total ignorance - which isn’t easy, but I try - you’ll be just as far ahead as if you’d spent days and days reading about the whole issue. And you have that much extra time to play Pac-man. || I'm learning Cuban. It's like Spanish, but with fewer words for luxury items. || For some reason, religious jokes seem as trivial as jokes about food or driving. || I read that nine out of 10 women fantasize about having an unknown man leap through their bedroom window at night and make mad, passionate love to them. Who would think with those odds, I would now be facing 150 hours of community service. || I think of people as members of an audience. But an audience acts independently of every individual. It’s an organism on its own. I focus on that living hydra in the dark. || The Scots are a very tough people. They have drive-by headbuttings. In Glasgow a sweatband is considered a silencer. || I had an argument with my father. I argued that Plato was the Father of Philosophy. My dad takes the opposite position: that I should wax the kitchen floor. I said, “Well, the kitchen floor doesn’t exist, at least not in the permanent sense that the concept ‘floor’ does.” He said “Do you think the concept ‘your skull’ exists?” I said “Yes.” And then he surprised me by juxtaposing the two concepts. || I'm very religious, you know. Now, OK, if by 'religious', you mean that I go to church every Sunday, read the bible faithfully, and I listen to Debbie Boone, umm, I'm not religious in that sense... But if by 'religious' you mean that I love others and try to help them whenever possible... Again, no. But if by 'religious' you mean that I like to eat coleslaw... Yeah, OK, OK! || I don't have to tell you folks about scuba diving. So, that'll save some time. || When I was a kid, I slept on rubber sheets, but now, I'm a man. And I can take the wetness! || I'm not as good a swimmer as I used to be - thanks to evolution. || 'You look slinky,' I said to her at the top of the stairs. || I go from stool to stool in singles bars hoping to get lucky, but there's never any gum under any of them. || Girls throw their panties on the stage, but rarely if ever do they fit. || I understand if you want to stay home and watch me on YouTube, but it’s like incest - you’re putting convenience over quality. || My ex-girlfriend, who shall remain nameless – if I’m ever left alone at her tombstone with a sandblaster. || Some comedians change their style, often to their advantage; but I see no reason why I can't continue with the ""urbane sophisticate"" till the day I die. || A friend of mine gave me a Philip Glass record. I listened to it for five hours before I realized it had a scratch on it. || I was in the park, pulling out stray nose hairs with my pliers. Those sleeping winos hate it when you do that. || A Mormon told me that they don't drink coffee. I said, ""A cup of coffee every day gives you wonderful benefits."" He said, ""Like what?"" I said, ""Well, it keeps you from being Mormon..."" || I love to go to the playground and watch the children jumping up and down. They don't know I'm firing blanks. || Thinking up jokes is easy. The hard part is trying them out on stage, because you never know if they’re funny until you get there. Not one comedian in the world ever really knows. || Did you know that a single fur coat takes 14 trees just for the protest signs? || I was pulled over in Massachusetts for reckless driving. When brought before the judge, I was asked if I knew what the punishment for drunk driving in that state was. I said, ""I don't know... reelection to the Senate?"" || I don’t know if I was put on this Earth for a purpose or not. But I’m fairly confident that I’ll be taken off of it for one. || I used to get drunk every night until I puked. Finally I admitted, “I am a bulemic”. || At family gatherings in the holidays, there was always some aunt, you know, with a moustache and a wart on her head, and she gives you a big sloppy kiss, ssssshhhhhkkkkk, you know, but when you try to go further with her... Oh boy. You know! || I was a cute baby. My mom said when I was born they threw away the mold. Some of it grew back. || I love England. In fact, they're getting to know me so well at Heathrow Immigration that this time I was able to completely bypass the six months rabies quarantine. || My sister gained 80 pounds expecting her baby. Well, you get nervous, waiting for those adoption papers to clear. || What’s the difference between a jazz guitarist and a pepperoni pizza? A pizza can feed a family of four. || My girlfriend said to me in bed last night' 'you're a pervert' I said, 'that's a big word for a girl of nine'. || You know what I hate? Indian givers... no, I take that back. || Sex is logically impossible after marriage. You have to overcome the paradox of ""Not this again,"" and ""Hey, where did you learn that?"" || You don't appreciate a lot of stuff in school until you get older. Little things like being spanked every day by a middle-aged woman: Stuff you pay good money for in later life. || My grandmother’s brain was dead, but her heart was still beating; it was the first time we ever had a Democrat in the family. || I was in the ROTC program. I remember once I was walking through campus and my instructor grabs me, and he’s a real big guy, and yells, “It’s been six weeks since I’ve seen you in camouflage class!” I said, “I’m getting good.” || Probably the worst time in a person's life is when they have to kill a family member because they are the devil. But otherwise it's been a pretty good day. || I love to go down to the schoolyard and watch all the little children jump up and down and run around yelling and screaming. They don't know I'm only using blanks. || My mother was like a sister to me, only we didn't have sex quite so often. || I'm not a fatalist. But even if I were, what could I do about it? || Capital punishment turns the state into a murderer. But imprisonment turns he state into a gay dungeon-master. || I'm not Catholic, but I gave up picking my belly button for lint. || I got a letter from the IRS. Apparently I owe them $800. So I sent them a letter back. I said, ""If you'll remember, I fastened my return with a paper clip, which according to your very own latest government pentagon spending figures will more than make up for the difference."" || Once my mom caught me in bed with a chicken. Boy, was there egg on my face! || Well, aren't you a saucy sack of estrogen? || I think the whole concept of monotheism is a gift from the gods. || Santa Fe is fun to visit, but property there will cost you an arm and a dillo. || I’ve always thought the best way to teach a kid not to be scared of the dark is to fill his daylight hours with as much horror as possible. || I had a very close relationship with another kid when I was growing up. I was his imaginary friend. || Last year, I donated $10,000 to deprived inner-city kids. Not... voluntarily... || So if there are any ladies out there who fancy a little Emo action... well... I don't want to blow my own horn... Which is why I'm making this offer tonight. || You know, a lot of girls go out with me just to further their careers... damn anthropologists. || I went into the gas station, said, ""Fill 'er up, Harry."" The guy said, ""Regular?"" I said, ""No, put on a gorrila suit and dance like a fairy."" || I read somewhere that 77 percent of all the mentally ill live in poverty. Actually, I'm more intrigued by the 23 percent who are apparently doing quite well for themselves. || Pentiums melt in your PC, not in your hand. || I saw a woman wearing a sweatshirt with 'Guess' on it. I said, 'Thyroid problem?' || Computers aren't intelligent, they only think they are. || I like to play chess with bald men in the park although it's hard to find 32 of them. || I found our cat the other day. I would have found him a week ago, but we have a grass bag on our lawnmower. || My teacher was by and large.... but anyway. || I wanted to get from 4th street to 8th... Then I remembered Einstein postulating that parallel lines eventually meet. They're dredging my car from Lake Michigan as we speak. || My girlfriend always laughs during sex-no matter what she's reading. || I was with this girl the other night and from the way she was responding to my skillful caresses, you would have sworn that she was conscious from the top of her head to the tag on her toes. || My sister just had a baby. We can have company over. She’ll be in front of everyone with her um… breast… out feeding it. You know… cereal or whatever. || I was walking down the street the other day and these construction workers were working on the roof hammering away. One of them told me I was a paranoid lunatic... in morse code. || So I'm trying to undress this woman with my eyes... but I got them caught in her zipper. || Whatever happened to the good ole days, when children worked in factories? || How many people here have telekenetic powers? Raise my hand. || I used to think that the brain was the most wonderful organ in my body. Then I realized who was telling me this. || What is eternity? You're on the checkout line at a supermarket. There are seven people in front of you. They are all old. They all have two carts and coupons for every item. They are all paying by check. None of them have ID. It's the checkout girl's first day on the job. She doesn't speak any English. Take away fifteen minutes from that, and you begin to get an idea of what eternity is. || I was walking down fifth avenue today and I found a wallet, and I was gonna keep it, rather than return it, but I thought: well, if I lost a hundred and fifty dollars, how would I feel? And I realized I would want to be taught a lesson. || So, I pleaded guilty on advice of the lawyer, which is the last time I ever listen to a prosecuting attorney. || When I was a kid my parents used to tell me, ""Emo, don't go near the cellar door!"" One day when they were away, I went up to the cellar door. And I pushed it and walked through and saw strange, wonderful things, things I had never seen before, like... trees, grass, flowers, the sun... that was nice... || When I was young, my father had a serious heart attack. He survived, but we lost our house and car. Under the Canadian Medicare system, though, we would have kept the house and car and would have just had to pay the inheritance tax. || My sister married a German. He complained he couldn't get a good bagel back home. I said: 'Well, whose fault is that?' || It's amazing where a joke might come from. I find a lot of humour just by metaphorically turning things upside down or literally like my wife's cat. || I saw a psychologist once because I thought I had depression. It cost me $100. When I left, I realised that there's nothing he could have said that would cheer me up as much as if I found a $100 bill on my way home. || Now there's a seven-day waiting period to buy a gun. Who can stay mad that long? || When I went to college, my parents threw a going away party for me, according to the letter. || I have a lot more things to talk about now because I'm an adult. || People ask me how much I weigh. I tell them, 145 pounds, naked. That is, if that scale outside the drugstore is anything to go by. || I found our cat the other day. I would have found him a week ago, but we’ve got a grass bag on the lawn mower. || The other day a woman came up to me and said, ""Didn't I see you on television?"" I said, ""I don't know. You can't see out the other way."" || I love Florida. I love the beach. I love the sound of the crashing surfers against the rocks. || When I was a kid, my nickname was Mr. Baseball. Because of the stitches. || I told my wife she looks sexy with black fingernails. Now she thinks I slammed the car door on her hand on purpose. || My first job as a kid was going from door to door selling Christmas cards, to raise money for my grandmother's hip replacement. Because, you know... You break it, you buy it. || I got a job at an amusement park. I like to make the rides more terrifying by throwing a couple of screws onto the seats. || My ex-girlfriend was very sexy. She reminded me of the Sphinx because she was very mysterious and eternal and solid... and her nose was shot off by French soldiers.  || If you can make just one person laugh, then you are already doing better than Tony Danza. || I think of my body as a temple. Or at least a relatively well-managed Presbyterian youth center. || Libertarians believe consenting adults have the right to do whatever they choose, except band together. || My dad and I, we used to play baseball. I was the catcher. Which I liked. Until one day, I saw this game on TV, and I said, ""Hang on, how come their catcher doesn't have his hands tied to his ankles?"" || So I'm at the wailing wall, standing there like a moron, with my harpoon. || I was sleeping the other night, alone, thanks to the exterminator. || Before I left for college, my dad said, 'you know, son, I'm going to miss you.' I said, 'I know; that's because I broke the sights off your shotgun.' || I got pulled over by the cops because I was swerving a bit while trying to change the radio. It was a shame, 'cos I'd almost disconnected the old one. || Always remember the last words of my grandfather, who said: 'A truck!' || I was at the Wal-Mart, which is where I think everybody goes eventually. If they die without Christ. || Once I was in a restaurant and I dropped my fork on the floor, and they gave me a new fork. So I pushed my girlfriend out of her chair. || I was sent to the principal's office for copying...they heard my Minolta running. The principal said 'Emo, Emo, Emo.' I said 'I'm the one in the middle, you lousy drunk!' He said, ""do you know I could have you expelled?' I said 'yes, but you'll have to eat me first.' || I used to be scared of pretty girls, until one confessed they’re just as scared of me. || Well, my brother says ""hello""! So, hooray for speech therapy. || I was sick of people making fun of my hair and so I cut it off and I've got much more attention than ever before. It was like when Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre in 1906 - three times more people came to see where it used to be. || When I die, I want to go quietly in my sleep, like my grandfather - not screaming, like the passengers in his car. || I lent a friend of mine $10,000 for plastic surgery and now I don’t know what he looks like. || Once I beat up the school bully with a baseball bat. Both his arms were completely broken, which gave me the courage. || You know what I hate the most? People that imitate owls. || The highway cop said, “Walk a straight line.” I said, “Well, Officer Pythagoras, the closest you could ever come to achieving a straight line would be making an electroencephalogram of your own brain waves.” He said, “You’re under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Do you wish to retain that right?” I thought, “Oooh, a paradox!” || I got some new underwear the other day. Well, new to me. || I once heard two ladies going on and on about the pains of childbirth and how men don't seem to know what real pain is. I asked if either of them ever got themselves caught in a zipper. || Actually, my cd was released in 1985, in return for two German missionaries and a Dutch urologist. || In our school you were searched for guns and knifes on the way in and if you didn't have any, they gave you some. || Sometimes my mother goes through my socks and underwear. I wouldn't mind, but it tickles so much! || A few days ago, it was my birthday, and it was in the newspaper, and growing up I never would have guessed that a) my name would be in the newspaper, and b) that I might outlast those papers. || I go to pick up a girl in a bar. I say will you go home with me? She says I don’t know, do you have cable? I say no, but the rope should work just fine. || They always have a sign at the beach, ""no glass bottles"". I think that's so the other sand particles don't feel like under-achievers. || My girlfriend said, ""Emo, I'm seeing another man."" I said, ""Well, try rubbing your eyes or something."" || I always wanted a beautiful loving wife and she always wanted to be a citizen. || I never cheated on my wife. I took seriously those vows of celibacy. || Ambiguity - the Devil’s volleyball. || My mom gave me one of those cloth calendars for the kitchen. It took me three hours to sew in a dental appointment. || I learned about sex the hard way… from books. || When deciding between two competing theories, always go with the one that doesn't involve a magic spell. || My parents were very protective of me. Whenever I went to cross the street, they would get very excited and start making bets. || When I was a kid, my goodness, corporate America was a bunch of stolid white guys in gray suits trying to be serious, and now it's stolid white guys in gray suits trying to be funny. || I’ve always had a special place in my heart for old women digging through garbage bins. They saved my life so many times as a baby. || I asked my girlfriend, 'Will you marry me?' She said, 'We'll have to ask my father.' So we had a seance and Jack Ruby says, 'Hello!' || My jokes are in my head and I have a duplicate copy of my jokes in a lot of British comics' heads, where they are safe. || I picked up a hitch hiker. You've got to when you hit them. || Some mornings, it's just not worth chewing through the leather straps. || I was at a bar nursing a beer. My nipple was getting quite soggy. || When I was a kid, my favourite time of the year when I was child was that magical first snowfall. I'd yell ""Yippee! Snow!"" and run up to the front door and shout ""You know the deal... You have to let me in now."" || I think fur looks better on an animal than on a human being. So I dress my dog in a mink teddy. || I was at a disco a few nights ago. I was tearing up the dance floor. I had a nail in my shoe. || I’m totally normal in every respect, but I have this one quirk - I can’t give out a number without laughing. It’s a problem when I’m giving my credit card number over the phone because they always think: ‘He must have just stolen it.’ || I caught my wife in bed with my best friend the other day. I was crushed. They could have waited till I'd got out. || I went into Gus's artificial organ and taco stand. I said ""Give me a bladder por favor."" The guy said ""Is that to go?"" I said, ""Well what else would I want it for?"" || Christmas seems to start earlier and earlier every year. Like, this time, it's on December 25th. || All prayers are basically a request: ""Please break the laws of the physical universe for my convenience. Amen."" || I love my family. I came home the other days. My brother's passed-out on the couch, holding an empty bottle of sleeping pills. So I called the paramedics, and they pumped his stomach, and I think he's learned his lesson: you know, never to take my last two sleeping pills. || I don’t know how electricity works. All I know is that it calms me. || I think my ex-girlfriend has weekly lessons with the devil on how to be more evil. I don’t know what she charges him. || But I like to swim. At high school, I tried out for the swim team. I shaved off all my body hair, and that extra burst of speed from all the bullies shouting ""Kill the fairy""... || But don't you hate it, guys? You're at the beach and there's no place to change into your trunks. So you wrap a towel around yourself, so no-one sees your face. || I had the weirdest experience. I'm walking here and I say to myself ""my gosh, that's Jimmy Petersen. I haven't seen him since I was nine"". And I walked up to him and I slapped him on the back and I said ""how's it going, you old rascal?"" And he starts crying... And I say to myself, ""wait a second, if that's Jimmy Petersen, he would have grown up too!"" I mean, sure, now it's obvious... || In school I was never the class clown, but more the class trapeze artist, as I was always being suspended. || I am in the army and my sergeant said to me, ""I didn't see you at camouflage training this morning!"" To which I replied, ""Oh, thank you very much, sir!"" || I went to school, you know. I was in grammar school. Once we were taking a test. I was copying this other kid’s paper, and I guess the teacher heard my Xerox machine. And she said, “Emo, am I stupid or were you cheating?” I said, “Ah, yes and no.” || People come up to me... concerned... that I'll reproduce. || I got in a fight one time with a really big guy, and he said, 'I'm going to mop the floor with your face.' I said, 'You'll be sorry.' He said, 'Oh, yeah? Why?' I said, 'Well, you won't be able to get into the corners very well.' || At my lemonade stand I used to give the first glass away free and charge five dollars for the second glass. The refill contained the antidote."
Eugene Mirman,"Over the years I've received thousands of e-mails looking for guidance. Some have real problems; some talk about monkeys and poo - though those people may also have real problems. || Whatever makes “Hey Ya” good, it is the evil side of that. It is the anti-matter to the matter of “Hey Ya.” || People used to make fun of alternative comedy because sometimes it would be someone being funny, and sometimes it was a crazy man with a flute making no sense. And it's very easy to be like, ""yeah, that's not really comedy."" || It's easy to sit on a mountaintop and tell people what to do and how to be happy. I have chosen to do that. Not because it's easy, but for a different reason, which I would reveal, if your mind was ready to handle it, which it isn't, which is also very convenient for me. || I was at peace with it; I'd taken his hatred and insecurity-driven malice and turned it into fame, money, and of course, pussy. || Is the square root of hate the same thing as love times love? || I don’t think you should invest in commodities. Eddie Murphy made it seem risky in Trading Places. || Sorry about your continent, but it’s time to make money. || Before going home with a guy, give him a blow job. Guys are always more relaxed after a blow job. || What do you think you should do if you’re attacked by a bear? Play dead? No - that’s a lie promoted by the bears. || They put me in Special Ed because they thought I was slow, but I stayed in Special Ed for the ladies. || They waited until I was 20 to tell me I was adopted, and then last Christmas, they told me they were kidding. || Everyone knows that Jews control the media and banks and stuff. But did you know that when you go to a carnival and you have to be a certain height to go on a ride, Jews control that height? It has nothing to do with safety. It’s just us flexing our Semitic muscles. || I got a wake up call - not like, 'Stop doing heroin.' Like in a hotel. || A lot of people think that kids say the darnedest things. But so would you if you had no education. You’d just be like, ""I am bike cheese."" Because you wouldn’t know what words were. || Oh, Hello. I'm Eugene Mirman, and I'm here to introduce my special. It's called ""An Evening of Comedy in a Fake Underground Laboratory"". || I believe in diversification of income, because you never know what will happen. I’m a slightly paranoid person who thinks things could be ruined at any time. || The good thing about being stuck at the airport for an extra hour, is that it gives you a chance to give weary travelers surprise massages. || I don’t know what it would be like to actually play guitar. I’ve toured with a lot of comedians and it’s never been like it is for a rock band. || The only thing wrong with me was that I was a weirdo that hated school. I’m sure now there’d be a disorder for it, but I was just an oddball. || I laugh at weird times - at good and bad things alike. I laugh simply when things are incongruous. It’s not necessarily a judgment - as it is noticing the oddity of something. || I saw this huge billboard that said: 'Abortion Hurts' and then it had a drawing of a butterfly. Who is that for? Is there a lady who's going to see that and be like, 'Oh, I was going to get an abortion but now that I realize it hurts I guess I'll just give birth to a child. 'Cause I know that's painless and raising it should be a snap.' || Why is no one talking about all the potential savings from a complete economic collapse? || If you're walking down a street, it is never funny to pick up a child and run. || I think in Russia, there's a lot of storytelling and anecdotes. || On a quick side note, I would argue that - much like Samuel L. Jackson - I am not arrogant at all; I'm just actually really, really great. || 6th grade. My dog, Katie, is hit by a car and killed. A mean girl during recess says it committed suicide because it didn't love me. I cry and swear revenge on mankind. || Sports bars are also a great place for guys to meet other guys - either for sex or for wrestling, whichever feels more right. || Do whatever you want. Break stuff, touch your penis or boobs to anything, whatever. || Try not to wake up on fire. || There's nothing sexier than a girl who's like, 'I know who FDR is, I know about the New Deal, I'm going to give you a new deal.' and then, over a period of years, she structures her sex acts in such a way that they save the economy. || A comedian is simply a different kind of therapist. A comedian is a psychologist and a psychiatrist rolled into one. Except I can't prescribe medicine. You still need a doctorate, which is bullshit. Okay, so I'm not like a psychiatrist. Fine. But I'm still like a psychologist, except I can't diagnose or treat mental illness. || Some tips for life: 1. Don't be afraid to follow your dreams, unless your dreams are stupid. 2. Be kind to people. 3. Don't get too excited when you read the Fountainhead. 4. In times of recession, it is time for invention. 5. Things can kill you, so keep that in mind, you fearless know it alls. || I was in Vancouver, and I was in what I was told was the poorest neighborhood in North America - which I find very hard to believe because has anyone here ever been to Detroit? || To create a comedy major, I ended up starting a comedy night in the basement of my dorm, and I promoted and produced my final project, which meant I faxed press releases from an old Apple IIC, or whatever it was, to newspapers, not knowing if that would work or if that's how you do things. || Boys have penises and girls have vaginas. If they touch at the wrong time, you can make a baby or die. || One of the best things I found out about Detroit is that bears have started returning to the city. When bears are gentrifying your neighborhood and opening Thai restaurants, that's a poor neighborhood. || I was driving back from Delaware to New York. Don't bother. || It's weird - the cab driver is playing very loud dance music and yet it doesn't really feel like a party. || Think of me as an impetuous Hegel, drunk with power, and also, regular drunk. || Is it okay to go the roof of the tallest building in your town and jerk off into the street? || Like if you're Jewish you have to wear a hat, but only in the middle of your head. But it all becomes clear the second that you realize that God is a 12-year-old boy with Asperger's. || Comedy clubs were something that came to pass in the '80s, but toward the end of that, in the early '90s, people started doing comedy again in alternative spaces. || I’m fascinated by the logic that leads to something. || I just loved comedy as a kid and I think at some point, it just occurred to me that you could try it, and I did. || Are you moving so quick now that it seems like time has stopped? || One of the things that’s funniest about the entertainment industry and comedy is that people go ‘Oh, you’re great, but I don’t know what to do with you.’ The great thing about the Internet is that nobody has to figure out what to do with you. You can figure out what to do with you, and you can say, ‘I made this thing, and I’m going to put it out, and now if people want to come see me and buy things from me they can.’ || You can do anything you want, as long as it works. || School, in general, was not great. Children are just mean to each other… but by high school, I probably stopped being annoying to people, and people stopped being mean. By the end of it, it was wonderful. || A young senator came to me one Tuesday afternoon and said, ‘I want to be the next president of the United States.’ I looked at him, made him get into a sensory deprivation tank and answer a few deceptively simple questions, and after about an hour I said, ‘Okay, kid, let’s do this.’ That person, of course, was John F. Kennedy. || High School: Oh, man. This is where boys and girls go from tweens to teens and become complicated and cruel. Girls play sick mind games; boys try to pull each other's penises off and throw them in the bushes. If you can, buy the most expensive jeans in a two-hundred-mile radius of your town and wear them on your first day. If anyone asks how you could afford them say that your father is the president of Ashton Kutcher. When they are like, 'Ashton Kutcher has a president?' answer, 'Yes.' Everyone will be in awe of you and you won't have to go through a lot of pain and cat fights. || I think that I would be a good father… especially if my baby liked to go out drinking. || Let's start anew. Life is goals - Purpose-Attempts - Struggle-Dreams and Accomplishmenties. It sounds confusing (my fault), but it's actually simple. || Some PR is about getting information about a great product or thingy out to the people who would enjoy it, while other PR is about creating a web of lies that conceals the fact that your company harnesses the energy produced by rape and uses it to make a chemical that kills forests for fun. Either way, you're going to need it. || Prom night can be a special night, if you let it be. I know you think it's for losers and something that popular kids do because they are boring people with porcelain hearts who don't know what it means to be lonely. But you're wrong. Prom is a chance for everyone to try oral sex. Go for it. || In America, ""Qualification"" is simply an attitude. I've adopted it. So, yes. I am qualified. || If you're at a party with more than five people named Chad, get the fuck out right away. || A lot of the things I do are the sort of things I think are funny. || I saw that Linens 'N Things was going out of business. I know. My first thought was, 'Should have been more specific.' || The truth is, for however much my stories come out of things that have happened to me, they're not darkly or as deeply personal as someone like Marc Maron or a lot of comedians, but they are essentially my life and my interpretation of it. || Yes, I'm known as America's most genuine comedian. || There's this billboard in my neighborhood, and it says, 'Don't leave a baby anywhere,' which is true. I imagine the first rule of baby is to not leave it in the street. Don't even leave it with a knife or a sword - even Excalibur. || Marriage is when two people love each other so much that they promise that if they ever, ever stop they'll fill out tons of paperwork. || I went to high school in Lexington, Massachusetts, which in hindsight was very nice. || You are an alchemist who can turn six beers into an awkward three week relationship. || I don't speak French, but I took it for five years growing up. So, if I were in a situation where I had to be, like, 'Excuse me, pineapple dog house red, what time is it library?' - no problem. || Never give in to peer pressure, especially if the peer is not attractive. || Entertainment is business: the business of fucking art in the face. || Don't throw a baby at anything - even a burglar. || I spent the day today at Brighton Beach, walking around. It's a Russian/Jewish neighborhood. And I was in a store and I saw a board game called 'Let My People Go,' based on the Jews' exodus from Egypt. I was like, 'Too soon.' || You know how sometimes when you're drunk you say something you sort of regret... to Ace Frehley? || If this is airing in the future and no one knows who Karl Rove is, he's the reason you all live underground. || For a short period of time, I was like, ""I have these jokes and if people get them, they get them."" And then eventually, I was like, ""Oh no. It's absolutely my job to convey to people why what I think is funny, is funny. The whole point of standup is to get the audience to understand your weird point of view. || Most bullies are the product of a stressful and often abusive home life. Next time a bully threatens or attacks you, just yell, 'Don't abuse me like your parents abuse you!' Then call children's services and tell them you saw this bully crying in the bathroom and you're worried about him. Bam! He just got moved to a foster home. || If you really really don’t like someone, like you really don’t like someone, buy them a pony. Cause, ""You know what, fuck you! Take care of this pony!"" || Some of the shit marijuana does - we had no idea. Pot doesn't just kill the person who smokes it. It kills everyone within a mile around. || On a scale of one to ten, how punk am I? Apple. I don't use your scale. || I forget, is freedom of speech when it's legal to say what you want or is it when it has no consequences for some reason? || You tried to kiss me. I know you have $40. Thank you all so very, very, very much. You are the best! Thank you!. We did it, team. We did it. Good night, America. Good night, San Francisco. Good night, foreign countries with distribution from Comedy Central. I will now leave energetically to match your energy! || I remember the first time I had sex. I wore a cape and goggles… because I didn’t know. || There was one woman who had a giant sign and on it, it just said, 'America Is Better Than Abortion.' I think she meant that America was too good a place for the horror of abortion. But instead, it sounded like she had weighed both - the American spirit and getting an abortion and decided that American spirit better. I think it is a bad idea to have grammatically ambiguous protest signs. || I moved recently and I moved my cable and Internet and phone service which was all provided by Time Warner Cable. And you know, I made a plan with them where they'd come sometime between summer solstice and winter solstice and I would wait. || You just can't make up random information and say it sarcastically and have it make sense. You can't just be like, 'I went out on a date with a Jewish girl. She was more rude than a wolfcat - an animal I've made up and decided is rude.' || Imagine the wars we would've avoided if prior generations had a website where they could debate tragedy and politics in terse sentences? || Don't get me wrong - I'll put $25 on the ground and then if you pick it up and we have sex in an alley, that's not a crime. That's a coincidence. || When years from now people look back on today, they will think the same thing they already do but with more reasons for it. || You wanna know what a gateway drug is? It opens a gate. || I don't have any rules, so don't invite me to game night. || I can kill a dog in six ways. Five of them are throwing missiles at it. || I was in a fish market, and there was a little boy behind the counter, about nine, and he had a bucket of live fish. And he took one out and he put it in his mouth. All of a sudden, his mom, who I think owned the place, looked at him and said, 'What are you doing?' And to my surprise, he pointed at me and went, 'He dared me to!' His mom turns around and is like, 'Did you dare my son to put a live fish in his mouth?' 'No, first of all, if I dared your son to do something, he'd be dead. I wouldn't do a wimpy dare, like read a short story quickly. I'd have a real dare, like eat a bag of fire! Or build a time machine, jerk off in it and send it to Hitler!' That's a dare."
Felipe Esparza,"You know you're getting older when your haters now want to kill you. || The war in Iraq is still going on. The British are helping. Mexico wants to help, but they need a ride over there. || Every week for me was the same audience, and every week they heckled me. The better I got at comedy, the better the audience was at heckling me. But it helped me with my joke writing. || You are not a nerd you're just an asshole with glasses on. || We all have a best friend in here. Every man in here has a best friend. The only reason you hangout with him is because his life sucks more than yours. || The police pulled me over and asked me if I have anything illegal in my car. I looked at my cousin and I ran. || I started drinking when I was like 15, and by the time I was 19 everybody knew I was an alcoholic. So I would start five fights every weekend and lose terribly. First you start off fighting with one person and then he beats you up; and then one guy would be laughing, so you would hit him, too. || I don't know any skinny people who bully fat people. I just know skinny people who use fat people for rides. || Why go to France when you can smell the same people in coffee shops here in America. || A real woman needs quotes by dead men to get through the day. || I know I'm getting older because yesterday I called the police on my neighbors. || I didn’t know how to grab your best material and put it together into a comedy set. I would just choose subjects and do it onstage. That’s what I learned. I didn’t know how to put a set together. || I gotta lose weight. I got stretch marks on my stomach and I never had a baby. So now when I take off my shirt in front of women, I tell them I was attacked by a mountain lion. || I love my dad. He used to walk around the whole neighborhood and collect old furniture and fix it, like MacGyver with duct tape. One time, he brought a television home. I said, 'Damn, that TV has 500 channels.' When I got older, it didn't have 500 channels - it was a knob from the oven. My favorite channel was 300 degrees. || I like to watch French movies with the volume up so my neighbors could think I'm terrorist. || I used to work at UPS I got fired for unloading packages into my car. || Valentines Day is the Super Bowl of  relationships. If you're alone that night  you didn't make the cut. || Wrestling is only gay when you make eye contact. || If the immigration bill doesn't go through it is okay because we'll still go through. || I love my dad. He used to be a professional wrestler in Mexico. So it was cool growing up with him, because when he hit us, he didn’t really hit us. || You write some material, go up on stage and try it out; go back home and throw it in the trash can. And the next day do it again. || I could never have a threesome. This is not a threesome body. This is a turn off the lights body, leave your shirt on body - this is a tell nobody. || Halloween is the only day I can dress up like a hot Latina woman with a beer belly. || If you have a fat brother or sister you might be American. || My mom cooked the same food every day - tortillas, beans and meat. If it was enchiladas, it was - tortillas, beans and meat. If it was burritos, it was still - tortillas, beans and meat. || I got friends who look like life beat the shit out of them. || I envy people who could just have one drink and not go look for cocaine afterwards. || When my ugly friends say shit just got ugly I want to say damn uglier? || We have chemical weapons in America too, they're called meth and cocaine. || That security guard can never tell me where to park. What does he know about parking? He can tell me where to stand. || I got a wedgie coming down from the ceiling in the swing and my leg fell asleep! || I’m not a tough guy, but I can beat up everyone at Trader Joe’s, but at Food-for-Less I shut up. They don‘t have aisles, they have alleys. || I think I'm going to put baby powder all over my legs before this walk just to be safe. || Went to the beach and I bought ceviche and a boogie board from the same person. || I hate when comedians use ""Performed For The Troops"" as one of there credits before they go up on stage. || My dad was one of those dads that would make me stop crying by threatening to beat me. || I was born in Sinaloa, Mexico, along with two of my siblings. The rest were born here in the United States. I didn’t know we were illegal until I was in the 8th grade. We would call other kids wetbacks, but we were the real wetbacks! || Rich people bring a lawyer. Latinos and blacks bring their mom. || I listened to my first comedy album in 6th grade. It was Bill Cosby. My brother and I would play it over and over on a Fisher Price record player. A friend in high school also introduced me to Richard Pryor. I wasn’t writing material back then, but I would say funny stuff. I was good at making fun of people’s moms. If I knew something personal about you, it would be used against you. || Yeah, people ask me about my hair, 'Felipe, what kind of shampoo do you use?' I say, 'I don't know. I think it's called 'SAMPLE, don't take.' || Women look at my brother because he's hot, and they get upset. 'He's gay? What a waste!' I say, 'Hey, I'm not gay.' 'What a shame.' || I better start doing stand up comedy in Spanish before every comedian in Mexico translates my jokes. || Yeah, I still feel like a homie. That connection is still a big thing, 'cause that's where I came from. || I've got three women in my life: my mama, ex baby mama and my new baby mama. || While everyone else was saying Trick or Treat my dad was telling us to say Triki Tras. || Whenever another Latino tells me they're more Mexican than me I stop working and let them do the work for me. || According to my local hip-hop station everyone has garnish wages, child support, liens and wants to buy or rent rims. Ya Heard! || Thanksgiving is the day you don't know if you're invited for dinner or an intervention either way is going to be an ambush. || Cougar jokes are now as hackneyed as airplane food. || I used to sell marijuana to my son’s mom’s new husband. And then I would take that money and give it to her as child support. || I may not be the best dad but I taught my son how to get free samples at the mall. || I also had a stuttering problem. In a Mexican home they don’t give you speech therapy; they don’t even know what speech therapy is. They just get the belt. If there’s a parrot in the house, you better talk better than the parrot."
Flight of the Conchords,"Jen said she'd never ever see me again. When I saw her again, she said it again. || Other rappers diss me. Say my rhymes are sissy. What, what, what, why, why, why? Be more constructive with your feedback. || Bret, you got it goin' on! ""Got it goin' on!"" Not in a gay way but in a hey-your-lookin'-ok-man! || Sometimes love is as sweet as kalbi. || She's so hot. I wanna tell her she's hot, but she'll think I'm sexist. She's so hot, she's making me sexist... bitch. || They're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers. But what's the real cost 'cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper. Why are we paying so much for sneakers when they're made by little slave kids? What are your overheads? || ""You need to work on your people skills."" ""Shut up, Bret."" || I'm not crying, its just been raining... on my face. || It's not till you get out on tour that you realize the impact. || 2 minutes in heaven is better than 1 minute in heaven. || Everyday I look across the office floor, there you were, your hair down to your legs and your legs down the the floor. || These aren't tears of sadness because you're leaving me - I've just been cutting onions. I'm making a lasange... for one. || Do you have one really punky sequinned jump-suit, Bowie, or do you have several ch-ch-changes? || Love is like a roll of tape. It's real good for making two things one, but just like that roll of tape, love sometimes breaks off before you were done. Another way that love is similar to tape, that I've noticed is sometimes it's hard to see the end. You search on the roll with your fingernail. || My rhymes are so potent that in this small segment I made all of the ladies in the area pregnant. Yes, sometimes my lyrics are sexist but you lovely bitches and hos should know I'm trying to correct this. || Making love… making love for… making love for two… making love for two minutes. When you’re with me, girl, you only need two minutes, because I’m so intense. || We really see the live shows as something totally separate from the TV show, even if the audience may not see it that way. || Will somebody get the knife and fork out of my leg, please? Can somebody please remove these cutleries from my knees? || I'm the Hippopotamus, my lyrics are bottomless! || There ain't no party like my nana's tea party. || What man? Which man? Whose the man? When's a man a man? What makes a man a man? Am I a man? yes, technically I am. || My friend just told me he thought I was easily offended. I just can't believe he said that. || And if I am crying, it's not cuz of you, it's because I'm thinking about a friend of mine, who you don't know, who is dying, that's right dying. || No one cares, no one sympathsizes, you just stay home and play synthisizers. || You know when I'm down to my socks it's time for business. That's why they're called business socks. It's business, it's business time. || You're so beautiful. You could be a part time model. But you'd probably still have to keep your normal job. || A kiss is not a contract, but its very nice. Just because you've been exploring my mouth doesn't mean you get to take an expedition for the south. || Boogie, boogie, aw yeah, Robo-Boogie. || ""Yeah my dad was a Women's Rights Activist."" ""Your dad?"" ""Yup."" ""Not your mum?"" ""No... Dad would have never allowed that."" || You’re so beautiful like a tree or a high class prostitute. || Let's get in a cab. I'll buy you a kebab. Now I can't believe I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. With a kebab. || Why can't a heterosexual guy tell a heterosexual guy that he thinks his booty is fly? || Just want to do something special, for all the ladies of the world, and the girls... Carribean... Parisian... Bolivian... Eastern Indochinian... Reptilian... Presbyterian."
Flip Wilson,"Violence is a tool of the ignorant. || The cost of living is going up and the chance of living is going down. || With all the trouble black people have, they try to forget on weekends. You've got to be good to make them laugh. || You can't expect to hit the jackpot if you don't put a few nickels in the machine. || Most drag impersonations are a drag. But everyone can like Geraldine. The secret of my success with Geraldine is that she's not a put-down of women. She's smart, she's trustful, she's loyal, she's sassy. Most drag impersonations are a drag. But women can like Geraldine, men can like Geraldine, everyone can like Geraldine. || My happiest memory of childhood was my first birthday in reform school. This teacher took an interest in me. In fact, he gave me the first birthday presents I ever got: a box of Cracker Jacks and a can of ABC shoe polish. || If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments. || Funny is an attitude. || My show is my statement. What I have to say is on the screen. My life is my own. I don't want to talk about my private self. Why should I? || Things can be funny only when we are in fun. When we're 'dead earnest,' humor is the only thing that is dead. || What you see is what you get. || When you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not. || Funny is not a color. Being black is only good from the time you get from the curtain to the microphone. || It's later than it's ever been. || Get well cards have become so humorous that if you don't get sick you're missing half the fun. || The devil made me do it. || Don't order one for the road, because the road is already laid out. || Being your own man does not mean taking advantage of anyone else. || If I had my entire life to live over, I doubt if I’d have the strength. || It takes 15,000 nuts to hold a car together, but only one to spread it all over the highway. || My main point is to be funny; if I can slip a message in there, fine. || That's a good time to sneak, four in the morning, 'cause anyone you run into, they're sneaking too. || I was number one in the ratings four times last year and twice this season. What could be more damn equal than that? If they get any more equal, I don't want it. || I think Mr. Wilson will have to be the rest of the way alone. || It would be ridiculous for me to say anything negative regarding blacks having an equal opportunity on TV."
Frank Caliendo,"When I used to watch vaudevillian impressionists, people like Rich Little or Frank Gorshin, I always felt like the voice was the only point. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to be of the Robin Williams or Jonathan Winters model, where observation and storytelling was important. || I didn't apply to different schools. I wasn't really sure what I was going to do. || I made the grandkids laugh. John Madden finally liked me! || If it’s just the voice, then you can only do jokes. It’s not really even about the impression so much. It’s about the take and what you do with the person. I try to get a character across with the impression. || I love John Madden because he makes me feel smart. || You know what I would do? I would remake The Wizard of Oz with Robin Williams, and that's it. Just let him do the whole dang thing by himself. || It's a simple and an effective way of getting everyone on the same page, prepared and paying attention to the gag. People just get into that frame of mind of you doing impressions. It can take a minute or two for an audience to catch on when you aren't doing one. || Hey, I work one full hour a day! || Every time Joe Biden says something goofy, I just picture GWBush at home, watching TV saying: “That guy says some dumb stuff.” || Here's a guy that when he puts his contacts in, he can see better. || Remember: Super Bowl is the biggest day of the year for pizza delivery - so no matter what happens in the game, Peyton Manning wins. || I love President Bush. I think it's great we have a president who always looks like he's looking directly into the sun. || Yeah I've been booed before, but I'll be booed again. || Guy on the plane I'm on has a text alert that sounds like a gunshot... And he isn't putting it on vibrate. || Everything is awesome... Everything is cool when you're a part of a team... || Speaking of Quarterback nicknames, you hear they’re calling Jay Cutler 50 cent? Because you only get two quarters out of him. || People expect me to do the classics, and it is a lot like playing a favorite song. || Without Brett Favre, they wouldn’t have Brett Favre, and that’s what that’s all about. || Kim Kardashian is single again. Hey, great. Maybe that will give the NBA players something to do during the lockout. || I was always working, so I would get reading done very late at night a lot of times. || I chose Journalism by default. I always loved TV, and I had no idea what else to do, so I studied what interested me. || I don't do these things to be mean, I do them to make money. || Jay Leno's the only guy on earth who could have a bobble head made of him that would bobble less than his actual head. || I love synonym. That’s my favorite flavor! || I don’t know if you can tell, but I grew up watching a lot of television. || Here’s a guy who when he runs, he goes faster."
Franklyn Ajaye,"You must study their deliveries, their use of their bodies, their timing, and their use of audio and vocal effects. || Don’t try to give a funny opinion; give your opinion in a way that will be funny. || You must not be afraid of small bits of silence. To use it well is the height of confidence and skill for a comedian. It increases the tension in a good way and adds contrast like a curveball complements the fastball of a good pitcher. || Walking back and forth also helps by creating the illusion that you are thinking of the routines on the spot, giving your performance a more spontaneous feeling. || When you take a pause before delivering your punch line, you will be using silence as a creative entity in itself. || Being a professional comedian is doing it right and good, when you don’t feel like it. || A technique I developed quite naturally to help me make smooth transitions was to use a word or phrase from the next routine in the preceding one. || Originality is never embraced as quickly as the commonplace. || If I'm crisp and economical in my delivery, have smooth transitions, movement and animation, and flights of fancy, that would get me an A. || Evaluate every performance on: stage presence, concentration, delivery, material and lessons learned. || Black people drink lots of beer. However, you won't see us skiing down a mountain for one, or see us diving for Frisbees on concrete for one. || This whole urban rap thing needs to be pulled back some. The ghetto is being glorified, and there's nothing good about the ghetto except getting out of one. || Taping yourself and making yourself listen to the tape of each performance no matter how bad is really important.  There's always a nugget line or a direction pointed out to you in even the worst show.  || I think women seem to handle celibacy better. Well, at least when you talk with them, they're very nonchalant about it: 'Oh, no, no, I haven't made love in about three or four months, and I really haven't missed it at all. I've been doing a lot of horseback riding.' || If you do stories, or material with a lot of tags, or afterthought lines, you’ll probably have to cut those out. In other words, you’ll have to strip-mine your material and “lean” it up for time constraints. || I don't like the fact that most black people or black comedians have to present themselves in a flamboyant way. It's good if you can do that, but I don't like to think that's the way all black comedians are. I'm not that type. || Being black and speaking properly are not mutually exclusive. My father was an African, and he spoke beautifully at home. Nelson Mandela speaks beautifully. Should Mandela put his hat on backwards and say, 'Yo, homey, this is Nelson. Yo, Winnie, yo, this is def'? || Obviously the audience has veto power signified by whether they laugh or not, but you-not them-retain the ultimate power to decide what they’re going to get the opportunity to laugh at. || An aspiring comedian must be determined to get to his or her true feelings on a subject and convey that to the audience. Figure out what you’re feeling or interested in because the goal is to get the audience interested in what you’re interested in. Good stand up comedy is drawing people into your head. || I wasn’t able to showcase myself to my satisfaction on television until I did one very important thing: I started treating television as though it were just another night at a club. I stopped ruminating continuously over my television set and thinking about its potential significance. This started with my last few shots with Johnny Carson when I realized why my spots hadn’t seemed as funny to me as my club sets. I realized that the extra thought and preparation actually worked against me. Once I adopted this new attitude, I started doing television spots that I was happy with. But let me stress that this was just my approach. || Bombing teaches you how badly you want to become a comedian. Because unless it’s a burning desire, you’ll quit when the consistent bombing becomes too much to take. || I don't think that comedians have a tradition of trashing the next generation. || It’s better to play to the host as though in a real conversation and let the audience listen in- which they are. || Black cats don’t worry about going bald. We know we don’t have a lot of options, so we adapt to it pretty fast. Black cat will look in the mirror and say, “I’m bald… can’t be pulling no hair from over here and combing it over there… so I just shave this shit off.” White dudes they fight baldness to the death. I know a white guy with one hair, got it swirled all over his head. || I have no desire to be hip to the latest black slang and do the stereotypical black thing. I was a Richard Pryor fan, and I have used profanity in my act. But when it becomes a whole thing that defines blacks, we're limiting ourselves. The enemy is us. || You can’t wait forever for an audience to get the joke, but you should give them at least two seconds to join in before you go on to the next one. || Ideally, you want to be in a fifty-fifty power-sharing arrangement with the audience – both of you are there for a mutually enjoyable experience. || Note the “quality” – not just the quantity – of the laugh that you’re getting. This is just as important – if not more – than just getting laughs. Cheap laughs are just that. Your jokes’ll be treated just like Chinese food. In an hour, people’ll be hungry for another comedian. || In addition to listening to the audience’s laugh, you want to listen to their silence. Is it bored or interested silence? The silence is quieter and filled with energy when they’re interested. You can hear a pin drop. When they’re bored, you can always hear it. || Very few blacks will take up golf until the requirement for plaid pants is dropped. || I advise treating the studio audience like a nightclub audience because that’s the reason you’re doing television – to get them to come see you in a nightclub. || Moving to Australia was not a career move, but a quality of life issue. It has no guns, no God, and no gangster rap. As an Ethiopian cab driver said to me the other day when I was returning from a gig in Sydney, ""Australia is a peaceful, democratic place."" I like the relatively stress free lifestyle. It's worth the drop in income. || When I've mentioned things that I thought only happened to me, or thoughts that I felt had only had crossed my mind, the audience response indicated that they seemed to have happened to, or been thought of by many people. || Doing panel well is actually more important than doing a good stand-up spot because it’s when the audience observes you in a more “conversational” mode and decides if they like your personality – which is one of the real keys to popularity. || When I saw the sign on the freeway that said, ""Los Angeles 445 miles,"" I said to myself, ""I've got to get out of this lane."" || On a good night, I'm just into the flow and seeing the pictures and words in my mind clearly before I say them.  On a bad night, which to be honest are nowhere near as bad as when I was starting out, I just concentrate on performing the routines correctly. I focus on my delivery. || Be prepared to cut your little extra lines that come after a big punchline and move on to the next joke or routine to give your set more punch and crispness. You can keep them in your set, but if the audience applauds your big line, don’t do your tag when it dies down, just move on."
Freddie Prinze,"I don't think I'm a part of my mind that's always working - keeping a record of things that might be funny. || This family was raised Catholic and I think there are still some members of the family who are practising Catholics, while others are recovering Catholics! That, to me, is a real part of America and we wanted to represent that. || I must end it. There is no hope. I will be at peace. No one had anything to do with it. My decision totally. || I never saw Lenny Bruce, but I know all about him. I heard every tape. I’ve talked with his mother. His daughter is like a sister to me. Can you imagine missing someone you never knew? || I grew up in New York in a neighbourhood called Washington Heights. It's not really a ghetto, it's a ghetto suburb. Slums with trees. Even the birds are junkies. The birds don't know how to fly, they just fall out of trees and bother people. ""Tweet, tweet sucker. Give me a quarter."" || L.A. I love it. Everybody’s a superstar. A guy will tell you, ""Yeah, I’m a producer."" And he’s driving a cab."
Gabriel Iglesias,"As far as guys who perform onstage, I love Chris Rock. I'm kind of jaded on everyone else. || ""You've gotten fat!"" ""Well you're fat too!"" ""I know I'm fat! I was fat in high school! I kept my figure, why couldn't you?"" || Some people can handle alcohol. You know who you are. Some people can't handle alcohol. The police know who you are. || Comedians do movies and TV so that when they tour, they sell out. That's the goal: To get popular enough so the place is packed. || You gotta live life before you can talk about it. Sometimes when things don't work out in life, they work out on stage. || What’s the “I” stand for, “I need a bigger bed”? || I don't have to worry about writing jokes. I just tell stories about things that have happened to me. As long as I'm alive and I'm living and I'm experiencing different things every day, the show will always change. || I just know you can not be on top forever. There's always going to be the next guy, and if I'm going to go down, I'd like to know I helped the next guy take my spot. You can't prevent the inevitable, but you can join the ship. || I know what it's like to have a family and not have insurance and really need it. As a comic, insurance was one of those sacrifices I made early on until I could afford it. || Just as I was about to get into my donuts, the cop gets to the window and says the same thing that they all say, right, ""Do you know why I stopped you?"" It was too easy. I looked at him and I said, ""'Cause you can smell it."" || Life is measured by how you lived it, not by the years. || I usually travel with a posse. I roll deep. I travel like a rapper, but without the artillery. We don't carry guns, we carry cookies. || I'm always very happy to talk to people. I relate to people, and the guy on stage is very much the guy that's off stage. People know when it's fake. || I got off the plane - I was walking and cooking at the same time. || I wanted to be a comedian, and this is what I'm doing. If I can keep this going, I'm happy. || I'm a big guy, but I'm really simple with the food. I'll hit the In-N-Out or just the regular buffets. || The Ford Flex is a really, really cool car. You get inside and you have so much headroom and it's really comfortable to drive and it's real techy inside. You look at the screen and it's blue and you've got all kinds of controls. Everything is digital. || I'm all about showing people that I'm a little messed up, I have a lot of the same problems you have. By exposing myself and putting myself out there, people can relate to me and my act won't grow stale. I mean, nobody wants to hear a comedian say, 'Life is great.' || Believe it or not, I've got a really bad metabolism. One burger and I'm done. I'm not a guy that puts away 10 burgers. || I’m not fat. It’s just my awesomeness swelling up inside of me. || I almost bought a DeLorean the other day just because. If I see something that I think is cool and I like it, I'll go for it. || I never go perform somewhere alone. I've done that since day one. I've always taken other comics with me. || You know what I learned about Hawaiians? They're just blown up Mexicans! || I'm not on a diet. And it’s funny cause people go ‘Well, then why do you drink diet soda?’ So I can eat regular cake. || And then I realized I was being checked out by guys! And I know they were checking me out, because they were looking at me like I look at tacos. And I thought to myself, ""Oh my god, I can turn on a man! Shoot!"" And I called my girlfriend, and I said, ""Baby, you better not mess this up; I have options!"" || A lot of the comedians nowadays just do comedy as a stepping stone. Take for example Dane Cook. The guy is huge. The main reason he got into it is to do what he is doing now: film and television work. || It's late and I can't sleep. Bowling it is. || My favorite people to have fun with are police officers 'cause they're so serious, you know. || For the level of entertainment you get for the ticket, it's a solid show. || I don't get controversial, I don't get political and I don't tell you what to do with your life. I just go out there and tell some stories, and people can relate. || Connecting with people is not hard. I love the interaction and the feedback after shows. It does take some time, but the fans appreciate it which makes it worth it. || You wonder why I only talk about my personal life. But that's all I've ever done. || When you leave, you basically want to go eat, because I talk a lot about food in my act. So when you leave, you leave hungry. || I was not the popular kid in school. || I want to get so famous that I don't have to wake up in the morning. It'll probably never happen. || I found that laughter was a form of acceptance, and I really enjoyed that and I just - I crave it. || There’s 5 levels of fatness! Fluffy is one of the levels. There’s big, healthy, husky, fluffy and damn. || I got a brother who calls me Hollywood. Sisters kind of keep their distance. Even my mom is kind of like ahhh with me. Yeah dude, it really sucks. And I wish things were different. Unfortunately, they don't understand everything I go through on a day to day basis to be able to maintain what I'm doing. || When I go to dance clubs, I always dance with big girls, so we finish at the same time. || I'm a comedian who happens to be Latino. What's the difference? The difference is, my special will air on Comedy Central, not Telemundo. || Me racist? The only race I hate is the one you have to run. || In the beginning, when I was doing my shows, I was incorporating a lot of Spanish, just trying to be a Latino comic instead of just a comic. Now I try to make the show as broad as possible... I don't want to alienate people. I want to make it so everybody can follow along and everybody can relate. || Every night, it’s a bakery on the bus. It’s a curse, because I talk about how much I love cake, people bring me cake. And now I just found out I’m diabetic, so I’m like, are you kidding me?! || I keep it very family-friendly. Every now and then I’ll slip a little bit, but that’s just the way I perform. || We can choose our family. We can’t choose our relatives. || I don't wanna die tomorrow knowing that I could have had a piece of chocolate cake tonight. || Why do people measure life by the years instead of how good the years were? || You know, a lot of people think that just cause you work out, lift weights, eat right, and do what people tell you to do that you'll live a long live, maybe you will; but, why do people measure life by the years instead about how good the years were. || Put your life out there and make it entertaining. || And I don’t want you thinking that my girlfriend is a bad person. She is an amazing woman, the fact that I only have seven stories about her in eight years, says a lot. You know, don’t get me wrong, five of them happened this year, but that’s still way below the bar, you know what I am saying. || When you have nothing but big friends, you never get into arguments - except one. And that is, who is the biggest? I'll let you know right now, there's only one way to settle this. We all get in a bus and we go to Disney and we get on a roller coaster - whoever gets the least amount of clicks on the safety bar is the big one. || Home in bed listening to the rain getting ready to order a pizza. Sounds like a song til the last part. || I’m not fat. I’m fluffy! || You live by the cake, you die by the cake. || The worst thing I’m going to do is have dinner without you. || I know enough football to know that’s funny! || Wearing a Hawaiian shirt, you don’t ever come across as offensive. Nobody sees you as a threat. You see someone in a Hawaiian shirt, and you are like ‘this guy is ready to party.’  || Wearing a Hawaiian shirt, you don’t ever come across as offensive. Nobody sees you as a threat. You see someone in a Hawaiian shirt, and you are like ‘this guy is ready to party.’  || Walgreens, Rite Aid, CVS and Wal-Mart have all figured out the evolution of life and they grabbed all the products that are necessary for a life. And they stuck them in one aisle and they put them in order according to how you mess up... First thing you're going to see: condoms. Next to that: lubricant. Next to that: pregnancy test. Next to that: Pampers. Next to that: formula. And at the end of the aisle they sell beer. || Now I understand why people do drugs, why people drink, and why people go crazy. As the success level goes up and up and up, the further detached I get from everybody else. Luckily, with my girlfriend, everything is gravy because I brought her into it. I brought her in and she's very hands on with my career. || I learned early on, stay away from politics, stay away from religion and don't talk about sports. Those three right there will get you in trouble. || You can't be bad ass in a car that kills gas like I kill tacos. || Kids, man, they’re way too honest. They’re like mini-alcoholics. || When I was a kid I did impressions and funny voices a lot. When I was telling a story I would use the voices to make it more entertaining. || And he was offended at my show. Not by anything that I said, but because of the fact that now at the shows I started selling T-shirts and apparently, I didn't have his size. Keep in mind, I go all the way up to five X on the T-shirts and he was like, ""You don't have my size."" I was like, ""Dude, I didn't know they made you! I have up to five X, I don't have X!"" A picture of a dinosaur on the back of the tag, you know? || I get a lot of influence from pro wrestling. People are like, 'Oh, it's fake.' But it's not about whether the guy wins or loses, it's about how he entertains you the whole time you're watching. || My nosey neighbor called the cops on me for making too much noise during football. Is fluffy gonna have to open up a can whop ass? || The only way I will do a sitcom is if it’s hurled at me, and I don’t have to work for it. || I used to say that there were Five Levels of Fatness. Reason why I say ""Used to say"" is because now there are six! Uh-huh, I met the new one in Las Crucas. The original five levels are Big, Healthy, Husky, Fluffy, and Damn! People ask, ""What could be bigger than damn!"" The new level's called ""Oh hell no!"" What's the difference? You're still willing to work with level five. Example, if you're on an elevator and you're with your friend and this really big guy gets on and you and your friend look at each other and you're like, ""damn!"" But you still let the big guy ride your elevator. That's the difference. Level six, you see walking towards your elevator, ""Oh hell no! No! No!"" That's the difference. || I started riding the whole 'fluffy' train, and it's a cute word and socially a lot more acceptable than someone saying is fat or obese. If you call a girl 'fat,' yo, she'll raise hell, but if you say, 'Aw girl, look at you, you're fluffy,' there's almost a sexy appeal to it. || Some comics don't like it when people talk during the set, and it does get a little bit annoying after awhile, but I basically let people dictate what jokes I'm going to do. || I see a Latino comic as someone who can only perform for Latino audiences. I cross the board. || I’m always ready for TV. I don’t have to edit my jokes - when you work clean, you can work anywhere. || I'll walk up to a woman, I'll say the first thing that comes to mind: 'Hey, you hungry?' || That's one thing about my shows. I tell people, I'm not a comedian, I'm just a really funny reporter. I put my life out there and make it entertaining. By putting it out there, it helps me to deal with it, you know, so I don't snap and so I don't go off the handle when I get home. || I had to travel half way across the world to be called an American. || I don't even have a clue as to where to find a pregnancy test. I'm looking at all the aisles... they don't have one that says 'oops.' || Honestly, you got to take care of the people that take care of you. I know that sounds like cliche, or borderline phony, but that's the case. The reason I've had the fans that I have is because I've been consistent over the years and kept coming back and doing the same runs. I'm never going to stop doing the cities I've gone through. I'm only going to add. || When I first got to St. Louis, I saw the arch and I said, ‘I want to go to that McDonalds.' || I have always been told that I was a funny, entertaining person and have always been told to give comedy a try. || Hanging out with comics, all they did was make fun of me. || Comedy is my passion. I'm going to do this until I drop. || Being on TV sucks. It's a lot of work. You memorize scripts and then you show up and they change everything. I'm a control freak. When I'm doing stand-up, I say what I want and then I get instant feedback. || Got an offer to do my next special in 3D. Sounds cool but do you really want me coming into your house? || I'm a big boy, but I can get jiggy with it. Ladies, I will go to dance clubs, and I will tear it up hardcore for a good 30 seconds. || For this being the holiday season everyone at the mall is pissed. Time to shop online. || With all the classes they offer at school, how come they don’t have one for common sense?"
Gallagher,"I found out why God made babies cute. It's so you don't kill them. || See, it's frivolous, superfluous products in America. Like scented toilet paper... is the dumbest thing in the world! The only thing you don't have to make smell good cause it's gonna get fucked up. Who is that smell there to impress? My thumb? If you want to impress my thumb, make it thicker in the middle. || 'I before E except after C?' Americans don't want to learn that! They just sort of make an 'I' looking 'E' and an 'E' looking 'I' then put the dot, right there in the middle! || If your knees bent the other way, what would a chair look like? || If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from? || We go to school to learn to communicate, but all the teachers say to us is ""shut up!"" || If pro is the opposite of con, is progress the opposite of congress? || Why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together? || Why do they call it a TV set when you only get one? || Frankie Valli sings 'Walk Like A Man, Talk Like A Man'... sings it like a woman! || You listen to the world, you'll hear McDonald's say that eatin' there is like a symphony of taste. Yeah, my butt's the wind instrument and the fart's the whole note. || People like crowds. The bigger the crowd, the more people show up. Small crowd, hardly anybody shows up. || Women wear a pair of panties but only one bra. || When yogurt goes bad, how can you tell? || Well, see, babies are born with new eyes. They look at the world with new eyes and you begin to see things, too, through their eyes. I had a problem with her with toilet trainin' and I don't blame her a bit. Cause first I showed her you can't hit your cup on the coffee table. Then I showed her you can't eat on the couch. Then here was this chair you could shit in. || Sledge-O-Matic removes unwanted fingerprints from walls. Sledge-O-Matic also removes unwanted walls from fingerprints. || Why do they call that funny little statue a bust when it stops right before the part of the body that it's named after? || Why isn't phonetic spelled the way it sounds? || Why do they call 'em 'buildings' when they're done building 'em? They ought to be called 'builts.' Or, 'crumblings.' 'I live in that crumbling over there.' || What is dumber than a blind person with a gun? The idiot who handed them the gun. Where do you hide from a blind person with a gun? How do you make a noise that ain't like a rabbit? || What can you say in America? Can I say Priscilla Presley has a big butt? Will I have to prove it in a court of law? Hey, Priscilla, you wanna back it on in here, huh? If she can fit in the witness chair we'll drop, Your Honor. || Why is bra singular and panties plural? || Why are all the home-ec teachers divorced? || Wonder why it is your underarms stink. Did it ever come in handy? Did you ever say ""Well thank God my underarms stunk! He came out of the bushes and I said Get back! I've been to aerobics!"" || What makes Teflon stick to the pan? || Y'know, God experimented with the other animals before he got around to us. You ladies oughtta thank him for creating the cow, and getting that udder idea out of his head! || Do you need a pain reliever that works? Picky shits, ain't ya? || This I before E stuff would've screwed up Einstein. He's got it wrong twice in his name. || Remember this advice...

That's a Coke."" Hog futures; I heard that. Hogs don't have no future. Bacon is not a career. || Living in California is like living in a bowl of granola; what ain't fruits or nuts, is flakes. || If 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the doors? || Why do you need a driver's license to buy liquor when you're not supposed to drink and drive? || Wonder why it is God didn't give us wheels. He must've known we get skates for Christmas. || You know what's stupid? Skiing. You get on top of a slippery mountain with sleds on your feet and you go down... big deal. Try not to. Or, go up! Now that'd be a sport for ya! || I've come here tonight to San Jose, the only city in this nation smart enough to put its airport downtown where nobody cares. || I have to say something about people, even when it's somebody like Michael Jackson. I have to say something about a little dude who runs around the country wearing one glove and singing ""Beat It!"" || I know what people laugh at. I know their vocabulary. || Parents are trying to be friends with their kids rather than draw the line and tell them what proper public behavior would be. || People don't know how to behave in public anymore. || I don't want to overthrow the government. I wanna fire 'em. || I wanna say something about my baby, Aimee. The IRS says I have to; I pay her $20,000 as a writer. || I wish there was a knob on the TV so you could turn up the intelligence. They got one marked ""brightness"" but it don't work, does it? || So they bother you with it, they bother you with it, they bother you with it. Finally you say, ""Gimme the damn present."" You open it up and it's dumb. Lucky for you, now you got a couple days, take it back to the store, get something else, so when your mother comes over she don't see you're still married to an idiot! || I want you to remember, behind every successful man is an amazed mother-in-law. || Wouldn't it be great if people were the same in bed as they are in every day life? When Mark Spitz gets done, does he do a flip off the headboard and come back for another lap? 'Gee, Nadia, that was perfect! That full twisting dismount wasn't bad either, babe!' || I would like now to talk about the Japanese, a race of very short people who are always bending in half. You can't make an honest business deal with them because you can't look em' in the eye. I don't believe any group of people should be able to build a car they can't pronounce. I'm talking of course about the 'Cororra'. || Why do they put the little ""on/off"" words on a light switch? If the light's on, you can see that it's on. If the light's off, it's too dark to see the words on the switch. || Well, let me welcome myself to Texas. Where a man comes home and hangs his hat on his lap. || Hey, what do you expect from a culture that drives on parkways and parks on driveways? || I like church though. Church was a reminder there was something worse than school. || If you water it and it dies, it’s a plant. If you pull it out and it grows back, it’s a weed. || Before the invention of the telephone, you had to lie to people to their face! || I don't know why they say ""you have a baby."" The baby has you. || Why are there interstates in Hawaii? || You know that little indestructible black box that is used on planes... why can't they make the whole plane out of the same material? || Why do they call them cowboys? Cows is girls; bulls is boys. They should call them 'cowgirls' and 'bullboys.' || I know you people, you're the smart ones. You're not the ones going down the freeway with a seatbelt hanging out the door makin' sparks. You're not the ones goin' over the overpass with the turn signal on. Where are they gonna turn? You almost wish they would. || If M & M's melt in your mouth, not in your hand, what would they do, say... under your arms? || I have so much to say when I'm driving and I only have a horn. A horn don't say enough. A horn just goes, ""screeeeeeeew yooooooou!"" Right? I want a microphone. A microphone with a speaker on top, like the cops got. You can have 'em, too. Freedom of speech includes volume. || I have spent my life paying attention to my art form, developing my art form, worrying about my show and what I'm bringing to people, making sure that I give them a fine trade. || Iced tea in the wintertime!

Garry Shandling,"I think I look great in green, and I'm going to start wearing more green. || I think sometimes I should do more carousing, because I don't do much and maybe it would be fun occasionally. It's hard for me to have fun and I'm a serious thinker and a searcher and funny from the front. || I don't know why men are so fascinated with television and I think it has something to do with - if I may judge from my own father, who used to sit and stare at the TV while my mother was speaking to him - I think that's a man's way of tuning out. || My first appearance as a guest on The Tonight Show was in '81. || Yes, I'm a nice man and I enjoy babies. I'm a sensitive guy. I held a baby the other day and it was the first time either of us cried. || Which is, I'm an optimist that two people can be together to work out their conflicts. And that commitment, I think, might be what love is, because they both grow from their relationship. || I have such poor vision I can date anybody. || I'm dating a woman now who, evidently, is unaware of it. || When I'm not in a relationship, I shave one leg, so when I sleep, it feels like I'm with a woman. || My friends tell me I have an intimacy problem. But they don't really know me. || After making love I said to my girl, ""Was it good for you too?"" And she said, I don't think this was good for anybody. || Because I am afraid of commitment. This movie certainly has some bearing and is some reflection of my real feeling about relationships, because I do have commitment issues. My friends tell me I have intimacy problems, but they don't know me, so who cares what they think? || I'm very loyal in relationships. Even when I go out with my mom I don't look at other moms. || I like going into nature and that's where I'm happiest. || I think it's one of the main negative emotional ingredients that fuels show business, because there's so much at stake and the fear of failure looms large. || But I really like hosting, I think it's a strength of mine. It allows me to improvise, and I love the spontaneity of that, and I think I'm funny behind the desk when interviewing someone. || I don't like this reality television, I have to be honest, ... I think real people should not be on television. It's for special people like us, people who have trained and studied to appear to be real. || You know it's funny that none of the regular late-night shows now use guest hosts the way Johnny did. No one talks about it much, but it's curious that they don't do it. They would each have to be asked the reason why they don't. || The only way I would go back to hosting would be if it were something entirely new. It would prevent me from wanting to host a standard-fare kind of talk show. || I'm dating a homeless woman. It was easier talking her into staying over. || I've never had anyone put on a puppet show to convince me of anything. And I've done a lot of stuff. I don't know that I would put the puppets on when I was pitching a show. This was the head of the studio putting a puppet show on. And I'll tell you, he wasn't bad. || First of all, I'm not the kind of guy that likes to rehash the show and so forth and so on. || Here's the thing - I'm single, I haven't been married, I don't have kids yet. If I do have kids I would be interested to see them in my life, so here's a movie for kids and I'm in there and I'm supposed to be kind of funny for kids. || I am pretty tenacious as a perfectionist in terms of getting something right. || I don't know how to ground myself without the other actor present. || I guess he wanted to see a little more sexual activity because in real life, in bed I think less is more and let the woman come to me. Frankly, I don't even need a woman there. || I once made love for an hour and fifteen minutes, but it was the night the clocks are set ahead. || What planet are you from? || Without comedy as a defence mechanism I wouldn't be able to survive. || I'm good in bed, actually, and I think I could learn to be a good communicator, too. The only trouble with that is it leads to marriage. || Rip as we know is vastly experienced and funnier than I think anyone knew. The show really reveals him to be a brilliant comedic actor. || It's not the hair on your head that matters. It's the kind of hair you have inside. || I'm not a party guy. I don't carouse very much. || I actually think I'm more of a turtle than Verne is. Where Verne is up on two legs and moving at full speed and doesn't pull his head into the shell very often, I in reality was five or ten minutes later to every recording session. || Women need to know that not all guys are going to hurt them the way that the guy did before they started dating me. I know guys I wouldn't go out with. || I sold my house this week. I got a pretty good price for it, but it made my landlord mad as hell. || I went to my doctor and told him, ""My penis is burning."" He said, ""That means somebody is talking about it."" || Carol Burnett was particularly funny. She swore for the first time on television on Larry Sanders. || I play basketball on Sundays and I'm a very spiritual guy; I read a lot of Eastern philosophy and I meditate. || I don't know how to ground myself without the other actor present. || I practice safe sex - I use an airbag. || The comic strip is what I looked at, and it's another reason I did it. The comic strip, where animals would comment on human behaviour, interested me. || I told my girl friend that unless she expressed her feelings and told me what she liked I wouldn't be able to please her, so she said, ""Get off me."" || I'm too shy to express my sexual needs except over the phone to people I don't know."
Gary Gulman,"I really think I'm at the top of my game right now, and I have the tools that I've learned over the years, so I feel really good about what I'm doing onstage now. || I think of a lot of comedy being watched alone, for some reason. It’s surprising to me that people are getting together to watch stand-up comedy. || No matter what time of year it's always funny when a person walks by me dressed in religious garb and I say Happy Halloween! || I have 236 movies on my queue and I feel like I should always be watching movies. Like if I wake up in the middle of the night and don't fall directly back to sleep, I'm like, 'I've been up for an hour and a half I could have watched 'Toy Story 3' by now.' In this economy it is a sin not to be watching movies when you have Netflix. || I was born when my dad was 50… It’s weird growing up with a dad that much older than you. We’d go to the movies, we’re both getting discounts. || Some people hate Jews. Fine, alright it's been done. I mean, that's part of my problem with it. Could you hate somebody new? I'm not giving you any suggestions but the Belgians have had a good run. || The key is to get it all down on paper before the coffee stops telling you you’re talented. || I sometimes throw in a couple of swears just to keep the Christian right off my tail. I wouldn’t want to be the tea party’s go-to comedian. ||  I do jokes about the specific guys in the steroids scandal. I feel bad for the guys who did steroids and still suck. || I always wanted to make strangers and friends and family laugh. I was over ten years younger than my brothers. It was hard to get attention without some kind of gimmick, like athletic stardom or being funny. || The pill, now that's a good invention, just for the fact that everybody here knows exactly which pill I'm talking about. I gave you ""the"" and a very vague noun and everybody's onboard! || Is the word brunette used anywhere outside of porn anymore? || It was early on when I was really focused and obsessed with doing The Tonight Show and Letterman and stuff like that. Then, I quickly realized that those things don’t make or break a career. || I hate nickels; they're quarter impersonators. || A cookie without sugar is a cracker. || If you try to pop the unpopped kernels in the microwave, you go back in time. || I did all those other jobs very poorly and half-heartedly really just to pay the bills while I went after this comedy dream. || Don't go back over your life with a red pen. || Maybe a silver lining to growing old is being able to watch Usual Suspects for the first time, again. || Would it be ironic if we had to go back to Iraq to rid it of the Al Quaeda that wasn't there before we got there to rid it of Al Queda? || Are you allowed to smoke eCigarettes without arrogance? || Nobody ever celebrates the ""Why me?!"" God blaming terminally ill. We should, if only for the contrast they provide. || Rich people are just like us though they now eat their meals off square shaped plates. || Without my family, I'd be something. || Do you know what Bill Gates has to pull out of an old coat, to feel like I did with a $20 bill? First of all, the idea that Bill Gates has an old coat is preposterous. If he has an old coat, it's the coat Abe Lincoln was shot in and he wears it as a bathrobe - no underwear by the way. He lets his billionaire balls swing willy-nilly beneath the death cloak of the great emancipator. That's your 1%. || Where can I find a Big Bird t-shirt, a disco ball and a 14-inch dildo? Spencer’s Gifts. || I don’t know, maybe it’ll change as I get older, but I have always enjoyed my birthday and the liberty it allows me. No matter what I do, I can say, “Well, it’s my birthday. It’s my birthday.” It’s sort of like diplomatic immunity with my family. || It’s a real valley when I talk about veal. And calf roping. People were sensitive about calf roping. Which I think is quite funny. || I’ve always wanted to do more significant stuff. I think of myself as well-informed, but the hardest thing to do is talk about politics and current events and be funny and not just preachy. || I really shine in front of prominently Jewish crowds. Normally I really beat myself up, but as far as Jewish audiences go, I’m at the top of my game. || Night to night, doing the clubs is a lot of fun too because you have a lot more freedom and you don't have to worry about swearing or going off the script or going long or going short. If you bomb, only a handful of people see it. On TV, a lot of people see it. || I think everything contributes to your creativity. || Oreo, have you been reading my diary? Because this has been a fantasy of mine for some time. || If you are 26 years old and you’re waking up under Star Wars sheets… the Force is not with you. || We invented Saturdays off. Enjoy, you're welcome. || No, yea. You were ahead of me, until you went shopping… the best I can offer you is back cutsies, and that’s incredibly generous. || I think everything is fair game to a certain extent. || The other thing is that I’m a pretty moody guy, but no one really wants to see a normal-looking guy complain about things or talk about being unhappy. That’s hard. Most people are like, ‘Well, you have all your hair and you’re tall, so why are you unhappy?’ That can be limiting. || In all seriousness, do rappers really speak to the women in their life like that? || Is it common for people to become a pothead at 40? Asking for myself. || Please tell me that the Crossfit Cult members have a suicide pact. || Why shouldn't we air grievances at funerals? || The definition of the word ""nerd"" has changed. It's now any attractive person with a hobby. The loneliness component is no longer included. || For the first few years I wrote jokes and performed them word for word and then wrote tags for them and did that word for word and that worked pretty well. Now, I do almost all of my writing on stage and then record and listen for any new things and then I write those down. || There are certain jokes that indicate how mainstream a comic is. If you’re talking about how the side effects of drugs that they advertise on TV are worse than the actual illness they’re supposed to prevent, that’s like the hackiest joke out there now. If you’re still doing that joke, that usually is an indicator of being mainstream, in a bad way. || Ever drive by one of those things on the highway which tells you how fast you’re going? I don’t even pay attention to them anymore because I found a similar gadget in my dashboard… Some people slow down at those things… I don’t slow down. I speed up and set the high score. || When you're gay every party is a bad sweater party. || I was at my parents' house all day - because I live there. || What I need is an Urban Thesaurus. I know what ""money"" is what I need is 600 different ways to say it. || With basketball, if a guy is having an off night you still can say he’s a good athlete. But with a comedian, you see them in front of the wrong audience - and they can look like complete amateurs. It’s remarkable. || There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow more precious than a pot of gold. || I just always wonder if I’m too obsessive about subjects. I try to avoid that. || Just saw an orthodox Jewish kid do 3 pull-ups on the scaffolding. Shattering the previous record. || The popcorn button on the microwave is a miraculous invention.  More miraculous than even the microwave itself. || As a child I most closely identified with Charlie Browns teacher. Nobody listened. || The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was the quarter from behind the ear gag. He would never put the time in. || Comedians: We're allowed to not have a podcast right? || So drug dealers don't find it funny when you ask for a receipt? || Say what you will about Gypsy women, but they are remarkable assessors of blues guitar talent. || I think the biggest challenge I have faced is that I have struggled most of my life with often crippling depression which has sometimes if not keeping me off stage kept me from writing regularly and with any kind of confidence. || I went to Boston College. It's a Catholic college, yeah I had a nickname there: Jew. || I just can't dance like no ones watching. I tried but it's futile."
George Burns,"It takes only one drink to get me drunk. The trouble is, I can't remember if it's the thirteenth or the fourteenth. || In those days the best painkiller was ice; it wasn't addictive and it was particularly effective if you poured some whiskey over it. || Sex at age 90 is like trying to shoot pool with a rope. || If you stay in the business long enough and get to be old enough, you get to be new again. || Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city. || Love is a lot like a backache, it doesn't show up on X-rays, but you know it's there. || Fall in love with what you do for a living. I don't care what it is. It works. || In what other business can a guy my age drink martinis, smoke cigars and sing? I think all people who retire ought to go into show business. I've been retired all my life. || And God said: 'Let there be Satan, so people don't blame everything on me. And let there be lawyers, so people don't blame everything on Satan.' || I like women to be attracted to me. See, when you get 60 years old, and they know you're 60, the only women you can get are 55-year-old women, and I like younger women. || Everything that goes up must come down. But there comes a time when not everything that's down can come up. || I drink coffee with my right hand, and I smoke with my left. But I talk with both hands. || Be quick to learn and wise to know. || How beautifully leaves grow old. How full of light and color are their last days. || Retire? I'm going to stay in show business until I'm the only one left. || When Jack Benny has a party, you not only bring your own scotch, you bring your own rocks. || Bridge is a game that separates the men from the boys. It also separates husbands and wives. || Old age is when you resent the swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated because there are fewer articles to read. || Smartness runs in my family. When I went to school I was so smart my teacher was in my class for five years. || I'm going to stay in show business until I'm the last one left. || We had asked Jack Benny to give the bride away, but Jack said he never gave anything away. || I'd rather be over the hill than under it. || The secret of a good sermon is to have a good beginning and a good ending, then having the two as close together as possible. || I'd announce that I was going to sing, and all our guests would make a ring around the piano. But somehow I managed to fight my way through the ring and sing anyway. || At home we ate fish every Friday, as Catholics were then supposed to do. Being Jewish, I compromised. I wore a hat when I ate fish, out of respect for my own religion and the fish's family. || There are many ways to die in bed, but the best way is not alone. || A young mind in a healthy body is a wonderful thing. Especially for an old man with an open night. || I get a standing ovation just standing. || Well, anybody can be a straight man if he hears well. You just have to wait for laughs. A straight man just repeats the questions and the comedian gets the laughs and you just wait for them and don't let them die completely at the tail end of the laugh. || Take care not to wear stripes that are out of sync with your wrinkles. || I should have been a country-western singer. After all, I'm older than most western countries. || What actresses do today when they appear on the screen is what they did once upon a time for getting to appear on the screen. || Nudity has taken over all of show business. I went into a nightclub last week and a beautiful young girl came out onto the stage with nothing on and sang ""On a clear day you can see forever."" || There is nothing wrong with making love with the light on. Just make sure the car door is closed. || First you forget names, then you forget faces. Next you forget to pull your zipper up and finally, you forget to pull it down. || Age to me means nothing. I can't get old; I'm working. I was old when I was twenty-one and out of work. As long as you're working, you stay young. When I'm in front of an audience, all that love and vitality sweeps over me and I forget my age. || People ask me what I'd most appreciate getting for my 87 birthday. I tell them a paternity suit. || Define your business goals clearly so that others can see them as you do. || It's one of the old show business axioms. No matter how successful you've been, there's always a younger and sexier seal coming along. || It isn't premarital sex if you have no intention of getting married. || By the time you're eighty years old you've learned everything. You only have to remember it. || When I was young I was called a rugged individualist. When I was in my fifties I was considered eccentric. Here I am doing and saying the same things I did then and I'm labeled senile. || I was always taught to respect my elders and I've now reached the age when I don't have anybody to respect. || Don't stay in bed, unless you can make money in bed. || I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate. || Yale men do not like to be told anything by people who didn't go to Yale. The closest I came to Yale was once I had one of their padlocks. || When we played the back end of a horse we always knew that if we worked hard and did a good job we could become the front end. || At my age, the only thing hot waiting for me in my dressing room is a bowl of soup. || When you stop giving and offering something to the rest of the world, it's time to turn out the lights. || I lie a lot, but when I write about Gracie, I don't have to lie. The truth is unbelievable enough. || Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. Goodness, remembrance and love have no end. || When I was in Vegas women were throwing their hotel keys at me. But it was after they checked out. || I spent a year in that town, one Sunday. || I look to the future because that's where I'm going to spend the rest of my life. || Life's but a day at most. || Nice to be here? At my age it's nice to be anywhere. || I can remember when the air was clean and sex was dirty. || If you live to be one hundred, you've got it made. Very few people die past that age. || If you ask what is the single most important key to longevity, I would have to say it is avoiding worry, stress and tension. And if you didn't ask me, I'd still have to say it. || You know you're getting old when you stoop to tie your shoelaces and wonder what else you could do while you're down there. || There will always be a battle between the sexes because men and women want different things. Men want women and women want men. || Everyday happiness means getting up in the morning, and you can't wait to finish your breakfast. You can't wait to do your exercises. You can't wait to put on your clothes. You can't wait to get out - and you can't wait to come home, because the soup is hot. || Retirement at sixty-five is ridiculous. When I was sixty-five I still had pimples. || If I paid $3 or $4 for a cigar, first I'd sleep with it. || Young. Old. Just Words. || Happiness? A good cigar, a good meal, a good cigar and a good woman - or a bad woman; it depends on how much happiness you can handle. || I smoke ten to fifteen cigars a day. At my age I have to hold on to something. || You can't help getting older, but you don't have to get old. || Acting is all about honesty. If you can fake that, you've got it made. || When I was a boy the Dead Sea was only sick. || Too bad all the people who know how to run this country are busy running taxicabs or cutting hair. || I can't understand why I flunked American history. When I was a kid there was so little of it. || I would go out with women my age, but there are no women my age. || I can't afford to die; I'd lose too much money. || Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman who’ll give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you're in the wrong house. || I look better, feel better, make love better and I'll tell you something else... I never lied better. || Our record doesn't show it, but we are getting better. || If I get big laughs, I'm a comedian. If I get little laughs, I'm a humorist. If I get no laughs, I'm a singer. || People are always asking me when I'm going to retire. Why should I? I've got it two ways - I'm still making movies, and I'm a senior citizen, so I can see myself at half price. || I was married by a judge - I should have asked for a jury. || There are two kinds of cruises - pleasure and with children. || For thirty years my act consisted of one joke... and then she died. || I thought to myself, 'why not write a bestseller?' In the first place, more people buy them and more people read them. You make more money and it doesn’t take any more time to write a bestseller than it does to write a book nobody buys. || ""Money is the root of all evil."" Then we hear, ""A fool and his money are soon parted."" What are they talking about? If money is so evil, shouldn't it be, ""A wise man and his money are soon parted""? And another thing, how does a fool get money in the first place? I know some fools who have a lot of money, but they won't tell me how they got it, and I won't tell them. || I don't worry about getting old. I'm old already. Only young people worry about getting old. || Being an actor is easy, just picture someone in a room and you outside waiting for your cue to go in. Elliot Gould's been trying that for forty years. || This is the sixth book I've written, which isn't bad for a guy who's only read two. || If it's a good script I'll do it. And if it's a bad script, and they pay me enough, I'll do it. || With the collapse of vaudeville new talent has no place to stink. || Sex can be fun after eighty, after ninety, and after lunch! || I'm at the age now where just putting my cigar in its holder is a thrill. || I don't believe in dying. It's been done. I'm working on a new exit. Besides, I can't die now - I'm booked. || Dress simply. If you wear a dinner jacket, don't wear anything else on it... like lunch or dinner. || At my age flowers scare me. || First of all you've got to have talent. And then you've got to marry her like I did. || I love to sing, and I love to drink scotch. Most people would rather hear me drink scotch. || If you were married to Marilyn Monroe, you'd cheat with some ugly girl. || Be sure to wear a good cologne, a nice aftershave lotion, and a strong underarm deodorant. And it might be a good idea to wear some clothes, too. || Someone who makes you laugh is a comedian. Someone who makes you think and then laugh is a humorist. || Sex is one of the nine reasons for reincarnation. The other eight are unimportant. || I've been a straight man for so many years that from force of habit I repeat everything. I went out fishing with a fellow the other day and he fell overboard. He yelled, ""Help! Help! Help!"" so I said, ""Help? Help? Help?"" And while I was waiting for him to get his laugh, he drowned. || I did go to school - my kind of school. When I was a kid I went out ... and you meet people. You talk to them. Anybody says something that makes sense, it stays with you, rubs off on you. That kind of school. || I use the cigar for timing purposes. If I tell a joke, I smoke as long as they laugh and when they stop laughing I take the cigar out of my mouth and start my next joke. || No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible."
George Carlin,"Writing books isn’t a drastic departure from writing for the stage. || Baseball is the only major sport that appears backward in a mirror. || I was once dancing with a woman who told me she had a yeast infection so I told her to bake me some bread. || Sometimes a fireman will go to great strenuous lengths to save a raccoon that’s stuck in a drainpipe and then go out on the weekend and kill several of them for amusement. || I hate Dr Phil. Dr Phil told me to express my feelings, so I'm expressing them. || I’ve never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of Gatorade. || Somehow I enjoy watching people suffer. || This is a country where tobacco kills four hundred thousand people a year, so they ban artificial sweeteners! Because a rat died! You know what I mean? || The reason I talk to myself is that I'm the only one whose answers I accept. || One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor. || Just cause you got the monkey off your back doesn't mean the circus has left town. || Ever notice that anyone going slower than you is an idiot, but anyone going faster is a maniac? || Twat is twat and that is that. || Not all children are smart and clever, got that? Kids are like any other group of people: a few winners... a whole lot of losers. || I never eat sushi. I have trouble eating things that are merely unconscious. || If a painting can be forged well enough to fool experts, why is the original so valuable? || It isn’t fair: the caterpillar does all the work, and the butterfly gets all the glory. || Most people with low self-esteem have earned it. || Pride should be reserved for something you achieve or obtain on your own, not something that happens by accident of birth. Being Irish isn't a skill... it's a fucking genetic accident. You wouldn't say I'm proud to be 5'11""; I'm proud to have a pre-disposition for colon cancer. || Religion has what is easily the greatest bullshit story of all time. || I'm happy to tell you there is very little in this world that I believe in. || It was my uncle who taught me about the birds and the bees. He sat me down one day and said, ""Remember this, George, the birds fuck the bees."" Then he told me he once banged a girl so hard her freckles came off. || When evolution is outlawed, only outlaws will evolve. || There are women named Faith, Hope, Joy, and Prudence. Why not Despair, Guilt, Rage, and Grief? It seems only right. ""Tom, I'd like you to meet the girl of my dreams, Tragedy."" These days, Trajedi. || I don't like to think of laws as rules you have to follow, but more as suggestions. || Fighting for peace is like screwing for virginity. || Comedy is a socially acceptable form of hostility and aggression. That is what comics do, stand the world upside down. || Kilometers are shorter than miles. Save gas, take your next trip in kilometers. || ""I am"" is reportedly the shortest sentence in the English language. Could it be that ""I do"" is the longest sentence? || Fuck all the people who say, ""God bless,"" and then don't bother to complete the sentence. Who they are, I haven't the slightest. But, if I were God, I would not honor such a request. || When you're born you get a ticket to the freak show. When you're born in America, you get a front row seat. || George Washington’s brother, Lawrence, was the Uncle of Our Country. || A good motto to live by: ""Always try not to get killed."" || No matter how you care to define it, I do not identify with the local group. Planet, species, race, nation, state, religion, party, union, club, association, neighborhood improvement committee; I have no interest in any of it. I love and treasure individuals as I meet them, I loathe and despise the groups they identify with and belong to. || I love and treasure individuals as I meet them; I loathe and despise the groups they identify with and belong to. || The real reason that we can’t have the Ten Commandments in a courthouse: You cannot post “Thou shalt not steal,” “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” and “Thou shalt not lie” in a building full of lawyers, judges, and politicians. It creates a hostile work environment. || If it requires a uniform, it’s a worthless endeavor. || Religion has convinced people that there’s an invisible man... living in the sky, who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he doesn’t want you to do. And if you do any of these things, he will send you to a special place, of burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever, and suffer and burn and scream until the end of time. But he loves you. He loves you and he needs money. || When cheese gets its picture taken, what does it say? || Leadership camp? Isn't that where Hitler went? || They keep saying you can't compare apples and oranges. I can. An apple is red and distinctly non-spherical; an orange is orange and nearly spherical. So, what's the big problem? || If you think there's a solution, you're part of the problem. || “When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?” This title offends all three major religions, and even vegetarians!  || The best thing about living at the water’s edge: You only have assholes on three sides of you, and if they come this way you can hear them splash. || Hey! Time for a few fart jokes! Where would a comedy show be without a few fart jokes? || Sometimes a little brain damage can help. || No one knows what’s next, but everybody does it. || Conservatives want live babies so they can train them to be dead soldiers. || Bullshit is truly the American soundtrack. || There are nights when the wolves are silent and only the moon howls. || Everyone smiles in the same language. || I wanted to get a job as a gynecologist, but I couldn't find an opening. || I can remember staring at the orphanage and feeling envy. || Picture your grandmother in Hell, baking pies... without an oven. || Life.....is a series of dogs. || Keep thy religion to thyself. || By and large, language is a tool for concealing the truth. || A house is just a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get more stuff. || Here’s a bumper sticker I’d like to see: “We are the proud parents of a child who’s self-esteem is sufficient that he doesn’t need us promoting his minor scholastic achievements on the back of our car.” || What year did Jesus think it was? || If a man smiles all the time, he’s probably selling something that doesn’t work. || If you try to fail, and succeed, which have you done? || Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day. || I think the warning labels on alcoholic beverages are too bland. They should be more vivid. Here is one I would suggest: ""Alcohol will turn you into the same asshole your father was."" || It's important in life if you don't give a shit. It can help you a lot. || Sports fans eat shit. || Why do they put Braille on the drive-through bank machines? || A cat will blink when struck with a hammer. || Why don't sheep shrink when it rains? || I don't think we should be governing ourselves. What need is a king, and every now and then if the king’s not doing a good job, we kill him. || Life is tough, then you die. || If man evolved from monkeys and apes, why do we still have monkeys and apes? || Why are a ""wise man"" and a ""wiseguy"" opposites? || Why do ""overlook"" and ""oversee"" mean opposite things? || Suppose you took an oath by placing your right hand on the Bible and raising your left? Would it still count? Does God really give a shit? Does anyone? || I don’t have pet peeves - I have major psychotic fucking hatreds! || Why is it called ""after dark"" when it really is ""after light""?  || What was the best thing before sliced bread? || I do this real moron thing, and it's called thinking. And apparently I'm not a very good American because I like to form my own opinions. || Religion is like a pair of shoes... Find one that fits for you, but don't make me wear your shoes. || I believe you can joke about anything. || Why keep trotting out this Billy Graham character? He has nothing to say and basically no one gives a fuck. || The IQ and the life expectancy of the average American recently passed each other going in opposite directions. || There are 400,000 words in the English language, and there are seven you can’t say on television. What a ratio that is! 399,993 to 7. They must really be bad. They must be outrageous to be separated from a group that large. “All of you words over here, you seven... bad words.” That’s what they told us, right? You know the seven, don’t ya? That you can’t say on TV? Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. || The next time a prostitute solicits your business, ask for the clergyman’s rate. || Make-believe cowboys. Closest they've ever gotten to a cow is when they stopped to take a piss at an Arby's. || Put two things together which have never been put together before, and some schmuck will buy it. || If the Cincinnati Reds were really the first major league baseball team, who did they play? || I'm always relieved when someone is delivering a eulogy and I realize I'm listening to it. || You have to be realistic about terrorism. Certain groups of people, certain groups, Muslim fundamentalists, Christian fundamentalists, Jewish fundamentalists, and just plain guys from Montana, are going to continue to make life in this country very interesting for a long, long time. || ""One thing leads to another""? Not always. Sometimes one thing leads to the same thing. Ask an addict. || Jesus died for our sins. Dare we make his sacrifice meaningless by not committing them? || I like Florida. Everything is in the 80's. The temperatures, the ages and the IQ's. || A lady came up to me on the street, pointed at my suede jacket and said, ""Don’t you know a cow was murdered for that jacket?"" I said ""I didn’t know there were any witnesses. Now I’ll have to kill you too"".  || Y'ever notice how you never seem to get laid on Thanksgiving? I think it's because all the coats are on the bed. || I never joined the Boy Scouts. I don’t trust any organization that has a handbook. || We will never be an advanced civilization as long as rain showers can delay the launching of a space rocket. || I couldn't commit suicide if my life depended on it. || Did you ever look at your watch, and you look away... and you don't know what time it is? || How is it possible to have a civil war? || Ask people why they have deer heads on their walls and they tell you it’s because they’re such beautiful animals. I think my wife is beautiful, but I only have photographs of her on the wall. || If you spin an oriental man in a circle three times, does he become disoriented? || You show me something that doesn't cause cancer, and I'll show you something that isn't on the market yet. || Whoever coined the term “Buyer Beware” was probably bleeding from the asshole. || We get what we deserve. They are our elected officials. || I was a loner as a child. I had an imaginary friend - I didn't bother with him. || Do you think Sammy Davis ate Junior Mints? || If you live long enough, sooner or later everybody you know has cancer. || The truth is Pavlov's dog trained Pavlov to ring his bell just before the dog salivated. || You never see a smiling runner. || Do infants enjoy infancy as much as adults enjoy adultery? || I've always wanted to be somebody, but I should have been more specific. || The upper class: keeps all of the money, pays none of the taxes. The middle class: pays all of the taxes, does all of the work. The poor are there... just to scare the shit out of the middle class. || Most people are not particularly good at anything. || Spirituality: the last refuge of a failed human. Just another way of distracting you from who you really are. || Do you know the nicest thing about looking at pictures of a 1950’s baseball park? The only people wearing baseball caps are the players. || They debated NAFTA for a long time: should we sign it or not? Either way the people get fucked. Trade always exists for the traders. Anytime you hear businessmen debating “which policy is better for America,” - don’t bend over. || Is it true that cannibals don't eat clowns because they taste funny? || When you stress individualism, as this country does; materialism, as this country does; personal weaponry, as this country does; and racial hatred, which is part of our heritage as white Europeans; and then you add the volatile ingredient of nothing. || A lot of times when they catch a guy who killed twenty-seven people, they say, ""He was a loner."" Well, of course he was a loner; he killed everyone he came in contact with.  || The day after tomorrow is the third day of the rest of your life. || History is not happenstance: it is conspiratorial. Carefully planned and executed by people in power. || In today's America, no child ever loses. There are no losers anymore. Everyone's a winner. No matter what the game or sport or competition, everybody wins. Everybody wins, everybody gets a trophy, no one is a loser. No child these days ever gets to hear those all-important, character building words: ""You lost, Bobby! You lost, you're a loser, Bobby!"" They miss out on that. You know what they tell a kid who lost these days? ""You were the last winner."" A lot of these kids never get to hear the truth about themselves until they're in their twenties. When their boss calls them in and says ""Bobby, clean the shit out of your desk and get the fuck out of here, you're a loser."" || Some national parks have long waiting lists for camping reservations. When you have to wait a year to sleep next to a tree, something is wrong. || I’m in shape. Round is a shape. || Help me find some shoes I really like. Help me also to find a nymphomaniac coke connection who owns a Ferrari dealership. || The following statement is true. The previous statement is false. || Is a vegetarian permitted to eat animal crackers? || People say life begins at conception, I say life began about a billion years ago and it's a continuous process. || The reason they call it the American Dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it. || Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things. || If Helen Keller had psychic ability, would you say she had a fourth sense? || Running isn't a sport because anyone can do it. Anything we can all do can't be a sport. I can run, you can run. My mother can run, you don't see her on the cover of Sports Illustrated do you? || The future will soon be a thing of the past. || You know who I pray to? Joe Pesci. Two reasons: First of all, I think he's a good actor, okay? To me, that counts. Second, he looks like a guy who can get things done. Joe Pesci doesn't fuck around. In fact, Joe Pesci came through on a couple of things that God was having trouble with. || If it’s true that we are here to help others, then what exactly are the others here for? || The planet is fine. The people are fucked. || Why is it called tourist season if we can't shoot at them? || If all the world is a stage, where is the audience sitting? || I like it when a flower or a little tuft of grass grows through a crack in the concrete. It's so fucking heroic. || When I hear a person talking about political solutions, I know I am not listening to a serious person. || The status quo sucks. || Religion is just mind control. || Not only do I not know what's going on, I wouldn't know what to do about it if I did. || Sore loser? You bet your fucking ass! What on earth is wrong with being a sore loser? It shows you cared about whatever the contest was in the first place. Fuck losing graciously - that's for chumps. And losers, by the way. || If churches want to play the game of politics, let them pay admission like everyone else. || If a man is standing in the middle of the forest speaking and there is no woman around to hear him... is he still wrong? || How do they get the deer to cross at that yellow road sign? || Shopping and buying and getting and having comprise the Great American Addiction. No one is immune. When the underclass riots in this country they don’t kill policemen and politicians, they steal merchandise. How embarrassing. || It’s way beyond ironic that a place called the Holy Land is the location of the fiercest most deeply felt hatred in the world. || If we could just find out who's in charge, we could kill him. || May the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house. || Children are not our future, and I can prove it with my usual, flawless logic. Children can't be our future, because by the time the future arrives, they won't be children anymore, so blow me! || I think it would be interesting if old people got anti-Alzheimer's disease where they slowly began to recover other people's lost memories. || Where does the dentist go when he leaves the room? || Don't confuse my point of view with cynicism. The real cynics are the ones who tell you that everything's gonna be all right. || If you want to get rid of counterfeit money, put it in the collection plate at church. || Next time they give you all that civic bullshit about voting, keep in mind that Hitler was elected in a full, free democratic election. || If a parsley farmer is sued, can they garnish his wages? || When someone is impatient and says, ""I haven't got all day,"" I always wonder, how can that be? How can you not have all day? || What if there were no hypothetical questions? || I knew a transsexual guy whose only ambition is to eat, drink, and be Mary. || The Golden Gate Bridge should have a long bungee cord for people who aren’t quite ready to commit suicide but want to get in a little practice. || People love to admit they have bad handwriting or that they can't do math. And they will readily admit to being awkward: ""I'm such a klutz!"" But they will never admit to having a poor sense of humor or being a bad driver. || The safest place to be during an earthquake would be in a stationary store. || The child molester skipped breakfast, but said he'd grab a little something on the way to work. || I’m a high-tech low-life. A cutting edge, state-of-the-art bi-coastal multi-tasker and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond! || Where do forest rangers go to ""get away from it all?"" || If people stand in a circle long enough, they'll eventually begin to dance. || Those who dance are considered insane by those who cannot hear the music. || Some people have no idea what they're doing, and a lot of them are really good at it. || So, have a little fun. Soon enough you'll be dead and burning in Hell with the rest of your family. || My mother would say, ""Why are you always playing alone?"" And I would say, ""I'm not playing, Ma. I'm fucking serious!"" || The worst thing about e-mail is that you can’t interrupt the other person. You have to read the whole thing and then e-mail them back, pointing out all their mistakes and faulty assumptions. It’s frustrating and it’s time-consuming. God bless phone calls. || Of course, in Los Angeles, everything is based on driving, even the killings. In New York, most people don't have cars, so if you want to kill a person, you have to take the subway to their house. And sometimes on the way, the train is delayed and you get impatient, so you have to kill someone on the subway. That's why there are so many subway murders; no one has a car. || Conservatives say if you don't give the rich more money, they will lose their incentive to invest. As for the poor, they tell us they've lost all incentive because we've given them too much money. || So I do have this ambivalence. Obviously I'm against militaries, because of what militaries do. In many ways though, the air force was unmilitary-like. They dropped bombs on people, but... they had a golf course. || When it comes to God's existence, I'm not an atheist and I'm not agnostic. I'm an acrostic. The whole thing puzzles me. || To be intoxicated is to feel sophisticated, but not be able to say it. || People who see life as anything more than pure entertainment are missing the point. || Never let the brain idle. ""An idle mind is the devil’s workshop."" And the devil’s name is Alzheimer’s. || I have six locks on my door, all in a row. When I go out, I lock every other one. I figure no matter how long somebody stands there picking the locks, they are always locking three of them. || God bless the homicidal maniacs. They make life worthwhile. || If the black box flight recorder is never damaged during a plane crash, why isn’t the whole airplane made out of that stuff? || Isn't it a bit unnerving that doctors call what they do ""practice?"" || Atheism is a non-prophet organization. || I never fucked a ten, but one night, I fucked five twos. || I think people should be allowed to do anything they want. We haven't tried that for a while. Maybe this time it'll work. || I call him Governor Bush because that's the only political office he's ever held legally in this country. I don't care where they hang his portrait, I don't care how big his library is. To me, he'll always be ""Governor Bush."" I don't even capitalize his name when I type it anymore. || Have you ever noticed that their stuff is shit and your shit is stuff? || Who would have thought that the manufacturing of sticks would be outsourced to China? || Well, if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight? They never mention that part to us, do they? || Regarding the fitness craze: America has lost its soul; now it's trying to save its body. || A lot of these people who keep a gun at home for safety are the same ones who refuse to wear a seat belt. || After every horror we’re told, “Now the healing can begin.” No. There’s no healing – just a short pause before the next horror. || Where ideas are concerned, America can be counted on doing one of two things: take a good idea and run it completely into the ground, or take a bad idea and run it completely into the ground. || I'm not into working out. My philosophy is no pain, no pain. || Before they give you a lethal injection, they swab your arm with alcohol. It's true. Well, they don't want you to get an infection, and you can see their point. They don't want some guy go to hell and be sick. || The mayfly lives only one day. And sometimes it rains. || What a curse it must be being a bisexual. Can you imagine wanting to fuck everybody you meet?! || Soft rock music isn’t rock, and it ain’t music. It’s just soft. || It's nothing but a big stroke job in this country. The government strokes you every day of your life. Religion never stops stroking you. Big business gives you a good stroke. And it's one big, transcontinental, cross-country, red, white and blue stroke job... Do you know what the national emblem for this country ought to be? Forget that bald eagle. The national emblem of this country ought to be Uncle Sam standing naked at attention saluting, and seated on a chair next to him, the Statue of Liberty jerking him off. That would be a good symbol for the United Strokes of America. || There are no bad words. Bad thoughts. Bad intentions, and words. || You know the best thing about necrophilia? You don't have to bring flowers. Yeah... Usually, they're already there. || I think I am, therefore, I am. I think. || I’m a visionary; I’m ahead of my time. Trouble is, I’m only about an hour and a half ahead. || May the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house. || Irony deals with opposites; it has nothing to do with coincidence. || Death is caused by swallowing small amounts of saliva over a long period of time. || Electricity is really just organized lightning. || I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people who believe it. || Don Ho can sign autographs 3.4 times faster than Efrem Zimbalist Jr. || It's all bullshit, folks and it's bad for ya. || California is a small woman saying, ""Fuck me."" New York is a large man saying, ""Fuck you!"" || She was only a prostitute, but she had the nicest face I ever came across. || If the #2 pencil is the most popular, why is it still #2? || A guy say to me ""are you gay?"" and I say ""bend over and let's find out"". || Eventually, alas, I realized the main purpose of buying cocaine is to run out of it. || Boy, am I glad to get rid of that fucking Mother Teresa. || If you’re reading it in a book, folks, it ain’t self-help. It’s help. || Why is the man (or woman) who invests all your money called a broker? || When someone asks you, a penny for your thoughts, and you put your two cents in, what happens to the other penny? || I'm completely in favor of the separation of Church and State. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death. || Honesty may be the best policy, but it's important to remember that apparently, by elimination, dishonesty is the second-best policy. || Have you noticed that most of the women who are against abortion are women you wouldn’t want to fuck in the first place? There’s such balance in nature. || Reminds me of something my third-grade teacher said to us. She said, “You show me a tropical fruit and I’ll show you a cocksucker from Guatemala.” || You remember my neighbor with the burns on 90 percent of her body? Well, she burned the other 10 percent now. She was lighting a fart and her bush caught fire! || When I first heard the song ""Don’t worry - be happy"" I realized it was exactly the kind of mindless philosophy that Americans would respond to. It would make a great national anthem along with ""Me first"". || Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience. || Bowling is not a sport because you have to rent the shoes. || I put a dollar in a change machine. Nothing changed. || People who say they don't care what people think are usually desperate to have people think they don't care what people think. || When I see a large group of people, I wonder how many of them will eventually require autopsies. || Suppose I could shoot myself in the mouth, but what if I miss? People will laugh at me. || President George Bush declared a National Day of Prayer for Peace. This was after he had carefully arranged and started the war. || I worry about my judgment when anything I believe in or do regularly begins to be accepted by the American public. || If you ate pasta and anti-pasta, would you still be hungry? || Age is a very high price to pay for maturity. || One nice thing about egotists: they don't talk about other people. || Women like silent men, they think they're listening. || And off we go, out onto the highway looking for a little fun. Perhaps a flatbed truck loaded with human cadavers will explode in front of a Star Trek reunion. One can only dream and hope. || Fuck rational thought. || In most polls there are always about 5 percent of the people who ""don't know."" What isn't generally understood is that it's the same people in every poll. || I was a hip kid. When I saw Bambi it was the midnight show. || Because we were a poor area, the school had a small budget and was unable to teach the second half of the alphabet. || When you step on the brakes your life is in your foot's hands. || The mai tai got its name when two Polynesian alcoholics got in a fight over some neckwear. || I've never owned a telescope, but it's something I'm thinking of looking into. || Although the photographer and the art thief were close friends, neither had ever taken the other's picture. || A flag is supposed to represent everything that a country does. It doesn't only represent the good things. If you burn the flag, you're burning the flag for what you perceive to be the bad things the country has done. It's only a symbol. It's only a piece of cloth. || You can’t argue with a good blowjob. || Little-known fact: When the stock exchange closes, the guy who comes out on the balcony with that big hammer slams it on the head of the person who lost the most money that day. || I'm in favor of personal growth as long as it doesn't include malignant tumors. || I went straight from shenanigans to cries against humanity. || Weather forecast for tonight: dark. Continued dark overnight, with widely scattered light by morning. || You know how you speed up baseball? Everybody gets one swing. That's it one swing fuck you, you're out sit down! || Whose cruel idea was it for the word ""lisp"" to have an ""s"" in it? || If this is the best God can do, I'm not impressed. || I don't have hobbies; hobbies cost money. Interests are quite free. || The other night I ate at a real nice family restaurant. Every table had an argument going. || Just when I discovered the meaning of life, they changed it. || Life is a zero sum game. || Isn’t making a smoking section in a restaurant like making a peeing section in a swimming pool? || You show me a lazy prick who's lying in bed all day, watching TV, only occasionally getting up to piss, and I'll show you a guy who's not causing any trouble. || They don't want an educated populace capable of critical thought, sitting around the kitchen table realizing how badly they're getting fucked! || Granola didn’t sell very well when it was good for you. Now it has caramel, chocolate, marshmallow, saturated fat and sweeteners with a small amount of oats and grains. Sales picked up. || Christian deodorant: ""Thou shalt not smell."" || In Rome, the emperor sat in a special part of the Coliseum called the Caesarian Section. || Why is there so much controversy about drug testing? I know plenty of guys who would be willing to test any drug they could come up with. || Singing is basically a form of pleasant, controlled screaming. || I don't have any beliefs or allegiances. I don't believe in this country, I don't believe in religion, or a god, and I don't believe in all these man-made institutional ideas. || As it stands right now, I lead Richard Pryor in heart attacks, two to one. However, Richard still leads me, one to nothing, in burning yourself up. || If someone with multiple personalities threatens to kill himself, is it considered a hostage situation? || Catholic - which I was until I reached the age of reason. || I think it's the duty of the comedian to find out where the line is drawn and cross it deliberately. || Inside every cynical person, there is a disappointed idealist. || Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away. || Frisbeetarianism is the belief that when you die, your soul goes up on the roof and gets stuck. || I have lots of ideas. Trouble is, most of them suck. || How can He be perfect? Everything He ever makes... dies. || If the police arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to remain silent? || When I ask how old your toddler is, I don't need to hear '27 months.' 'He's two' will do just fine. He's not a cheese. And I didn't really care in the first place. || As a matter of principle, I never attend the first annual anything. || Always do whatever's next. || I was thinking about how people seem to read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older; then it dawned on me - they're cramming for their final exam. || One can never know for sure what a deserted area looks like. || You know the good part about all those executions in Texas? Fewer Texans. || If you’ve got a cat and a leg, you’ve got a happy cat. If you’ve got a cat and two legs, you’ve got a party. || ""No comment"" is a comment. || Trying to be happy by accumulating possessions is like trying to satisfy hunger by taping sandwiches all over your body. || He - and if there is a God, I am convinced he is a he, because no woman could or would ever fuck things up this badly. || Most of the time people feel okay. Probably it’s because at the moment they’re not actually dying. || Instead of warning pregnant women not to drink, I think female alcoholics ought to be told not to fuck. || Hooray for most things! || The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A Death! What’s that, a bonus? I think the life cycle is all backwards. You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you live in an old age home. You get kicked out when you’re too young, you get a gold watch, you go to work. You work forty years until you’re young enough to enjoy your retirement. You do drugs, alcohol, you party, you get ready for high school. You go to grade school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little baby, you go back into the womb, you spend your last nine months floating... and you finish off as an orgasm. || If the cops didn’t see it, I didn’t do it! || Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that. || It turned out I was pretty good in science. But again, because of the small budget, in science class we couldn't afford to do experiments in order to prove theories. We just believed everything. Actually, I think that class was called Religion. Religion class was always an easy class. All you had to do was suspend the logic and reasoning you were being taught in all the other classes. || They say that instead of cursing the darkness, one should light a candle. Nothing is mentioned, though, about cursing a lack of candles. || Leave my friend alone officer he's legally drunk. || What wine goes with Captain Crunch? || I'm not concerned about all hell breaking loose, but that a part of hell will break loose... it'll be much harder to detect. || There's no present. There's only the immediate future and the recent past. || I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, ""Where's the self-help section?"" She said if she told me, it would defeat the purpose. || The main reason Santa is so jolly is because he knows where all the bad girls live. || What does it mean to pre-board? Do you get on before you get on? || Once you leave the womb, conservatives don’t care about you until you reach military age. Then you’re just what they’re looking for. Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers. || Boxing is a more sophisticated form of hockey. || Men are from Earth, women are from Earth. Deal with it. || Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. || Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups. || Oh Beautiful for smoggy skies, insecticided grain,for strip-mined mountain's majesty above the asphalt plain. America, America, man sheds his waste on thee, and hides the pines with billboard signs, from sea to oily sea. || There are only two places in the world: over here and over there. || Why is the alphabet in that order? Is it because of that song? || Ever notice when you blow in a dog’s face he gets mad at you, but when you take him in a car he sticks his head out the window? || Everyone should try to scratch their name on the bomb of life. || You're really spread out now, you've got stuff all over the world! You've got stuff at home, stuff in storage, stuff in Honolulu, stuff in Maui, stuff in your pockets... supply lines are getting longer and harder to maintain. || I don't have to tell you it goes without saying there are some things better left unsaid. I think that speaks for itself. The less said about it the better. || I am a personal optimist but a skeptic about all else. What may sound to some like anger is really nothing more than sympathetic contempt. I view my species with a combination of wonder and pity, and I root for its destruction. And please don't confuse my point of view with cynicism; the real cynics are the ones who tell you everything's gonna be all right. || You can’t fight City Hall, but you can goddamn sure blow it up. || Some people see the glass half full. Others see it half empty. I see a glass that's twice as big as it needs to be. || We use up words like ""spiritual"" so fast in this culture. Twenty years ago ""spiritual"" had a distinct meaning. But now there's a lot of jack-off thinkers who just love to talk about the spiritual. And there is a lot of bogus - is ""bogosity"" a word? It should be - a lot of bogosity in these spiritual seekers. So you have to find another way to express it. I just call it ""how I fit"". || I don’t understand the problem with paroling Charles Manson? I say set him free and let him get on with his work. I have a long list of celebrities I’d be glad to share with him. || Cloud nine gets all the publicity, but cloud eight actually is cheaper, less crowded, and has a better view. || Can’t we silence these Christian athletes who thank Jesus whenever they win and never mention his name when they lose? You never hear them say, ""Jesus made me drop the ball"" or, ""The Lord tripped me up behind the line of scrimmage."" || One out of every three Americans is suffering from some form of mental illness. Think of two of your best friends. If they are OK, then it must be you. || If everything that ever lived is dead, and everything that's alive is gonna die, where does the sacred part come in? || You ever notice that? Any time you see two groups of people who really hate each other, chances are good they're wearing different kind of hats. Keep an eye on that, it might be important. || When you visualize the recent past, do you see it as being somewhere over on the left? || What exactly is ""viewer discretion""? If viewers had discretion, most television shows would not be on the air. || Some people have no idea what they're doing, and a lot of them are really good at it. || Never raise your hands to your kids. It leaves your groin unprotected. || It's legal for men to be floorwalkers and illegal for women to be streetwalkers. || I'm not a person who thinks they can have it all, but I certainly feel that with a bit of effort and guile I should be able to have more than my fair share. || I went through the usual stages: imp, rascal, scalawag, whippersnapper. And, of course, after that it's just a small step to full-blown sociopath. || I often warn people: somewhere along the way, someone is going to tell you, ""There is no ""I"" in team."" What you should tell them is, ""Maybe not. But there is an ""I"" in independence, individuality and integrity."" || I do something about the weather. I stay home. || Hard work is a misleading term. Physical effort and long hours do not constitute hard work. Hard work is when someone pays you to do something you'd rather not be doing. Anytime you'd rather be doing something other than the thing you're doing, you're doing hard work. || Every time you use the phrase all my life it has a different meaning. || When you think about it, attention-deficit order makes a lot of sense. In this country there isn’t a lot worth paying attention to. || When I was a kid, if a guy got killed in a western movie I always wondered who got his horse. || When I got out of high school they retired my jersey, but it was for hygiene and sanitary reasons. || A lot of times when a package says Open Other End, I purposely open the end where it says that. || Scientists announced today that they have discovered a cure for apathy. However, they claim no one has shown the slightest interest in it. || Whever you see the word cuisine used instead of the word food, be prepared to pay an additional eighty percent. || If someone loves you and they leave and don't come back, it was never meant to be. If someone loves you and they leave and come back, set them on fire. || As far as I’m concerned, humans have not yet come up with a belief that’s worth believing. || If a piece requires some specific inflection, I'll record it. I take a lot of notes, and later categorize them, combining them alongside existing ideas, and eventually put a piece together. || At a formal dinner party, the person nearest death should always be seated closest to the bathroom. || So I say, “Live and let live.” That’s my motto. “Live and let live.” Anyone who can’t go along with that, take him outside and shoot the motherfucker. It’s a simple philosophy, but it’s always worked in our family. || Have you ever noticed that the lawyer always smiles more than the client? || Capitalism tries for a delicate balance: it attempts to work things out so that everyone gets just enough stuff to keep them from getting violent and trying to take other people’s stuff. || We are a nation of sheep, and someone else owns the grass. || Reminds me of something my grandfather would say. He'd say, ""I'm going upstairs to fuck your grandmother."" He was an honest man, and he wasn't going to bullshit a four-year-old. || There's a humorous side to every situation. The challenge is to find it. || Is there another word for synonym? || I have this real moron thing I do? It's called thinking. || If God had intended us not to masturbate he would've made our arms shorter. || Everything beeps now. || They say rather than cursing the darkness, one should light a candle. They don't mention anything about cursing a lack of candles. || There are battered husbands. Apparently this happens when the woman is real big, the man is very small, and they each drink a quart of whiskey a day. || More people write poetry than read it. || Rights aren't rights if someone can take them away. They're privileges. That's all we've ever had in this country, is a bill of temporary privileges. And if you read the news even badly, you know that every year the list gets shorter and shorter. || I really haven't seen this many people in one place since they took the group photographs of all the criminals and lawbreakers in the Ronald Reagan Administration. || People get all upset about torture, but when you get right down to it, it’s really a pretty good way of finding out something a person doesn’t want you to know. || You have to stay in shape. My mother started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She's 97 now and we have no idea where she is. || I have certain rules I live by. My first rule: I don't believe anything the government tells me. || Life is a near-death experience. || I’m always relieved when someone is delivering a eulogy and I realize I’m listening to it. || Dusting is a good example of the futility of trying to put things right. As soon as you dust, the fact of your next dusting has already been established. || I finally accepted Jesus - not as my personal savior, but as a man I intend to borrow money from. || I tried to believe that there is a God, who created each of us in His own image and likeness, loves us very much, and keeps a close eye on things. I really tried to believe that, but I gotta tell you, the longer you live, the more you look around, the more you realize, something is fucked up. || I figured out years ago that the human species is totally fucked and has been for a long time. I also know that the sick, media-consumer culture in America continues to make this so-called problem worse. But the trick, folks, is not to give a fuck. Like me. I really don't care. I stopped worrying about all this temporal bullshit a long time ago. It's meaningless. || People can't seem to get it through their heads that there is never any healing or closure. Ever. There is only a short pause before the next ""horrifying"" event. People forget there is such a thing as memory, and that when a wound ""heals"" it leaves a permanent scar that never goes away, but merely fades a little. What really ought to be said after one of these so-called tragedies is, ""Let the scarring begin."" || The Christians gave Him Sunday, the Jews gave Him Saturday, and the Muslims gave Him Friday. God has a three-day weekend. || Not only do I not know what's going on, I wouldn't know what to do about it if I did. || When you think about it, attention-deficit order makes a lot of sense. In this country there isn’t a lot worth paying attention to. || Just think, right now as you read this, some guy somewhere is gettin’ ready to hang himself. || I’m always relieved when someone is delivering a eulogy and I realize I’m listening to it. || I think everyone should treat one another in a Christian manner. I will not, however, be responsible for the consequences. || Have you ever wondered why Republicans are so interested in encouraging people to volunteer in their communities? It’s because volunteers work for no pay. Republicans have been trying to get people to work for no pay for a long time. || You know an odd feeling? Sitting on the toilet eating a chocolate candy bar. || When you step on the brakes your life is in your foot's hands. || If you can't beat them, arrange to have them beaten. || The very existence of flame-throwers proves that some time, somewhere, someone said to themselves, you know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done. || Some people see things that are and ask, why? Some people dream of things that never were and ask, why not? Some people have to go to work and don't have time for all that.  || I would never want to be a member of a group whose symbol was a guy nailed to two pieces of wood. || Dusting is a good example of the futility of trying to put things right. As soon as you dust, the fact of your next dusting has already been established. || I thought about how mothers feed their babies with tiny little spoons and forks so I wondered, what do Chinese mothers use? Toothpicks? || If it's true that our species is alone in the universe, then I'd have to say that the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little. || I, myself, have killed six people. All random, all undetected, no way to trace them to me. And, let me tell you, there's nothin' like it. It's a great feeling. Yeah, I know, you're thinking. ""Aw, he's a comedian. He's just sayin' that stuff."" Good. That's exactly what I want you to think. || I'm not a person who thinks they can have it all, but I certainly feel that with a bit of effort and guile I should be able to have more than my fair share. || Don't confuse me with those who cling to hope. I enjoy describing how things are, I have no interest in how they ""ought to be"". And I certainly have no interest in fixing them. I sincerely believe that if you think there's a solution, you're part of the problem. My motto: Fuck Hope! || Pardon me I've got nothing to say. || A man came up to me on the street and said I used to be messed up out of my mind on drugs but now I'm messed up out of my mind on Jeeesus Chriiist. || Who decides when the applause should die down? It seems like it's a group decision; everyone begins to say to themselves at the same time, ""Well, okay, that's enough of that."" || Why don’t network TV shows have a warning that says ""Caution: you are about to watch a real piece of shit."" || I’m thinking of buying a church and changing it around: maybe selling crack and having a few whores in the pew. || As far as I’m concerned, humans have not come up with a belief that’s worth believing. || Dogs and cats get put to sleep; hogs and cows get slaughtered. || If work is so terrific, how come they have to pay you to do it? || If one synchronized swimmer drowns, do the rest have to drown too? || If no one knows when a person is going to die, how can we say he died prematurely? || Why do croutons come in airtight packages? It's just stale bread to begin with. || There are ten thousand people in the United States in a persistent vegetative state. Just enough to start a small town. Think of them as veggie-burghers. || A woman told me her child was autistic, and I thought she said artistic. So I said, ""Oh great. I'd like to see some of the things he's done."" || I love it in a movie when they throw a guy off a cliff. I love it even when it's not a movie. No, especially when it's not a movie. || I didn't wash today. I wasn't dirty. If I'm not dirty, I don't wash. Some weeks I don't have to shower at all. I just groom my three basic areas: teeth, hair, and asshole. And to save time, I use the same brush. || I went through the usual stages: imp, rascal, scalawag, whippersnapper. And, of course, after that it's just a small step to full-blown sociopath. || It is said that Indians were sometimes named for the first thing they saw when they were born. Makes you wonder why there aren't more Indians named Hairy Pussy, doesn't it? || Always do whatever's next || And here's something else, another problem you might have: Suppose your prayers aren't answered. What do you say? ""Well, it's God's will."" ""Thy Will Be Done."" Fine, but if it's God's will, and He's going to do what He wants to anyway, why the fuck bother praying in the first place? Seems like a big waste of time to me! Couldn't you just skip the praying part and go right to His Will? It's all very confusing. || And although I broke a lot of laws as a teenager, I straightened out immediately upon turning eighteen, when I realized the state had a legal right to execute me. || Don't give your money to the church. They should be giving their money to you. || The older you get, the better you realize you were. || Heart disease has changed my eating habits, but I still cook bacon for the smell. || I'm kinda like herpes, I just keep coming back. || Political discourse has been reduced to ""Where's the beef?"" ""Read my lips,"" and ""Make my day."" Where are the assassins when we really need them? || In comic strips, the person on the left always speaks first. || I wanna live. I don’t wanna die. That’s the whole meaning of life: not dying! I figured that shit out by myself in the third grade. || You know who would make an interesting murder-suicide? Madeline Albright and Yanni. || If acting was hard for me, I wouldn`t do it, it is something that I like to do. || I used to be Irish Catholic.

Try spelling Evian backward. || If 4 out of 5 people suffer from diarrhea... does that mean that 1 enjoys it? || If your kid needs a role model and you ain't it, you're both fucked. || Tits always look better in a pink sweater. || When Ronal Reagan got Alzheimer’s disease, how could they tell? || Never forget that Hitler was a Catholic. || I have nothing against the planet per se. I root for the big comet or asteroid as a way of cleansing the planet. The comet or asteroid 65 million years ago is probably what gave us our opening to replace the reptiles. || Baseball is a nineteenth-century pastoral game. Football is a twentieth-century technological struggle. || There will be a rain dance Friday night, weather permitting. || In America, anyone can become president.

That’s just common sense! || One good reason to only maintain a small circle of friends is that three out of four murders are committed by people who know the victim. || They show you how detergents take out bloodstains. I think if you’ve got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe your laundry isn’t your biggest problem. || What exactly is ""midair""? Is there some other part of air besides the ""mid"" part? || The Baby Boomers: whiny, narcissistic, self-indulgent people with a simple philosophy: ""Gimme that! It's mine!"" || And now, in the interest of equal time, here is a message from the National Institute of Pancakes: It reads, and I quote, “Fuck waffles.” || I'm thinking of opening up a motel and calling it ""The Sleep and Fuck"". Wouldn't that be a good, honest name for a motel, who needs this ""Shady Pines""-bullshit? ""The Sleep and Fuck""-motel. Get me one of them big neon signs: ""Sleep"", ""Fuck"", ""Sleep"", ""Fuck"". || I'm desperately trying to figure out why Kamikaze pilots wore helmets. || What about Goblins, huh? Doesn't anybody believe in Goblins? You never hear about this. Except on Halloween and then it's all negative shit. And what about Zombies? You never hear from Zombies! That's the trouble with Zombies, they're unreliable! I say if you're going to go for the Angel bullshit you might as well go for the Zombie package as well. || As soon as someone is identified as an unsung hero, he no longer is. || ""I'm keeping him in my thoughts."" Where? Where exactly in your thoughts does he fit? In between ""my ass hurts in this chair"" and ""let's fuck the waitress""? || If all our national holidays were observed on Wednesdays, we could wind up with nine-day weekends. || Property is theft. Nobody “owns” anything. When you die, it all stays here. || Why do they lock gas station bathrooms? Are they afraid someone will clean them? || You can prick your finger - just don’t finger your prick. || Most people work just hard enough not to get fired and get paid just enough money not to quit. || Avoid teams at all cost. Keep your circle small. Never join a group that has a name. || The phrase surgical strike might be more acceptable if it were common practice to perform surgery with high explosives. || The sicker you get, the harder it is to remember if you took your medicine. || Do pediatricians play miniature golf on Wednesdays? || We now buy watches primarily for their looks, price, or additional functions. The fact that they tell time seems lost. || Do you remember Barbara Bush? I call her the silver douchebag. || I don't understand why prostitution is illegal. Selling is legal, fucking is legal. So why isn't it legal to sell fucking? || There are no innocent fucking victims. If you live on this planet you're guilty - period - Fuck you - End of report - Next case. || Why do we park on driveways and drive on parkways? Just to be silly! || You ever notice the first thing someone says when they can't find something is that it was stolen? They say ""who stole it?!"". It's an ego defense. They can't stand the fact that they might have been stupid enough to have lost something. || All music is the blues. All of it. || My grandfather, mother and father were gifted verbally, and my mother passed that along to me. She always made sure I was conscious of language and words. || I don't have a fear of heights. I do, however, have a fear of falling from heights. || So far, this is the oldest I’ve been. || The only good thing ever to come out of religion was the music. || No one who has had “Taps” played for them has ever been able to hear it. || One great thing about getting old is that you can get out of all sorts of social obligations just by saying you’re too tired. || If a movie is described as a romantic comedy, you can usually find me next door playing pinball. || When Thomas Edison worked late into the night on the electric light, he had to do it by gas lamp or candle. I'm sure it made the work seem that much more urgent. || Think off-center. || Standing ovations have become far too commonplace. What we need are ovations where the audience members all punch and kick one another. || I recently went to a new doctor and noticed he was located in something called the Professional Building. I felt better right away. || The very existence of flamethrowers proves that some time, somewhere, someone said to themselves, ""You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done."" || It's never just a game when you're winning. || If lawyers are disbarred and clergymen defrocked, doesn't it follow that electricians can be delighted, musicians denoted? || Standing ovations have become far too commonplace. What we need are ovations where the audience members all punch and kick one another. || I remember when I was a kid I used to come home from Sunday School and my mother would get drunk and try to make pancakes. || You get to play with people's little danger zones. || I grew up in New York wanting to be like those funny men in the movies and on the radio. || I was taken to the hospital for observation. I stayed several days, didn't observe anything, and I left. || People tell you to have a safe trip, as if you have some control over it. || Here's all you have to know about men and women: women are crazy, men are stupid. And the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid. || Life gets really simple once you cut out all the bull shit they teach you in school. || How come when it’s us, it’s an abortion, and when it’s a chicken, it’s an omelette? || People always tell me ""Have a nice day."" Well what if I don't want to? What if I want to have a crappy day? || I recently bought a book of free verse. For twelve dollars. || Without the laughs, the audience wouldn’t be there at all, so in that sense, yes, I am a comedian. || Excuse me, officer, but would you mind bringing the wreckage a little closer this way? My wife can't see. || If two baseball players from the same hometown, on different teams, receive the same uniform number, it is not ironic. It is a coincidence. If Barry Bonds attains lifetime statistics identical to his father's, it will not be ironic. It will be a coincidence. || We created god in our own image and likeness! || Instead of school busing and prayer in schools, which are both controversial, why not a joint solution? Prayer in buses. Just drive these kids around all day and let them pray their fuckng empty little heads off. || America: where Irish, English, Germans, Scandinavians, Poles and Italians come together to kill Indians, lynch niggers and beat the shit out of spics and Jews. || If a turtle doesn't have a shell, is he homeless or naked? || If a mute swears, does his mother wash his hands with soap? || Regarding local residents attempting to ban sex shops from their neighborhoods: you show me a parent who says he's worried about his child's innocence and I'll show you a homeowner trying to maintain equity. || These days many politicians are demanding change. Just like homeless people. || You know what I do? I steal things. Fuck 'em! I grab a handful of candy bars and six magazines and head for the gate. || So I want to thank the Pentagon, the Soviet Union and the military-industrial complex from the bottom of my heart. Without them, I could never have become the man I am today. || I'll bet there aren't too many people hooked on crack who can play the bagpipes. || If a pig loses its voice, is it disgruntled? || I don't believe there's any problem in this country, no matter how tough it is, that Americans, when they roll up their sleeves, can't completely ignore. || If everyone in the world sat quietly at the same time, closed their eyes and concentrated as hard as they could on peace and goodwill, all the killing and cruelty in the world would continue. And probably increase. || Let a smile be your umbrella, and you'll end up with a face full of rain. || Would a fly without wings be called a walk? || Procrastination is the art of keeping up with yesterday."
George Lopez,"One time, I was so hungry, I ate the beans in a bean bag chair. || From now on, we`re home schooling you. Whatever we don`t know, you don`t know. When did the Korean War start? I don`t know, and neither do you! || David Letterman is the best late-night talk show host right now, hands down, and has been since he first took the desk. || It's a great day in America when white people, black people and Latinos can all come together and pick on another minority. || Marijuana brownies are amazing. Very simple to make, too. Just get some Duncan Hines brownie mix and cook the weed right in there. Drop it right in with the butter. I don’t know who came up with this idea first, but it’s sheer genius. || We speak English and Spanish at the same time.  “Ay, que cute.” || I think we all feel the same things most of the time, we just don't know how to put it into words. When I'm on stage, I say it. The truth makes people laugh. || Barack Obama may be black, but John McCain is the first Albino presidential candidate: he's completely see-through! || When we got married, we agreed on a boy for me, and a girl for you. Mine's upstairs sleeping. Good luck with yours! || The stupidest thing is to assume Latinos are all from Mexico. “What part of Mexico are your ancestors from?” Los Angeles, bitch! || Look, I made a commitment to corn 17 years ago. Sure, I'm a man. I like to go to a barbecue and see beans that I like: baked beans, red beans, black beans, big plump garbanzos. But in the end, I always come home to my sweet, sweet corn. || Just yesterday, you were my little girl on a tricycle. Now, you are a young woman in a car, running over a little girl on a tricycle. || We're Mexican not Mexican't! || I think there could be a way where it can be allowed, regulated, taxed and looked at as a positive for California in a place where we’re giving out IOU’s, baby! || I don't like the fact that people think Latinos wont vote for an African-American. It's bullshit. Were going to vote for the right person who can restore faith and hope in this country. Latinos feel disenfranchised. Obama's dream is our dream. || The guy is like Honduran-German. Why would you pretend to be Mexican? I think he had that intention from the beginning that he was going to play Mexican. || My grandmother instilled in me a toughness that comes with survival. She was a tough lady and never truly enjoyed her life. She would always worry about things and I would tell her that it wasn’t going to get her anywhere and it didn’t. I wasn’t even that smart back then, but I knew that worrying about everyone else wasn’t good for her health. As Latinos, we stress and worry so much about the future when the future is today. As long as we protect what’s good in our lives, we will be all right. || Y'know, if those pews reclined and the priests gave the Raiders scores, I'd go to church every Sunday. || Chicanos never say congratulations when people do well. “I got a job over at the hospital.” “‘S about time.” Do we say good luck? No, we say, “Don’t fuck it up like last time.” Or, “So now you think you’re all bad, or what?” Go to the Hallmark store and look for that card. “Do you have a Now-You-Think-You’re-All-Bad card?” || Angie, I've seen my mom wrestle two cops to the ground with a taser dart in her neck, and you cry when your shoes pinch. Good luck, Bambi! || Sarah Palin is Latina. Pay-leen. She has an infant and a grandkid the same age. Latina! || If you had a personal trainer, you would probably eat him. I know that in every fat person, there's a skinny person inside, but you could have all the season's contestants of America's Next Top Model in you. I hope I get reincarnated as your feet. That way, you'd never see my face again... Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have insulted you. Because in my country, cows are sacred. || When things are bad, it's the best time to reinvent yourself. || Dammit, I can never do nothing! || I believe that there are certain things that could be taken care of that you don't need a strong political background in. || Whoever is my relative, I will not be nice to them. || The putts break toward the diamond lane on the freeway here. I had a putt break toward a call box, so I know it depends on what lane. I missed a two-footer because a guy was changing his tire in my line. || We are now the proud owners of a white boy. Now we have to shop in the caucasian isle and get sunscreen, mayonaise and mild salsa because the other ones really hawt! || And really almost like every TV star who loses his job. Now what am I going to do, everybody asks. What am I going to do now? Like every TV star before I’m going to find some crack. I’m going to get on the pipe. Lose that unwanted 110 pounds I’ve been trying to lose. || 80% of the women who were asked if they fake orgasms said yes. Actually, they said ""Yes! Oh God, Yes!"" || We have so many people in the camp that it's difficult for everybody to find a porta-potty. With 90,000 people at a game, you can imagine 10,000 standing in line. || Two wrongs do not make a right; but three rights make a left. || Shows should just be able to be shows without hyphenating their lead characters. || I actually graze at several of the homes while I'm playing. There a lot of food going on. I drink and eat and use the restrooms in a lot of the houses. What better way to really get closer to the fans than to steal their soap from the restrooms as they allow you to enter their homes? || It means a lot in that I always felt invisible, and I was louder in my own head than I was verbally. I was torturing myself, wanting to say things and not knowing how to be. The stand-up was a way out but it never came easy. So to have something that's named after me make it, and that has history tied to Desi and Freddie and now Freddie Jr., it's unbelievable to me because I never really thought anything good would happen to me. || Finally there is someone that you can invest in that looks like you, speaks like you, relates to things you relate to, and make our culture okay to talk about. || I want to tell you about a woman I have been married to for ten years, my wife, Ann, who speaking truthfully, saved me from myself. Who saved me from destroying myself because of my background. Who saved me from wasting my life, drinking my life away, never fulfilling my dreams because of what I had come from, and truly believing and loving - truly the first person to ever truthfully, unconditionally love me. || No Angie, it's instant. Like when someone trips in the cafeteria and you're laughing so hard milk comes out of your nose, the guy next to you is laughing so hard he accidentally farts. Boom! Friends for life! || You know how Mexican restaurants always have “border” in the name: Border Grill, Border Cafe. You wouldn’t do that to black people: Kunta’s Kitchen or Shackles. They don’t do it to white people. You don’t see the Honkey Grill, the Cracker Barrel…. oh, nevermind. || Mitt Romney wants the Latino vote. He ain't going to get it. He ain't going to get it. And you know why? Because Mitt Romney is a fucking Latino and he won't admit it. His father was born in Chihuahua, Mexico. Mitt Romney is a Chicano. But he won’t admit it. “I am not. I am Danish. I am French.” || And while we’re at it Sheriff Joe in Arizona, fuck you you fucking puto. How about that? Fuck you. You fat motherfucker. Fuck you. I said I was gonna talk some shit. Fuck you Sheriff Joe, you fucking puto. Fuck you. Fuck you. || I love comedy and I would write things to myself as an exercise in writing. I didn't do well for years, and I quit. I started to break down why I was afraid and started to look at people I admired, like Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Freddie Prinze, George Carlin and all. || If the worst thing that can happen is that nobody laughs, then I can deal with that, because the worst thing that can happen at the factory is that I could lose a limb or be crushed by a huge machine. || I didn't come from a background where I saw a lot of loving couples. All my aunts and uncles were either split up or fighting all the time. The only healthy relationships I saw were on TV. || I’m not trying to catch the right formula and do that every night. That’s not fun for me. It’s all about spontaneity. || It's not even about black and white anymore, because so many people are from mixed backgrounds and mixed ethnicities, and it's just a great time to be able to pull all that together. || I can't pay her back, but what I can do is make her as happy as she thought I would when we first got married. || I used to be ashamed by the way that I grew up. I tried to lie my way through better times, but when you think that honesty and truth is really your best weapon you embrace it and put it behind you. In the end, it drives you and motivates you to do good work. No one should be ashamed about where they come from as long as you desire to be a compassionate and decent person. || We have 93 million households, and we’re in a beautiful position at 11 o’clock. There’s an audience out there that’s underserved. In the continuing diversity of the country, and as people become more familiar with you, you realize it’s not your father’s country anymore. || I think it's easier for African American and white comics to be praised than it is Latinos because they think our culture or our humor is substandard. I mean, I just don't think they want to give us credit. I just don't think that they see us as important enough to be at their level. I'm the longest-produced comedy at Warner Bros. and I don't feel special. They come over and say hello. But everybody's gonna make a lot of money and I don't feel like I'm special to them. || Life is moments going by, but if you don't grab them, they're gone. For a long time, the only moments that were available were bad ones. So now I make sure to grab the good ones. || When you go to cable, there are no stations and no affiliates and they allow you to do your show. || I've gotten to a place where I am comfortable and I don't battle myself. I'm further ahead than I ever thought I'd be. I've exceeded everyone's expectations. Including, I think, my own. || I've spent days in cinemas answering questions from the audience, in interviews, travelling abroad, and all they do is thank me nicely. || Mexican people never say they’re sorry. My grandmother, when I was young, hit me with her car. I was in the driveway–pang! “You know where I park, cabron. Mira, where the oil is.” Did she say she was sorry? “Ta loco, he’s seven. When he starts paying the bills, then I’ll say sorry.” || I had a very difficult childhood. I was surrounded by people who had both parents, which made me feel different. Having a bit of a rougher existence early on, it made me appreciate the work ethic that my grandparents instilled in me. || If laughter is the best medicine, I promise to continue to make you laugh as my wife and I work together with the National Kidney Foundation to save lives. || I'd shake his hand, but I think that's what's holding up his pants. || As long as you are a tax deduction, you will always be safe in my house. || People who are homeless, they're not all addicts. A lot of times, they're just people who, through something like losing their job or losing someone in their life, ended up on the streets. So much of our time is spent in cars that sometimes you need to look out of those windows. And you see that a dollar, 50 cents, whatever you have, may not mean much to you, but it means everything to people who are hungry and who are in need. || Just ’cause you can’t control yours, don’t throw us all out! || It's good to see people not smoking. You get dressed up, and you smoke, and it gets in your clothes. You go, ‘What should I wear tonight?’ ‘I don't know, honey, how about something menthol?’ || Presents? We already bought you a lot of things. Member when we were at the market and I bought you gum? You'member. || I have little compassion for people in trailer parks who refuse to move after getting tornado warnings. How hard is it for them to relocate? Their house have wheels. || It was June 4, 1979, the first time I went on stage. I didn't know I could do it but I knew I couldn't not do it. I quit everything in my life and this was the one thing I couldn't quit. || Tasers don’t work on us. When you grow up poor, you get shocked by shit every single day. Toasters, lamps... || The average late-night viewer is in their mid-50s and the average viewer of TBS is in their 30s and is largely African-American and Hispanic, already, before I even get there. || One day, there will be a Latino president.  It could be the mayor of San Antonio. And when he’s all crudo, he can send his brother out there. || At the factory, I deal with ex-cons, substance abusers, and sexual harassers. And I'm not just talking about my mom. || This is L.A. You wanna learn Spanish? Take the bus. || There's no one I admire more than Lee. To be Mexican-American at a time when our culture was really invisible, and to slay the best golfers in the world with a homemade, 'freehand' swing, which is such a Mexican thing, and for me to see that with the big eyes of a kid, as a lot of young kids connect success to Tiger, I connect my success to Lee. It turned out we both grew up knowing what it's like to be alone, we both learned how to mask some of that by being funny, and now to know him and love him, and have him love me more than anyone from my own upbringing, to have him call me 'My boy,' man, that's it. || I don`t know what to do about Max, Angie! Last yeah he was up waiting for Santa, and this year him and his little friends on the roof jacking his sleigh! God knows what Carmen will do with the elfs... || We didn’t have a ‘baby-proof’ house. Sometimes a 2-year-old with a hammer woke your ass up from a nap! || It's an honor to walk in the footsteps of a legend. As host I intend to honor the tradition of The Bob Hope Classic and have a great time blazing a new path. || Imagine going in knowing that no Mexican American before you had ever succeeded in a lead role. || I never get to do nothin' in this house! || The first night was awful because I was so afraid, and I was never more afraid because it was going out of my character to be outgoing and to be vulnerable and to be out there and onstage. My hands were sweaty and I couldn't swallow, and I drank a bottle of wine to calm my nerves. || I've gotten in trouble with every race you can imagine. || I wanted my character to be accessible and nonthreatening. || Memories, priceless. Well not really priceless, but there you go! || If you make waffles, throw out the first one. || When I look at the Gospel, I see how it is speaking to me at this time. I see how to be to others and it helps. || I never realized I could love people as much as I do now. || I didn't want to be nobody, and that was the only way I could be somebody was to do stand-up. || My wife gave me a book before we got married, Oh, the Places You'll Go!, by Dr. Seuss. She was trying to tell me something, about what I was capable of, but I didn't get it. Over time, I've sort of lived the message in that book, and I couldn't have without what golf taught me. So I put it in my bag while I played the Old Course, and on the last hole when I posed on the Swilcan Bridge, I held it up. || I am going to bring a more eclectic group of actors and a more eclectic group of musicians from Mana to Santana to Slash and Garth Brooks. I know some pretty high-profile people in Hollywood, in music and in comedy. They all seem to be supportive of the idea. || Obama is the closest thing to a Latino that we have. Barack. Everybody wants to see his birth certificate too. || Life is too short to not have an orgasm every day. || So I started to relax and would work on my act eight hours a day, sitting at a desk writing at my grandmother's house, and I would put on Richard Pryor Live on Long Beach and would play it like a loop and think and write. || What they have at Chuckie Cheese that we dont have at our house, you wanna see a mouse... stand there... pull the refrigerator out the wall."
George Wallace,"What lazy SOB invented the Clapper? What do I have to invent so I don’t have to get off my lazy butt and go over and flip that light switch. My father had a Clapper 30 years ago - me. || Like this girl said, after she caught me using her tooth brush. I said Why are you complaining? 30 mins ago you were licking my ass. || As the fly said while landing on the mirrored coffee table. Well... That's another way of looking at it. || Why does the Air Force need expensive new bombers? Have the people we've been bombing over the years been complaining? || Who ever heard of flight 5050? It's always flight 102, flight 216. 5050? They're telling you before you leave the gate - 50/50. Now go out there on runway 13 and give it your best shot. || My mother could say some stupid things. I do something wrong, she'd say things that didn't even make sense. ""You go to your room and you stay there until you know how to act."" I'm in my room for three hours. ""To be or not to be, that is the question."" || People don't let politicians kiss your babies. Those lips have been on lobbyist asses for years now. || My girlfriend likes to play doctor. So I always make her wait 90 minutes before I see her. || I swear some days I think I owe my toilet an apology. || Freaks everywhere. I went to a church in Chicago. Church had six Commandments and four do-the-best-you-cans. || I was walking around Taiwan and bought some flip flops for my feet. I said I wonder where were these made. Looked under the bottom. It said, ""just around the corner."" || Why is there a Bible in the Courtroom? Isn't that why we're here in the first place? Somebody is lying. || My girlfriend likes to play doctor, so I make her say ""Ahhhh"" then charge her $700."
Gilbert Gottfried,"At the Last Supper how come no one sat on the other side of the table? See, I think originally there were people sitting on the other side but those were the people going, ""You know, the air conditioning hits me right on the back on the neck."" || If the police ever try to pick me up, Michael Jackson told me I can hide out at his house. || I've always said my career is somewhere between children's programming and hard-core porn. || I personally think Miles Davis is a lot funnier than me. And he's working more. || Sometimes I'd sit and talk to Nostradamus and he'd just sit there go, ""I know. I know."" Once I went to movies with Nostradamus. I said, ""Boy, what did you think of that ending?"" He goes, ""What? You didn’t see that coming?"" || I predict one of these two teams will win the Super Bowl. || I've never been one of those who wanted to fill my calendar up 90 percent of the time. || I always felt bad for Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa lived a whole life helping starving children and dying villages, but she could never be declared a saint 'cause she never actually performed a miracle. And it was towards the end, she was desperate to perform a miracle, so she would go up to starving children and go, 'What's that behind your ear? It's a quarter!' || With Katrina, it's almost like the sequel that doesn't live up to the original. It's certainly a shocking event and a tragedy, but somehow as a big event it doesn't seem to carry as much weight with the public as 9/11 did. || I've done a lot of Fox shows since then - Married with Children, Living Single and a whole bunch of other Fox things. || How exactly do they prove that you've been masturbating? Do they dust for prints? || I host these bad movies late at night. || The pressure to being a comedian is being funny, but I've given that up, so there is no pressure whatsoever. || Every time you open the paper now, there seems to be another celebrity getting arrest for masturbation. First, it was Peewee Herman and then George Michael. If masturbation's a crime, I should be on death row. || Unfortunately, I've never been mistaken as Johnny Depp. || I've always felt sorry for Jesus 'cause you know no matter what he ever did, he could never live up to his father. || Japan is really advanced. They don't go to the beach. The beach comes to them. || If you have the Old Testament at home, if you flip the corner pages, you can see Jesus riding a horse. || No, generally I think influence is used as a nice word for plagiarism. || Well, I'm eventually gonna take the Daryl Hannah parts. || I have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates. If you look up comedy and tragedy, you will find a very old picture of two masks. One mask is tragedy. It looks like it's crying. The other mask is comedy. It looks like it's laughing. Nowadays, we would say, ""How tasteless and insensitive. A comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask."" || I was talking to Jesus, and I said, ""Jesus, I feel like no one will ever accept me."" And Jesus looked at me and said, ""You know what my theory is? Accept me or go to hell."" || I can't even find someone for a platonic relationship, much less the kind where someone wants to see me naked. || A man goes to the doctor for a check, and the doctor exams him and says ""I've got bad news, you've got cancer and alzheimers."" The man goes ""Thank god I don't have cancer."" || What do you get when you cross a genius with a hooker?

Parrots are how I've branched out."
Godfrey,"I wish people would understand that comedy is an art form, and that the same thing that makes a Picasso painting is the same thing that gives Bill Cosby the ability to do an hour of comedy on his kids. || I observe everything around me and when something hits me and it’s funny, that’s what I talk about. I’m a more observational kind of comic. || If Mandela were a comedian, I bet he would never get mad at a heckler, he'd give him or her a hug. || I love when they show the really gay prisoner in prison shows. He's the cutest inside but you know on the street he would be the ugliest. || If they played the world hunger commercials with some dope beats, they'd probably get mad donations son! || In the locker room. Some dude is staying a conversation with me. ""Hey not while you're drying your nutsack"". || The one thing you don’t want to be is a sucky clean comic. I hate sucky clean comics! It’s like Christian rock, bro. I’d rather listen to gospel and Christian rock. That’s cheating! || I use profanity because I like profanity, but I’m not vulgar. Big difference. I love profanity because I really think profanity is cool. || I just want people to know, “this dude is a funny dude. I’m a fan of this dude. Now I’m looking forward to the next one.” || Tell your girlfriend or wife you love them everyday. Like I do! || You've got to keep moving, keep creating. || Want to shut a racist white guy's mouth. Put him around Super human athletic black dudes. || I can always create new material. That's something I can control. || I got into trouble a lot in school. They say you're a disturbance in class. You're a distraction, they're moving you around. You never really get rewarded in class for being funny. You're a disturbance. But the funny kid is often witty and clever and quick... they finally get a chance to express themselves when they get out of school. || That's what I take pride in in my stand-up, is changing things up. Being special. || But there's times when I like to find the strange angles to something. People go, 'I heard a lot of jokes like that, but that's one of the most interesting takes I heard.' That's what I try to do. || I'm forever a part of pop culture. || I want to be able to go into a room of aliens and be funny. I don’t care who it is. I don’t ever want to limit myself to a type of comedy because I don’t want to be stuck. I want to be able to make anybody laugh and that’s the key for me. || I could be talking about cats and someone who’s a cat owner can go, “Hey man, you shouldn’t talk about cats!” and I’m like, “I bet you if your cat was sitting here he wouldn’t know what the fuck I was talking about.” || But some people want attention so bad they want you to see them angry at you. || I would say, as far as heckling, there’s benign and there’s malignant; like tumors man. Sometimes you get really nice hecklers. I’d say percentage-wise it’s only about 10 to 20 percent the whole year. || You know your school is crappy when they advertise it on the subway. || My black friends in America don't believe me. I said, 'Dude, I'm Nigerian American.' 'Word? We thought you were, like, regular black.' What the hell is 'regular black'? Crayola coming out with colors I don't know about? || You know what the bodega is? It's the little Latin store, and they try to act like it's a grocery store. It has two aisles. And the guy, he always tries to help me, 'You looking for the bread?' I was like, 'Dude, I can see it right here, alright.' He's like, 'Hey, hey, it's in aisle two.' That's all you got, what are you talking about? || The X-Games - I watch that; I'm not impressed. That's white dudes' desperation. They're running out of sports. They gotta find something that black dudes won't touch. || I was always the class clown, although many teachers view the class clown as a trouble maker. But I always had good grades, so the only thing my parents were told was that while I was intelligent, I talked too much. || Thanks for the shortest month, asses - and the coldest. || I went to University of Illinois. Big school. 35,000 students. 800 black… I was the only black in every class. Hard to be absent. || When my woman kisses me I start dancing like James Brown. Ow! I Feel Good! || You ever pull out money too big in front of a homeless dude? You're like, 'Let me give you some - oh, shit.' He like, 'Give me that $100.' 'No, here's some pennies.' || You know, the energy I think I was just born with. I think I was just always like that as I kid; I was always real energetic. || In general I believe in treating everybody nicely. I just think everybody doesn’t have to be an asshole. I just don’t understand why, because everybody wants to make it so badly when it comes to the fame and money, everybody turns to shit. I believe you can actually make money and be cool. || This is my life, man! You can’t tell me how to talk about my life. People come with that kind of arrogance like, “you need to be talking about this.” I say, “well you need to go listen to Christian comedy then.” It’s like listening to Christian rock, it just doesn’t count. You can either sing gospel or Catholic Church music, stay away from rock. You can’t rock a solo to Jesus, I’m sorry. No, I’m listening to Zeppelin dude. || Customs is punishment for those who travel. This will teach you for traveling to our country! || I think anybody that protests at a comedy club is too easy. If you have problems and issues, you need to go to the White House and complain to Congress. Don’t come to a comedy club and bitch. That’s too easy. || My parents are immigrants. Came here with no money. Not this welfare thing. Welfare’s luxury… They came to the airport naked. “Can we get on the plane? I don’t want to show you where my passport is.” || The weatherman gets to curse in Chicago - it's license, it's a law, I'm serious. 'What's the five day outlook? Holy shit. It's cold as fuck out, that's what it is.' And there's a picture of a snowman with his middle finger up. || I think there are people living in Walmart dressed up as employees. || Even if you get a joke right you’ve done it a thousand times and sometimes there’s times where it just doesn’t work or someone doesn’t agree with you. And I want to show that. I have had more hecklers because that’s part of comedy is arguments, you know? || I'm still trying to understand the wearing off high heels at the airport. || Be happy with your stereotype. Asians - that's the stereotype I want. Being the smartest person in the world? You're the smartest, what are you complaining about? You know what I get? 'Wassup?' || I think that sometimes I’ve been a little too nice. I think you have to have a balance. When you’re too nice people take you for granted, they take you for a fool I think. || Immigrants have been coming here for a long time. The Americans that are afraid of others coming were immigrants once themselves, so they have a lot of nerve. We have a lot of nerve as a country. The only people that should have xenophobia are Native Americans. Everyone else should shut up. || I think the audience should take away that it’s okay to be smart, it’s okay to be funny and well-learned. You can be from academia and be funny; you don’t have to be an idiot. || People will bitch about anything. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t even have to necessarily be a serious topic like religion. It could be anything and people will have a problem. I’m telling you! It could be anything. || Hey man! I’m a comedian but I’m not a clown. || I used to think it was corny to be in love but actually it's corny to lose an awesome woman! Real talk."
Greg Behrendt,"Don’t be flattered that he misses you. He should miss you. You are deeply missable. However, he’s still the same person who just broke up with you. Remember, the only reason he can miss you is because he’s choosing, every day, not to be with you. || You picked a lemon, throw it away lemonade is overrated. Freaks should remain at the circus, not in your apartment. You already have one asshole. You don’t need another. Make a space in your life for the glorious things you deserve. Have faith. || We have become a sloppy bunch of people. We say things we don't mean. We make promises we don't keep. ""I'll call you."" ""Let's get together."" We know we won't. || If a man is really into you, nothing will stop him from being with you - including a fear of intimacy. || If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. || Let’s start with this statistic: You are delicious. Be brave, my sweet. I know you can get lonely. I know you can crave companionship and sex and love so badly that it physically hurts. But I truly believe that the only way you can find out that there’s something better out there is to first believe there’s something better out there. What other choice is there? || Feeling in love  and fear feel a lot alike. They both give you that anxious butterfly feeling in your stomach, a sense of excitement, and a general unease physically and mentally. It's easy to confuse love with fear. || People are inspired to do remarkable things to find and be with the one they love. || The reason it's so painful when someone disappears is you have to face the fact that the person you loved had probably left you a long time before he grabbed his coat and scrammed. || He’s just not that into you if he only wants to see you when he’s drunk. If he likes you, he’ll want to see you when his judgment isn’t impaired. || Drinking, eating, shopping, revenge, rebound sex, drugs or whatever your poison may be will number the pain - but that's all. || I'm about to make a wild, extreme and severe relationship rule: the word busy is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word ""busy"" is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember men are never to busy to get what they want. || If he's unsure, then he's unsure, and that's an answer - unsure is 'no.' The phrase 'I love you, but I'm not in love with you' really is this. The first 'I love you' means, 'I don't want to hurt you.' The second one means, 'I'm not in love with you.' That's bad news. 'I'm not in love with you' is 'I'm not in love with you.' || I think the time it takes to feel better about a break up is directly proportional to the time it takes to feel better about yourself. || Two people in a relationship either grow together or apart over time. || This country is in a big hurry to go nowhere. || I like the idea that when a guy comes over to the house, I get to say I wrote the book. || I don't have to edit myself. I get to be me, warts and all, and that's ultimately what people want, and to trust each other implicitly. || Part of being a comedian is that it's your job to look at life and regurgitate it in a funny way, to point out its absurdities. || I've never tried to pass myself off as anything more than a comedian who wrote a dating book. || Don’t idolize anyone if you can. You know, be inspired by people, certainly, but don’t idolize people… Because they’ll let you down. || Even with all the mayonnaise in the world, you can't make chicken salad out of chicken shit. || Life's biggest rewards come from the biggest challenges. || Why should you feel honored for getting scraps of his time? || I believe in love in hindsight, meaning attraction and connection can be remembered as love at first sight. But how could you possibly know at first sight? That's too much pressure to put on a relationship. || There are only so many ways to get people to go see stand-up, that it really is about the product; it’s not so much about the theme of the show.  || Having feelings doesn’t mean you have to have sex. || I'm just not interested in daytime television, which is something you should remember the next time somebody offers you a daytime talk show. || I’m the co-author of two relatively popular relationship books…Because of that I’m asked questions quite a bit… Questions about the relationships the person is in. Generally, it’s a woman. Generally, the answers are pretty easy. “I’ve been seeing this guy, Greg. And he doesn’t call.” He doesn’t like you. That’s it. We don’t have to say any more… They’ll say, “Greg, my boyfriend is married…” Say that back to yourself. || A man who wants to make a relationship work will move mountains to keep the woman he loves. || Always be classy. Never be crazy. || Men would rather lose an arm out a city bus window than tell you simply, “You’re not the one.” We are quite sure you will kill us or yourself or both - or even worse, cry and yell at us. || I believe in love the verb, not the noun. || I think that God is disappointed in anal sex. I think he thinks to himself, “It’s just that I worked so hard on the vagina. I thought you guys would go crazy for it… It’s like the lobby of a great hotel. There’s carpeting and drapes and it’s warm. It’s an entry way and a exit way for babies, the greatest thing there is. And all you freaks want to do is to come in the back by the dumpster. I don’t get it!” || Remember always what you set out to get, and please don’t settle for less. || Sometimes people change their minds, sometimes they meet someone else, sometimes they get sober, and sometimes he was just a jerk who you’re lucky to be rid of. || Men, for the most part, like to pursue women. We like not knowing if we can catch you. We feel rewarded when we do. Especially when the chase is a long one. || If a guy is treating you like he doesn’t give a shit, he genuinely doesn’t give a shit. No exceptions. || For me, a breakup changed my entire life. I was a mess. I really got rocked, and I ended up turning it into a positive thing. || Everybody I know is bizarrely beautifully fucked up in some way. || I always say that I love magic but I hate magicians. I like being fooled. If you wave your hands in front of my face and I think you’re doing a trick, I’m easily impressed. If you pull a quarter out of my ear, I’m quite certain you’re a wizard. But I don’t like the way most magicians don’t act like they’re magical; they act like show business dicks. || My grandma used to say ""Sound your Klaxon when you come around a turn."" And I'd say ""Shut your fucking Klaxon I'm driving!"" Oh we had fun. || It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that have to announce that I ate kale and liked it. || Breakups hurt like a motherfucker, but they are not the end of the world. The pain is temporary, and if handled properly, they can even be life-changing. || Lying, cheating, hiding is the exact opposite of the behavior of a man who’s really into you. || There`s nothing wrong with sending a quick note if you`re busy or just want to flirt, but it`s hard to have any real interaction over text. In the buffet of communication, text messaging should be a side dish, not the entree. || I love to eat. That's why I got so fat; I love to eat. If I don't walk away from a meal hurting, I didn't do it right. If I don't walk away from Thanksgiving dinner feeling like I've been turkey-fucked in a gingerbread prison, I didn't do it right. || I'm in an abusive relationship with butter. And I'm the only one getting hurt. || If I had butterscotch pants and a cheetah sweater... I'd be just fine. || I'm no longer a prisoner of my fears. Which really just means I'm using real butter. || I just told someone they had a ""manly-ass jacket."" I may have to give up speaking as my primary form of communication. || It's time to stop pretending I'm ok with things I'm not ok with like all insects and Foster the People. || People don't admire you for what you hate, they admire you for what you do about it, and your slacks. || She didn't love me that much, but she moved in with me. That's a plus. And then one night, I caught her making out with another dude on the driveway. That's a minus. || You break up with us, we get drunk and then stand on your lawn, and then a cop comes. I'll be like, 'Oh, this is over! I get it. It's over. Gotcha.' || Why wouldn't he be, he's the son of God? He's not gonna be walking around going, 'Oh, I've got back fat today. I'm so puffy.' || When you unleash the mix upon her, she will understand the beauty of who you are as a human being, and then she will melt and be in your bedroom soon. That's the plan with the mix. || For as much as I know about being a guy, I ought to go to a hardware store wearing a tiara. 'Hi, do you have a bang-bang-bang to put the pointy thing in? I need a grab-hold and twisty because I'm putting up some - help! - curtains.' || Can you deep fry the bacon? Oh how I wish you would... || I was coming down the street today with my girlfriend. This guy shouts out, 'Hey man, your girlfriend's a peach!' And I thought, 'Well, that's nice.' And then it turns out she has a really fuzzy face and a stem. || If a guy truly likes you, but for personal reasons he needs to take things slow, he will let you know that immediately. He won’t keep you guessing, because he’ll want to make sure you don’ get frustrated and go away. || One of the suckiest and most frustrating facts of life is that sometimes relationship just end, often without reason. I truly believe that sometimes both men and women simply run out of love, even when there was a lot of it in the beginning. || Personally, when I’m picking friends, I like the ones who don’t make me cry myself to sleep. || Sometimes we become attached to what’s familiar, and sometimes we hold on to things that are safe and predictable, even if they are bad for us. || If you date, you will meet your share of weirdos and jerks. That is as sure as death and taxes. || It is in that moment, when you really lay down your cards and see the relationship for what it was, that you'll find the freedom to kick it in the ass and let it go. || Before you look for validation in others, try and find it in yourself. || Cheating gets easier every time it's done. It's only hard the first time, when one feels the sting of morality and the guilt of betraying someone's trust. || Wasting time in a relationship that blows is just that - wasted time. || Anyone who assesses you or your relationship as disposable is not worthy of your time or tears. || Don’t spend your time on and give your heart to any guy who makes you wonder about anything related to his feelings for you. || If the guy you’re dating doesn’t seem to be completely into you, or you feel the need to start ‘figuring him out,’ please consider the glorious thought that he might just not be that into you. And then free yourself to go find someone that is. || He doesn’t have to love your CD collection. He doesn’t have to love your shoes. But any good, mature guy better make an attempt to love your friends and family - especially when they’re great. || Being brokenhearted is like having broken ribs. On the outside it looks like nothing's wrong, but every breath hurts. || I'm tired of seeing great women in bullshit relationships. || Cheaters never prosper. Because they suck. || 'But he was so great!’ Yes, and the people who got on the Titanic thought they were going on a vacation. || I have two rules when you come to my house on Halloween. Wear a costume - 'cause if you've manned your door at your own house, you know how many kids will roll up, 14 years old with no costume and an attitude. My other rule: don't grab. Let me assess you and then design a candy situation for you. || If he's choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn't respect your feelings and needs. || How many presidents, do you think, ever said to another guy: ‘I can’t believe we’re doing this in the White House’? || When a guy is into you, he lets you know it. He calls, he shows up, he wants to meet your friends, he can’t keep his eyes or hands off of you. || Just because he’s busy doesn’t make him more valuable. “Busy” does not mean “better”. || The pain of being in a bad relationship is confusing. When it’s over - it’s over. No more confusion! || I mean, every audience for me is different. It's like jazz; you have to feel them out at the beginning and see what they're up to and see what their resistance is and their strengths are and then you just sort of go towards that. || There are many different kinds of assholes in the world. But there's one particular kind of asshole that you see at the airport that's so annoying, and that is the person that is dressed like the destination to which it is they are flying. Do you know what I'm saying? The people that wear what they think the native costume of the land is that their going to. We're going to Denver, and I swear to you, this motherfucker had a parka made of bears. || My wife's beautiful. That's why I married her. Because I want to see her every day. || Young people are gross with their faces and their hope. || The day you realize you don't have to make sense to anyone is the day you start to make sense to you. || I'm certain prison is pretty rough as it is but imagine if you were a murderer and a foodie! || As a guy I never liked being told to call, which my wife really never does, and that’s why I call her as often as I do. || I mean, I feel like you can kill the same bird with both stones. || When we’re picking someone who we want to spend a lot of time with, even perhaps for the rest of our lives, we generally try to pick someone who likes to do the things we like to do. || If we’re friends with someone and attracted to them, we’re going to want to take it further. || If you can find him, then he can find you. If he wants to find you, he will. || Every time you see him, you only make yourself vulnerable to further heartache. Do you really need further proof that he’s getting on with his life without you? || It`s your version of whatever that is. We use those words because they are kind of empowering. Try to get back into your life and get back on track with dreams you have. There`s nothing more attractive than a person who likes herself. || It`s the prettiest place on the planet. My childhood was like a dream. It`s like the last Mayberry. || Send her a quick note while you`re stuck in a long meeting. A lighthearted chat definitely makes the time go faster. || I always tell people it's funny that they think I'm a relationship expert because my two books are about getting out of relationships. || Good enough to tweet, not to say. || If my father is walking around going, 'Mmm, pussy,' he's thinking about eating the cat. || When you're in your 20s and 30s and you drop some weight, people notice, they're nice about it. They're like, 'Hey man, you look good!' But when you're in your 40s and you lose weight, people are like, 'You doin' all right?' || I want you to be yourself, but not with other dudes. || We're taught that in life, we should try to look on the bright side. Not in this case. In this case, assume rejection first. Assume you're the rule, not the exception. It's liberating. But we also know it's not an easy concept. || If you sell things over the phone, the dream went awry somewhere, and you're working in a sweat box trying to make quota so you can buy some speed. || At this point in time, that's like saying you're not 'into the phone.' || So, I play in a band. It's a really underground band. Super underground. Very underground. Like, we don't even actually play. || He's the badass of the group - like if they get into some kind of Scooby-Doo scrape, he's the one that's gonna get them out. || My buddy Tom... he'd been chasing a girl for two years, and he got her the old-fashioned way - dates and listening. || Most comics worship music on some level. It's more rock-n-roll to get up there for an hour and make people laugh. || People say get a job doing something you love. So far no one has offered to hire me to eat Whoppers with a switchblade. || Most people don't want to leave their wife and children behind but many people seem to want to take leave of themselves. || There are three kinda men in the world. There's men that own rope,  men that use eye creme, and that dude from Nickleback. || So, I'm 34. I'm kind of becoming an adult - kind of, I guess. But I know that I am because, the other day, I said to somebody, 'Dude, dude, don't - those are the good plates.' || I'm just saying, tonight, if you're going through a breakup and you're drinking, don't call. Just don't do it. Don't call. Because here's the thing: booze has information in it! || If you open up the hood and start talking about, 'That's got a dual-head-cammy,' you might as well say, 'Banana, banana, banana.' I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. || Alone also means available for someone outstanding. || When it comes to men, deal with them as they are, not how you’d like them to be. || Because here’s what guys don’t do if they can’t live without you: they don’t break up with you. || There will never be a good time financially to get married unless you're Shaq or Ray Romano. But somehow people manage. If your man is using money as an excuse not to marry you its your relationship that's insecure not his bank account. || First of all never buy a man a plasma TV until youre married. A lot of men once they have a plasma TV they don't need a girlfriend. || Be yourself. If something you do doesn't work, don't do it the next time. Listen to yourself - you know what appropriate behavior is. || My daughter genuinely asked me to hand her the basketball bat. I might be failing as a father. || Life is hard enough as it is without choosing someone difficult to share it with. || Here's something else to think about: calling when you say you're going to is the very first brick in the house you are building of love and trust. If he can't lay this one stupid brick down, you ain't never gonna have a house baby, and it's cold outside. || Let’s start with this statistic: You are delicious. Be brave, my sweet. I know you can get lonely. I know you can crave companionship and sex and love so badly that it physically hurts. But I truly believe that the only way you can find out that there’s something better out there is to first believe there’s something better out there. What other choice is there? || If you bury the pain deep down it will stay with you indefinitely, but if you open yourself to it, experience it, and deal with it head-on, you’ll find it begins to move on after a while. || Part of me also knows that this generation is the least racist and most pro-gay, so that’s great. But they have a real lack of gravitas. And they have no taste in music. Vampire Weekend? Can we play some music, please? Can we rock out for a minute? Where’s your Metallica? || I’m anal and forgetful. That’s a bad combo. That mean I like my shit where I like it and I don’t know where the fuck it is. But I’m pretty sure it’s your fault. || I have less friends, but I have more Cadbury Eggs. || Often the thought of pain is actually worse that the pain itself. || Turning a breakup into a break-over... We want women to know that as bad as it can be, it can also be an opportunity to reinvent yourself. || Better than nothing is not good enough for you! || Here's something else to think about: calling when you say you're going to is the very first brick in the house you are building of love and trust. If he can't lay this one stupid brick down, you ain't never gonna have a house baby, and it's cold outside. || Don't you want the guy who'll forget about all the other things in his life before he forgets about you? || Try not to be four years into a relationship when it suddenly dawns on you that the guy you're with is a big, selfish jerk. || It's very tempting when you really want to be with someone to settle for much, much less - even a vague pathetic facsimile of less - than you would have ever imagined. Remember always what you set out to get and please don't settle for less. These guys exist because there are a lot of women out there who allow them to. || I will go anywhere if you say the phrase 'there might be cake.' I would go to the Department of Motor Vehicles, register somebody else's boat in Spanish, a language I do not speak, without ID - for cake."
Greg Fitzsimmons,"If you want to find guys with small penises, go to the Hummer dealership. || When you're 18, you meet somebody, and 15 seconds later, you're like, 'I love you... I love you! Is that your roommate? She's hot.' || Rescuing dogs is looked upon as a noble, trendy pursuit. But wouldn't rescuing a man from a homeless shelter be, in fact, more humane? || My kids teased me at dinner that I'm not cool. I told them if I was cool I wouldn't be sitting at home with my kids. Pass the gravy. || The United States of America will fare well so long as it has enough water to let it go to waste, both literally and figuratively. And he imagines how someone from an impoverished third-world nation must react to our collective nonchalant wasting of water, or of throwing money into fountains. || I never know what I'm going to say as I walk up to the microphone. I try to be in the moment. I try to go deeper into myself. I discover things on stage that I don't discover off stage about me. || I've got a three year-old and he wants to rollerblade and he said, ""Daddy, I want to put on my helmet,"" and I said, ""Suck it up, kid. We don't wear helmets in this family; we're men. No, not on the sidewalk - get in the street."" || I have to stop watching the Olympics. It just reminds me that I forgot to try really hard at something. || If we don't have souls then who am I talking to when I keep telling myself to be good? || Somebody stole my identity. Good luck using it without the medications. || They say no one knows if we all see red the same way. Except traffic cops. || It’s an amazingly consistent thing with Irish people. We will talk to strangers at parties for hours. It’s what we were bred to do I think. And the Jewish people were bred to write the stuff that we say. || I'm kinda stuck in that awkward in-between stage where my hair is just starting to fall out, but I'm still maintaining my youthful acne. || As a single couple, we are no longer able to hang around with married couples 'cause they cannot be in our presence without getting very annoying. It's always like, 'So, when are you guys getting married? Huh? When are you getting married? When are you guys getting married?!' I dunno, you're married - when are you gonna die? You're already married, death will be next. When are you gonna die? || The most interesting hipsters are ones who stop being hipsters. || It’s the only state in the country where you can stand on your front porch and actually watch your dog run away for three days. || I went to Las Vegas. I was playing craps because I had a lot of money and I needed to lose it very quickly. Crap must have been the worse word available when that game was invented. If they invented it today, they’d have to call it “motherfucker.” || Lieutenant Governor Paterson - blind, black guy - gets sworn in. First thing he says is, 'By the way, cheated on my wife. Let's just get that out in the open right now.' He didn't need to admit that. He's blind. Could have said it was an accident. || I think the Republicans took all the fun out of 'gay.' I mean the word gay - it's fun. But now it's a ban on same sex partners. That sounds horrible. I mean, when do you hear a ban? When it's a toxic pesticide or a nuclear warhead. And who wants to fuck a partner? It sounds like a guy in a gray suit at a law firm. || Same thing every year: up at the crack of dawn, drinking, fighting, throwing up, pissing on walls - and then you leave the house. || When you're not 21, it's great to drink because you're not allowed to. You're a rebel: you gotta get a fake I.D., you gotta find a place to drink it, you gotta sneak in drunk. And if you get away with all that, you're laying in bed, your heart's pounding, you got vomit on your chin. You're like, 'I'm a rebel!' And you are. You're cool. || When I was 18, I thought I was in love. First time - you know that magic feeling. So, I asked my father. I said, 'Dad is love real?' And he said, 'No. But herpes is, so watch your ass.' || The best drunks are the ones who only hang out with other drunks in places we  all know are filled with drunks. || When a banana gets rotten people love to tell you that you can make banana bread out of it. I have never seen anyone actually do it. || I feel like I am too old to eat jelly. But I am too young to eat prunes. I am between grapes. || I love when problems have simple solutions. Cold medicine. Umbrellas. Condoms. Tax incentives & subsidies attracting favored industries. || The most interesting nerds are the ones who take offense to being called nerds. || When I saw people dancing to it in jeans that had been dry-cleaned and cowboy boats and you're in New York City - that's when I said hand guns should be legal. || Don’t be like me. Look at me: monogamous, in shape, no debt, sober... I’m dead inside. || New York is a funny place. I was at the coffee shop last week, and I'm paying the cashier for my cup of coffee, and the other girl got sprayed by the espresso machine with the hot milk. And her shirt was burning her, and so she just ripped it off. But she forgot she has no bra on, and so she just ran in the back. And the cashier looks at me and goes, 'That'll be an extra two bucks.' || We're at a wishing well one day. I'm with my son and I give him a penny, and I said, 'Owen, you take this penny, you throw it in the water, and you can wish for anything you want.' So he takes the penny, throws it into the water. I go, 'What'd you wish for?' He goes, 'To throw the penny in the water.' || They make that announcement, 'If you notice anything unusual, please immediately report it to airport security.' So, I grab the guy, I go, 'Yeah, I just saw somebody pay $11 for a cup of coffee at Starbucks. And right around the corner, they're selling luggage inside the airport. I'm going to do another lap. I'll let you know if I see anything.' || They say men have a sexual thought every 20 seconds. The other 19 are shame. || She goes, 'No, this is really good for his immune system.' I said 'Two years? I think at this time, we can safely dunk him in a bucket of polio.' || They just tested the tap water in Los Angeles and they found traces of estrogen and antidepressants in the tap water. So it’s nice to know my son’s going to grow up and have huge breasts but it’s not going to bother him that much. || I've finally been able to trust and have intimacy with somebody, which I've never been able to do. Like a lot of guys, I just have a hard time getting that connected. I can actually sleep with her in my arms - spoons position, right? Women smile, they love the spoons. Men would rather fork. || Last time I was out here was not too long after 9/11, and you could not drive a car to the airport at that time. That was one of the first safety precautions: only taxis could go to the airport. Because, really, what better way of stemming the flow of Muslims to the airport than only allowing taxis? || I enjoy writing the same way I enjoy doing standup. Part of the challenge is being creative and making it work no matter what the constraints. || We are now able to create virtual realities on computers. Are we all living in one created by someone in the future? ||  I knew that drinking and doing stand-up was going to make me less of an effective comedian. And I just had a lot invested in wanting to be a really good comedian and so I stopped for that reason. || Debt means you had more fun than you were supposed to. || Ever see a skinny guy on a cold day? You know they tremble like Chihuahuas. Then you see a fat guy in a tank top - nine degrees, he's sweatin'. Look at 'Titanic,' remember the boat goes into the icy cold waters? Little skinny Leonardo: dead. Final scene, Kathy Bates on a rowboat, coat open, eating a hotdog. || Iowa's the worst. Iowa's just nothing, just flat as far as you can see. It's the only state in the country where you can stand on your front porch and actually watch your dog run away for three days. || These are the big breakthroughs in science and technology in the last 10 years: we have Rogaine, Prozac, now we have Viagra. You get a sense for who's bankrolling medical research in this country. It's just depressed, balding, white guys who can't get erections anymore. God forbid they cure something important, like muscular dystrophy. It's like, 'Sorry, little Johnny, you can't get up, but look - I can.' || Years after he was castrated in a horrible industrial accident, she continued having kids, just out of habit - black kids, white kids, Chinese kids. We don't know how she did it - we know how she did it, we just don't like to talk about it. || I called my grandmother yesterday. She picks up the phone, 'Oh hello, dear, hold on a second, I just stepped out of the shower. Let me go put some clothes on.' I said, 'Hey Grandma, don't ever tell me you're naked again. Go put a lot of clothes on. Then put some more clothes on. I'm going to sit here and drink and try to forget you naked in my head.' I'll never eat raisins again. || Trickle-down economics - it didn't work. The whole idea was supply-side economics: give rich people a lot of money; they'll spend it, it'll go into the economy. Here's what we found out - rich people, really good at keeping all the money. That's how they got rich. If you want it in the economy, give it to the poor people. You know what they're really good at? Spending all their money. || I went to the gas station the other day, and the gas station attendant said he was a former porno movie star. And I think he was serious because half through filling the tank, he pulled it out and sprayed it all over the car. || My friend goes, 'If you're going to use Rogaine, just put it somewhere you're going to remember to use it everyday.' So I put it right next to my Prozac. But now it just feels really pathetic using both of these products at the same time, 'cause if either one works, I don't really need the other one. || My grandfather is from Ireland. His name is Florence McCarthy. He moved to New York in 1920. They used to beat him up because his name was Florence. He had to switch his name to Frank. And then this Christmas, he made an announcement - he goes, 'I'm switching me name back to Florence.' And we beat him up, 'cause it's a dumb name and he's old and weak and it was easy. || At some point, the computer industry decided if you have an e-mail address, you must have some kind of penis problem. || Nothing screams “welcome for one night” like the inflatable mattress. “Hey, I threw a sheet on a pool raft. Hope you like it.” || When you first start having sex with somebody, you never discuss what you like and don't like. You just try stuff, and the other person either goes, 'Ooh yeah,' or they go, 'Hey, don't do that!' || If you want to stop two people from having sex, let them get married. || I do have hair; the hair is just not everywhere. I realize it's really just at the holes: my nose, my ears, my butt. I'm like a tub: just sheer white porcelain, and then a clump of hair at the drain. || I realized that every second that I'm alive, the world cares less about me. It's just a very linear, downward progression. And it sounds cynical because you guys are young and you're full with life. I want you to understand - this is it. You have nothing to look forward to because you're peaking. If you're not having fun now, kill yourself. I don't mean that in a bad way, just - it's not worth it to go forward. || Taking down the Christmas tree makes it feel official: time to get back to joyless and cynical. || My father told me when I first started that standup is exciting and I should pursue it, but that writing would be the thing that would give me power over my career. I never have to take a road gig or a writing gig I don’t want because I always have the ability to play one against the other."
Greg Giraldo,"I saw one of those giant Hummer cars with handicapped tags on it. I thought, 'Wow, I never realized that being an asshole was technically a handicap.' || People always want to compare their dogs to having kids. That's insulting. First of all, nobody has a dog because they were too drunk to pull out. || I've always had real trouble knowing what my actual desires and goals are. I've just been dragged along by fate. || Why is marijuana not legal? It's a natural plant that grows in the dirt. Do you know what's not natural? Eighty-year-old dudes with hard-ons. That's not natural. But we got pills for that. We're dedicating all our medical resources to keeping the old guys erect, but we're putting people in jail for something that grows in the dirt? || A good joke provides tension, and then, release of that tension. You build the tension by saying things that are controversial. The release is the laugh. The bigger the surprise or insight in your joke, the bigger the laugh. || Joke stealing is a big deal to me, but I mean, I’m not going to investigate it if it doesn’t effect me directly. || Valentine's day has gotten blown way out of proportion. Valentine's Day just used to be for your girlfriend or your wife but now everyone's like 'Oh, happy valentine's day!' I even got a Valentine's Day card from my grandmother. How ridiculous is that? We stopped having sex years ago! || A doctor was telling me a lot of people aren't getting their kids circumcised. How many people aren't doing it? I'm not looking to be a trendsetter when it comes to my kid's penis. I don't want my kid to be the only guy in the locker room with a schlong that looks like it's about to rob a bank. || Once I saw a homeless man wearing his underwear on top of his pants. Now we say, why don’t the homeless just go out and get a job? If he’s wearing his underwear on top of his pants, I doubt his resume is in order, and I don’t think he’s going to make it too far in the interview process. In fact, I’m pretty sure that McDonald’s has a no underwear over your pant policy. || Look at the insane things the Jews believe. The Jews believe that Barbra Streisand is worth $1,000 bucks a ticket. || I read recently that 50% of American adults don't know who Madeleine Albright is. Can you believe that? She was so good on 'Murder, She Wrote.' || You are what you are. You don’t choose to be gay or straight. I don’t choose to be attracted to women, it sucks. I lose half my shit every ten years and have to start fresh. || Why do we need another station where everyone has a gun? We already have BET. || I didn’t think I was older until I went into an Abercrombie & Fitch and they looked at me like I was walking through a playground with my cock in my hand. || India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons. How did they get nuclear weapons? Those are dirt poor countries. Their armies don't even have matching uniforms. They go to war, they've got to call each other up, 'Wear something tough looking.' || There’s been so much talk in the news lately about illegal aliens in the workplace. When was the last time an illegal alien stole your job? Oh yeah, that dream job of the Chinese Delivery man pedaling up Broadway delivering Chinese food for 40 cents an hour, or on the back of a landscaping truck with 15 others. || If you spend five minutes with me or watch me try to balance my checkbook, you can only imagine the disaster I would make of anyone's legal issues. || Americans are not gonna conserve. We're not gonna shift to smaller cars. We can't - we have big, fat kids. || The reality is I'm not a 'get knocked down and come back harder' kind of guy. || The Virgin Mary... We have a whole religion based on a woman who really stuck to her story. || I’d vote for myself because I couldn’t possibly suck as bad as our other options. || The internet's a creepy thing, especially if you have kids. It says something very creepy about the fact that I use the same machine to masturbate with as I use to teach my kid the alphabet. || Terrorism is obviously on everybody's mind. The other day my son says to me, 'Daddy, how come the bad men hate us?' How sad is that? I actually got tears in my eyes - because he's 18. What kind of a moron am I raising? || You know we have more prescription drugs now. Every commercial that comes on TV is a prescription drug ad. I can’t watch TV for four minutes without thinking I have five serious diseases. Like: “Do you ever wake up tired in the mornings?” Oh my god I have this, write this down. Whatever it is, I have this. || That show 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy' has been getting a lot of ratings. People love that show. That's a great idea for a show. You get four gay guys that try to make a straight guy gayer. That's a good idea for a show. We used to just call that Boy Scout camp. || You're gonna check my computer records? Is that important? I don't think the government needs to know how I feel about teen Asian sluts in order to fight terrorism. || I think all gay guys should get married. I think they should have to get married. They should have to adopt kids because, actually, I'm getting tired of their happy-go-lucky lifestyle. I've had it with them being all happy and in shape. I could look good in denim short shorts and combat boots, too, if I had all day to do leg presses at the gym. || We're having one of those babies soon. I'm really excited about it because it's probably my first kid. || Peanut allergies. When did the peanut become the most toxic substance known to man? Have you tried going anywhere near a school with peanut butter? Holy shit! They look at you like you slathered it on your cock and went skipping across the playground! || We need more money for schools. We need more money for the kids. Ever think maybe the damn kids aren't worth it? || It's something like 70% of American adults are obese, and the rest of them are women on Ally McBeal. || Gilbert Gottfried is famously cheap. I’m impressed you’re here Gilbert. You gotta buy new clothes and take a week off work just to do this. But you showed up. You tightened your belt and you came. You’re like David Carradine. || I like when people give up chocolate for Lent. Ooh, just like being nailed to a cross. || Seventy-two virgins - does that make sense to anyone? And it's an ancient religion, maybe it was misinterpreted? Maybe it's not 72 virgins, maybe it's a 7-foot-2 Persian. || Norm MacDonald is here - one of the funniest people ever. Norm's got a giant gambling problem. He's dropped more coin in a casino than Michael J. Fox at a parking meter. || Wallmart had their employees switch from saying “Merry Christmas” to “Happy Holidays”. How many Jews are really shopping at Wallmart? In fact, if you’re a Jew shopping at Wallmart, your life probably hasn’t gone as planned. || They found two birds in Whitestone, Queens that were infected with the virus. Who finds these birds? I grew up in Queens. We used to find dead birds all the time. We didn't take them in for autopsies. We picked them up, and we threw them at the gay kid. || Sometimes you have to suffer a little bit in your youth to motivate yourself to succeed in later life. If Bill Gates had got laid in high school, do you think there'd be a Microsoft? || There hasn’t been a more effeminate Jew in the closet since Anne Frank. || There was this guy recently who sued his landlord because he said scalding water from the shower burned his genitals. That's a hell of a way to test the water, huh? || Holy shit, everything comes from China nowadays. Do we make anything in America besides porn and autistic kids anymore? || Remember Osama bin Laden? Public enemy number one. We gotta get bin Laden. Then the new season of 'American Idol' came on, we're like, 'Ah, forget it. Whatever.' || You got a cop under five feet tall, what if he's gotta plant evidence on a high shelf? What then? What if he's gotta chase a suspect onto a ride at Disneyland? || This friend of mine told me, 'Yeah, I dress this way to attract a guy, but I want to attract the right guy. I don't want to attract every slob on the street.' That's how cleavage works. It's not a smart bomb. It's not a laser-guided weapon. You might hit your target; there's also going to be a lot of collateral damage. You might hit the guy in the Porsche. You're also going to hit the guy with one tooth driving by on the bus. || All the evidence we need that God is angry with us is Justin Timberlake’s career. || How many of you text message? It’s a great way of not communicating. || This homeless guy asked me for money the other day. I was about to give it to him and then I thought he was going to use it on drugs or alcohol. And then I thought, that's what I'm going to use it on. Why am I judging this poor bastard? || One time, I was trying to get on a plane. They wouldn’t let me. They said I was too drunk to get on a plane. You know how wasted you have to be for someone to say, “Sir, you’re just too drunk to sit in a seat.” || If being a gangster were a prerequisite to being a musician, there’d be a lot less cello music, for example. || It's hard to distinguish when I was actually struggling from when I only felt like I was struggling - which was pretty much always. || You try not to have a favorite when you have sons or kids. Can’t have a favorite. Can’t let them know know if you do. I don’t. I treat my main son and the other two exactly the same way. || Christine Todd Whitman had to resign as the head of the EPA; you know, when the governor of New Jersey decides the environment is hopeless, you gotta really think that one through. || The reality is I'm not this person with this driving 'get it done' attitude. || There are no black people in Iraq, so how will they know who to shoot at? || When I masturbate I fantasize about having my own apartment. I used to think about Cindy Crawford now I think about leaving a dish in the sink overnight. || Ice-T is so old that the first thing he bought with the money from his album sales was his freedom. || Look at Thomas Jefferson. The guy had illegitimate kids in the 1700s, and they caught him last year. If you cheat on your wife and cover it up for 200 years, you're pretty much thinking you're home free. || Even before the kids are born, you've go to make these decisions. If it's a boy, do we get him circumcised? If it's a girl, do we keep her? || We’re a spoiled, lazy culture, full of ethnic pride that has to have a parade for every nationality. || If you're going to dedicate your career to ranting about the excesses of American capitalism, you probably shouldn't weigh 450 pounds. || Edible underwear?… even during sex, we can't stop eating. || I used to think about Cindy Crawford; now, I think about leaving dishes in the sink overnight without a war breaking out. || The hardest part, for real, is probably when you just don't feel like going on stage and being funny. || Little did I know that earning a living at stand-up is the hardest thing you can do. But once I started doing it, I just loved it, and I realized that I was actually kinda good at it, and then that was it. || Some people are just really goofy kind of guitar acts, and they go out and do these colleges and start making a fortune pretty early on. And other people - I know guys who are great comics, who've done the Letterman show many times, who still barely pay their bills. || The Japanese scientists just found a 25,000-year-old mammoth in the ice in Siberia, and they're about to clone it... You think the Japanese of all people would want nothing to do with prehistoric animals after what happened with Godzilla. || People come to this country from all over the world to pursue their dreams of driving a taxi or selling hot dogs or working in a sweatshop. || The NRA is not pro-gun, they’re anti-varmint. || My advice to graduates is to stay positive. Life is short, and you'll be dead soon. || There are more whipped guys on television than there were on the Amistad. || If you join a gym, you gotta go a lot for it to work. I don't know how these gay guys do it. It's unbelievable. Every gay guy I know is built like a bodybuilder. When did that start happening? That's totally gonna change the stereotype, right? It's gonna be like, 'Do you think that guy's gay? Is he gay?' 'Oh yeah. He benches, like, 450 pounds.' || Part of growing up is learning your strengths and weaknesses. What better way to figure out that hand-eye coordination ain't your thing than by getting drilled in the mouth by a red, rubber ball? You only gotta get beaned in the face so many times before you figure out, 'I better hit the books because this is not working out.' || When I heard you could get a disease from playing with your prairie dog, I thought, 'Wow, what a euphemism.' I thought playing with my prairie dog was the best way to avoid diseases. || Christine Todd Whitman had to resign as the head of the EPA. You know, when the governor of New Jersey decides the environment is hopeless, you gotta really think that one through. || A dangerous fire retardant chemical is being found in women's breast milk. My wife's breastfeeding, but you know, you gotta be an optimist. I'm like, well, maybe it's making my child fireproof. || You think they could stop putting these experts on the news with their doomsday scenarios of how the terrorists might attack us? Because you get the sense they're coming up with ideas that these people haven't thought of themselves. || Do you know how short you have to be to have a Napoleon complex in North Korea? || It's all about self-esteem now. Build the kids' self-esteem, make them feel good about themselves. If everybody grows up with high self-esteem, who's gonna dance in our strip-clubs? || Some people say Larry the Cable Guy’s only successful because he’s pandering to the lowest common denominator, blatantly and not ironically exploiting people’s racist and homophobic tendencies. Don’t listen to these people, Larry. They’re just bitter and jealous and right. || George Bush says that gay people getting married would violate the sanctity of marriage. Is anybody here married? Does it feel like a gift from God to you? || The things that make me laugh are considered smart or whatever, I guess. But stuff that's self-consciously intelligent or self-consciously hip or cool, that doesn't do it for me either. You just try to be funny. || The only reason we're not in Iran now is because we're going alphabetically and George Bush can't spell. || If I drive my SUV I’m supporting terrorism. Okay, I’ll take a taxi, Is that better?"
Greg Proops,"Bush looked straight into the camera and said 'We must preserve the sanctity of marriage!' You know, straight people are doing such a fucking great job. || Think about everything you read and everything you see. The one thing we can learn from all the horrible things that have happened in the last 15-20 years is that hysteria is the last thing we need. Cool thinking, pragmatism, and analytical thought are most important at this point. || I think if you steal well, you’re a genius. If you copy badly, you’re a hack. || If you do not find me funny, that is your problem and I am not going away. || White pants should be worn on two occasions: One, never. And two, if you're selling ice cream. || Oh, I say I have an ocelot and it’s a joke, but I’ve had so many news programs in this country say, ""So what’s it like, having an ocelot?” And I’ll say, “It’s marvelous just to see them run free. When feeding time comes and they’re mewling, it just warms your heart."" People will really believe anything. You may have noticed this. It’s not just me. Look around. || Obviously the name of the show is a joke, a friend of mine gave it to me. But some people are very literal. Sometimes you see things like ""He's not the smartest man in the world! All he does is drink."" Well, they're not listening very closely. || Honesty and unpopular opinions are the toughest sell in a country with an irony-deficiency. || It's christmas. You know, the time of the year that reminds you what you don't fucking have. || How come we got the grumpy boat of bandy-legged Puritans? How come we didn't get the Italian party boat with the cappuccino makers and the gelato machine? That was the sexy boat, man. || Animals have two vital functions in today's society: to be delicious and to fit well. || You can't smoke in a restaurant in Los Angeles, which is mildly ironic, when you consider the fact that you can't breathe outside a restaurant in Los Angeles. || I’m as bouge as the next person. My mother was a waitress and my father was a bartender. People think I went to Yale and shit, because I have a vocabulary and I wear a suit. I wear a suit because I aspire to wear a fuckin’ suit. I didn’t work my whole fuckin’ life to wear a Hello Kitty fuckin’ wifebeater up here. || I’m old and my knowledge is strictly horizontal. || I like to go to England, and I'll tell you why. I like to go to a country where I am considered the best-looking person. It's as simple as that. Hollywood, kind of a crushing ego blow - 'Hey Buddy Holly, you are so old, have you not perished in a plane crash?' But not in England, good God, not there. In England, God bless that dinky island, there it's, 'Good God, look at him. He has all his teeth and his ears are in proportion to his head.' I'm Brad bloody Pitt on that island. || If you want to live in 'white world,' if you want to experience the stultifying boredom and penetrating ennui that homogeneity can bring, you can go to Canada any day of the year. It's an entire country named Doug. || Talking to the British about sex is like talking to Americans about reading. Nobody does it so why talk about it? || Don't yell at people. Stand up for what's right. Put yourself in the other persons place. Respect women. Don't take no for an answer. Laugh at yourself. Don't believe what you are told. Fall in love. || If Iraq's weapons are weapons of mass destruction, surely ours are weapons of growth and nurturing. || It doesn't matter how much of an asshole you are, there was always someone who thought you were cool. || Why does everyone leave just when its getting’ good? || We don’t know anything about Scottish history. All we know is that an American guy painted his face blue and somehow they won. || They celebrate Thanksgiving in England, by the way. It’s called “Fuck off puritan!” || I did stand up first in high school, joined an improv group in college, kept doing stand up after that, no one could deter me. And I have no other skills really, so I’m sorta stuck with this now. It’s a little late to switch over to an ornithologist. || You're in a bar - grow up. You're drinking poison. You're trying to have sex unsafely with someone you don't know. Is secondhand smoke really the chiefest of your health concerns at this point? || I would never advocate the use of dope because, you know, I'm not a professional athlete and I don't have access to the good stuff. || My feeling is, the Pilgrims were asked to leave England. England was never funner than when the Pilgrims split, right? The people of England got a little tired of these dour, right-winged conservative psycho-Christians wearing all black, bumming people out, confusing everyone by wearing buckles on... their heads. ""Is that tight enough for you, Cotton?"" ""Yea, verily.” || I like the night life, I like to boogy. || My feeling is, we ran from animals for three million years. It’s our time now. If a cow could eat you, it would. And it wouldn’t care how comfortable your truck ride over was, either. || I work for a few at home who are devoted. People who are up now. Either they have some sort of bladder problem or they're extremely drunk. This is my crowd, these are the people I hope to get. || Wine me, dine me, Deep Space Nine me. || Whoo! Heidi! Little goat girl, you are kicking the jam. You've got my lederhosen in a situation. || I love animals. I couldn't eat a whole one but I'll split one with you if you want. || Let me tell you about Australia. It’s really, really, really, far from wherever you live on Earth. You fly and you fly and you fly. Then relativity takes over and you get younger and younger. And when you land, you’re a gleam in your father’s eye. || Good evening, I am The Proclaimers. || I have to hear this all the time in England: ""Well, all Americans are fat and stupid, mm-hm-hm-hm-hm."" Really? Well, thanks for sending over the best and brightest to start the party. Maybe we can send a few freaky, Texas, militia, hate-group, gun-toting weirdoes back to your country. || I understand that smoking is vaguely inappropriate in certain situations. You know, like an orphanage, cancer ward, whatever. || I think comedy should be left up to the professionals, that way everyone’s safety is protected. || Mm-mm, no, thank you, no, I don't want an enchilaaadaaa. Nor do I want a burr-eye-to. Or a tay-co. Or any other bizarre, unneccessary vowel substitutions. || In our world, all puns are beautiful and they are the highest form of comedy. || Today’s topic: premenstrual syndrome, the bastards that inflict upon women, earthquakes and stuff that falls down! || In the world of poop, there’s only one Proopster. I’m Greg Proops, the Amazing Pooper Scooper! || I just feel like history is very much alive and important and I don’t, you know, I can’t worry about whether people get it or not, per se. || I'm hoping in the next 30 years we'll end up in a beautiful world where we'll actually all are not the same but equal. || Purple and gold tigers don't really enter my world unless I've been up for a couple of days. || If you have a funny costume, you can't really wear it when you get older. || I see guys dressing like they're in college - and they're not. I don't want to be that guy. || Now, we're Americans. Technically, who is from this country? Only the Indians, who we graciously let dwell on their native casinos. || You sound heck-a-fun! || People are tired of this mainstream shit; television and radio is ghastly and the public can smell the corporate meeting. When you watch a show with Simon Cowell, you know no human touch has been near it, that they've carefully engineered the outcome and picked those they're going to humiliate. We live in an age of information glut, but so many people don't question what they're spoon-fed or bother to search for themselves. || I'm always looking for that place, you know, where there's no rednecks, that place where people get along, and I never find it. I went to Australia, right, and I thought Australia was gonna be a groovy, surfnoid, smoke-a-joint wombat, you know? 'G'day mate!' 'No worries!' And it's like Arkansas with a beach. It's a whole country with a 'No Fat Chicks' sticker on it. || I don't come on to seduce the audience. I don't care if everyone laughs. I can't think about that anymore. If there's anything that a lot of experience on stage and a lot of stage time gives you is the confidence to know that it's ok if they're not laughing every second you're up there. Although that's what drives me and I still go too fast a lot of the time. || You leave white people alone in constant isolation for thousands of years, you know what their musical contribution is going to be?… Riverdance. || It’s a Spice Girl party & since we’re missing one I’m the new one Specky Spice. || I don't want comedy to be Bridesmaids 2. I'm not denigrating Bridesmaids but, enough already, let's stop pretending women are incalculably different to us. Seeking out podcasts, listening on headphones, it's like an intimate, specific conversation. People respond if it feels from the heart. I'm as neurotic a human being as lives, and I have my faults. I'm a drunk. But people really like that. || Do ten or fifteen minutes up front of likeable material and then go to your vile self. || No one is a natural – you have to work at being a natural. || Tequila is like acid in a glass. || Whoo! Heidi! Little goat girl, you are kicking the jam. You've got my lederhosen in a situation. || I have a giant fish head on… I’m 42 fucking years old."
Hannibal Buress,"Whenever I eat at a restaurant I never put the napkin in my lap. People say, 'Hannibal, why don't you put the napkin in your lap?' Because I believe in myself. I believe in my ability to not spill food in my pants 'cause I'm a goddamn adult. And I've mastered the art of getting food from my plate to my mouth without messing up my jeans. You need to believe in yourself, too and get your life together, that's for babies. Have some confidence in your eating abilities and hand/eye coordination. || The jokes now, it’s just more stories and personal experiences. And just talking about things that really happened. It’s just becoming more comfortable as a performer, sharing my opinions on things, or things that’ve happened to me. That’s where it’s really going. || 'SNL' is the first real job I've held for more than a month and a half. || I don't believe in cancer walks. Well, I believe in them because they exist but I'd rather just give money straight up and save my Saturday afternoon. I can make my own t-shirt, that's not incentive. Plus I don't think cancer responds to how far people walk. I don't think cancer's sitting at home, 'What? How many people walked how far? How many people walked how far wearing the same shirt? That's crazy! I'm out of here!' Remission. || If you were scared of that movie then you had a easy life. || I like showing different types of comedy - showing that I could tell a story, or showing that I could do a one-liner, showing I could do stuff about music – so just trying to be versatile and talking about different topics. || Sometimes when I watch porn I get my hoodie on so I feel creepier. Sometimes I get under computer so it feels like I’m spying on her. || It’s fine if you want to be a feminist, but I think 5 AM after the bar closes is a weird time to jump on your soapbox. “Men just want to fuck.” It’s five in the morning, everybody wants to. That’s why they stayed out ‘til five because it didn’t happen at two. || I like burritos more than Jesus because steak burritos are delicious. And they’re real. || I applied for a job at Starbucks. One of the questions was, 'Why do you want to work at Starbucks?' Uh, because my life is in shambles. || My nephew's always crying. I'm like, 'Dude, why are you crying? Your life is great. All you do is eat apple sauce and take dumps. That's your day.' || I have weird aspirations. Like, I really want to kick a pigeon. || I’m a dumb guy. My point of view is limited. || There's a lot of dudes in my neighborhood that have handlebar mustaches. Which is cool if you want to have a handlebar mustache but don't try to have a conversation with me like you don't have a handlebar mustache. || I don't even know how to use a semicolon to this day; I use a comma every time. And you know what? If I email somebody and they get upset about me using a comma instead of a semicolon, that's not a person I want to work with anyway. And that's how you weed people out of your life. || I love stand-up. I look at it as a way to always stay productive. I couldn't imagine only being an actor or a writer. Because what the hell do I do when I'm not working? Mope? || My first regular comedy gig, I hosted an open mic in my college town… One show, I had an ex-girlfriend who showed up to perform. I had to introduce her to the stage. It was very awkward. “Coming to the stage is the cold-hearted bitch who broke my heart. You may know her for not returning my phone calls and also giving out mediocre blowjobs.” || I don't want to die before Will Smith 'cause then I miss that awesome 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' marathon. || If you want to do anything, you got to go do it. Perform a lot, write a lot, make yourself better. Use the Internet, make videos, create content. || Somebody said they were going to bring an 11-year-old to my show tonight. I'm not gonna tone it down for no 11-year-old. || I'd like to get more bit-acting roles. I don't know if my talent would allow for a long dialogue, but I could definitely knock out three lines. I'd kill it. || People like to compare something to something that they know. Even with Chris Rock, they say he's like Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy. || ""I'm a gangsta, and gangstas don't ask questions."" Yes they do ask questions! I thought that was a main point of being a gangster. ""Hey, muthafucka, where's my money?"" That's a question. ""Do you want to die tonight?"" That's a question too. ""What? What?"" That's two questions. || I was out with this girl; I bought some drinks. We went back to my hotel room, she starts throwing up the drinks that I bought all over the hotel room; it was very upsetting. It was like she was throwing up my money on my money. || In my hometown of Chicago, I'm kind of a medium deal. || I don’t really go to record stores much anymore. The internet has spoiled me. I’d rather just hit up iTunes. You never know what could happen when you go into a store - somebody might pull a Tonya Harding on you and break your knee cap. And now you got your knees all fucked up just ‘cause you wanted to get that vinyl. || I’ve been going up and bombing everywhere. It’s great. I love it. It’s hilarious. || God sounds kinda like a shitty father to me. If God was so powerful why’d he have to give his son up? It sounds like God owed someone some money and they couldn’t get to him, so they murked his son. That’s what I really think happened. Jesus got stabbed up in an alley… but it’s easier to sell crucifixes. You can’t sell a pendant of someone getting shanked up In the alley. It’s a marketing scheme. || I can work as a writer, but I wanted to do stand-up. And I knew I could, at worst, work as a stand-up. And I like to travel, and I knew I wanted to do an hour special, so in order to get ready for that, I had to hit the road. || I know some of you got upset when I called that woman a cunt, but someone steals over a thousand dollars from me I call ‘em what the fuck I want. || Was coming out of the store earlier, I just bought some Oreos and some Chips Ahoy. So I get outside, there's this guy like, 'Hey brother, it's my birthday today.' And that was the first time in my life, without any sarcasm, I could say, 'What? You want a cookie or something?' Because any other time you say that, you being mean, but I meant it from my heart. 'How many cookies you want, man? You want seven cookies? That's way too many cookies. You're being ridiculous right now. You can take, like, three or four cookies and get out of my face. Otherwise you're taking advantage of my generosity.' || ""We'll keep you in our thoughts"" With the other bullshit in your heads? No, keep me out of your thoughts, because I hear some of the stuff you talk about and if that's close to what you're thinking about, I don't want to be around that, so keep me and my family out of your thoughts, unless you're thinking of making me a sandwich. || I don't like when people say, 'I'll pray for you. I'm going to pray for you. Praying for you.' You're going to pray for me? So you're going to sit at home and do nothing? 'Cause that's what your prayers are; you doing nothing while I struggle with a situation. Don't pray for me - make me a sandwich or something. || Don’t thank the lord, I gave you that compliment… Thank me. || Come to your place at 5 in the monrning, eat your food, drink your drinks, leave at 6:30 without fucking like it’s cool. That’s a passive burglary. || Rap videos confuse me cause they have to be continued at the end but the never make a sequel. Where’s the second video? There’s so much suspense! I need to know are they goin keep pourin champagne on these bitches? What’s going to happen to that guy’s rims? Are they big enough for him? || When people go through something rough in life, they say, ""I'm taking it one day at a time."" Yes, so is everybody. Because that's how time works. || We got interns at the job. You can just tell them to do stuff. You gotta be nice, though. I had this cat fax something. I handed him a couple of pages, and I handed him another page. I said, 'Hey, man, fax something for yourself, too.' || I’ve been doing stand-up longer than I’ve been doing anything. It’s just learning how to act on camera, trying to get better at that, figuring out how to make my humor translate and bounce off other people. It’s not a big challenge, but the main thing is just trying to be on point and be the best I can be on these shows. || There have been times I’ve been out, and my phone battery is at nine percent, and I was like, ‘Time to go home.’ || We were talking about urban youth. And by urban I mean lives in a city not urban as in black like white people use it. || Sometimes I get drunk and I get into arguments with taxi drivers. And I get out the cab and I slam the door. That's not the way to win an argument with a taxi driver. The way to win is you get out of the cab and you leave the door open."
Henny Youngman,"I take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back. || She got her good looks from her father. He's a plastic surgeon. || Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays. || A Jewish woman had two chickens. One got sick, so the woman made chicken soup out of the other one to help the sick one get well. || This is an elegant hotel! Room service has an unlisted number. || My best friend ran away with my wife, and let me tell you, I miss him. || When you battle with your conscience and lose, you win. || Dancing on pointe...

Only this time, I stayed in the bathroom and cried. || Where did you get your haircut, the pet shop? || During the war an Italian girl saved my life. She hid me in her basement in Cleveland. || A priest is sent to Alaska. A bishop goes up to visit one year later. The bishop asks, ""How do you like it up here?"" The priest says, ""If it wasn't for my Rosary, and 2 martinis a day, I'd be lost. Bishop, would you like a martini?"" ""Yes."" ""Rosary, get the bishop a martini!"" || A guy complains of a headache. Another guy says, ""Do what I do. I put my head on my wife's bosom, and the headache goes away."" The next day, the man says, ""Did you do what I told you to?"" ""Yes, I sure did. By the way, you have a nice house!"" || A Polish terrorist was sent to blow up a car. He burned his mouth on the exhaust pipe! || A doctor says to a man ""You want to improve your love life? You need to get some exercise. Run ten miles a day."" Two weeks later, the man called the doctor. The doctor says ""How is your love life since you have been running?"" ""I don't know, I'm 140 miles away!"" || Someday you'll go to far, and I hope you'll stay there. || My doctor grabbed me by the wallet and said ""Cough!"" || I had a nightmare last night. I dreamed Dolly Parton was my mother and I was a bottle-baby. || I went to the bank and reviewed my savings. I found out I have all the money I’ll ever need if I die tomorrow. || A car hit a Jewish man. The paramedic says, ""Are you comfortable?"" The man says, ""I make a good living."" || Someone stole all my credit cards, but I wont be reporting it. The thief spends less than my wife did. || A self-taught man usually has a poor teacher and a worse student. || She's been married so many times she has rice marks on her face. || The secret of a happy marriage remains a secret. || If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. || Why don't you go to a window and lean out too far? || I know a man in Ft. Worth with 100,000 head of cattle. No bodies, just heads. || Doctor, I have a ringing in my ears. ""Don't answer!"" || My horse was so late getting home, he tiptoed into the stable. || The Doctor says ""You'll live to be 60."" ""I am 60!"" ""See, what did I tell you?"" || I was walking down the street, and I found a man's hand in my pocket. I asked ""What do you want?"" ""A match."" ""Why didn't you ask me?"" ""I don't talk to strangers."" || Doctor says to a man ""You're pregnant!"" The man says ""How does a man get pregnant?"" The doctor says ""The usual way, a little wine, a little dinner..."" || She has a wash and wear bridal gown. || If you had your life to live over again, do it overseas. || My wife is the sweetest, most tolerant, most beautiful woman in the world. This is a paid political announcement. || You look like a talent scout for a cemetery. || A little man is running a jewelry store. A man runs in saying, ""Okay, take my watch, put on a new band, install a new battery, clean the case, install a new crystal, and tune it up. I will be back in a half hour for it. Thanks!"" and runs out the door. The little jeweler says, ""C-C-C-Come in?"" || You have a ready wit. Tell me when it's ready. || This man used to go to school with his dog. Then they were separated. His dog graduated! || If my mother knew I did this for a living, she'd kill me. She thinks I'm selling dope. || A man calls a lawyer's office. The phone is answered, ""Schwartz, Schwartz, Schwartz and Schwartz."" The man says, ""Let me talk to Mr. Schwartz."" ""I'm sorry, he's on vacation."" ""Then let me talk to Mr. Schwartz."" ""He's on a big case, not available for a week."" ""Then let me talk to Mr. Schwartz."" ""He's playing golf today."" ""Okay, then, let me talk to Mr. Schwartz."" ""Speaking."" || The horse I bet on was so slow, the jockey kept a diary of the trip. || A doctor gave a man six months to live. The man couldn't pay his bill, so he gave him another six months. || My wife ran after the garbage truck, yelling, ""Am I too late for the garbage?"" ""No, jump in!"" || My wife has a keen sense of humor. The more I humor her, the better. || Don't move! I want to forget you just the way you are. || I thought talk was cheap until I saw our telephone bill. || My wife has a black belt in shopping. || A Polish man in a helicopter. Goes up to 800 feet. Down it comes! What happened? ""It got chilly up there, so I turned off the fan!"" || Two Santa Clauses on the corner. How can you tell the Polish one? The one with the Easter basket. || Just think, if it weren't for marriage, men would go through life thinking they had no faults at all. || Have you seen the new Polish jigsaw puzzle? One piece. || I have terrible luck. Last week my chauffeur ran off without my wife. || A woman was taking a shower. There is a knock on the door. ""Who is it?"" ""Blind man!"" The woman opens the door. ""Where do you want these blinds, lady?"" || My brother-in-law had to give up his last job because of illness. His boss became sick of him. || I don't mind when my horse is left at the post. I don't mind when my horse comes up to me in the stands and asks, ""Which way do I go?"" But when the horse I bet on is at the $2 window betting on another horse in the same race... || Everytime I ask what time it is, I get a different answer. || A hooker stopped me on the street and told me 'I'll do anything for $50.' I said, 'Paint my house.' || So I said, ""Where do you want to go for your anniversary?"" She said: ""I want to go somewhere I've never been before."" I said, ""Try the kitchen."" || My wife told me the car wasn't running well. There was water in the carburettor. I asked where the car was, and she told me it was in the lake. || If a joke is too hard to visualize, I tell the young comics, then what the hell good is it? || My wife is on a diet. Coconuts and bananas. She hasn’t lost any weight, but she can sure climb a tree. || My wife’s an earth sign. I’m a water sign. Together we make mud. || My horse's jockey was hitting the horse.

She's fast and he's hideous. || I've been in love with the same woman for forty-one years. If my wife finds out, she'll kill me. || I know a man who doesn't pay to have his trash taken out. How does he get rid of his trash? He gift wraps it, and puts in into an unlocked car. || This man is frank and earnest with women. In Fresno, he's Frank and in Chicago he's Ernest. || Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman who'll give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you're in the wrong house, that's what it means. || You have a nice personality, but not for a human being. || How to drive a guy crazy: send him a telegram and on the top put 'page 2.' || When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading. || I played a lot of tough clubs in my time.

I stepped on a rake. || I once wanted to become an atheist, but I gave up - they have no holidays. || I went out with a girl last night. She wasn't a Lana Turner. She was more of a stomach turner. || I just finished my income tax forms. Who says you can't get wounded by a blank? || I came home, the car was in the dining room. ""How did you get the car in here?"" ""Easy, I took a left at the kitchen."" || This guy asked his doctor, 'Will I be able to play the piano after my operation?' And the doctor says 'Sure.'

If I let go, she shops. || My wife is a light eater - as soon as it's light, she starts to eat. || I don't fly on account of my religion. I'm a devout coward. || The course of true golf never did run smooth. || I told my mother-in-law my house is your house. So she sold it. || She must have Egyptian blood.

Finally, I let her out. || I was so ugly when I was born, the doctor slapped my mother. || My wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met. || A kiss is the shortest distance between two. || The patient says ""Doctor, it hurts when I do this."" ""Then don't do that!"" || Look at him, sex takes a holiday! || I'm paid to make an idiot out of myself. Why do you do it for free? || I'd like to say we're glad you're here - I'd like to say it... || He was born on April 2. A day late. || If you have your life to live over again, don't do it. || He had a defect, which to a comic might be fatal. He wasn't funny. || I'll never forget my first words in the theatre.

Last week she learned how to aim it. || My wife drives the wrong way on a one way street. The cop pulled her over and asked, ""Where are you going?"" My wife said, ""I must be late, everyone is all coming back!"" || My brother then bought 1000 Japanese cameras. They all go, ""Crick"". || My son is 21. He'll be 22 if I let him. || A Polish man had a bandage on each ear. What happened? ""I was ironing, and the phone rang!"" ""What about the other ear?"" ""Had to call the doctor!"" || Are you Polish? Okay, I'll talk slower. || A Polish man bought a zebra for a pet. What does he call the zebra? Spot! || My wife loves to shop at Bloomingdale's. I bring her mail there twice a week. || All my wife does is shop - once she was sick for a week, and three stores went under. || Losing a wife can be very hard. In my case, it was almost impossible. || I own a hundred and fifty books, but no bookcase. Nobody will lend me a bookcase. || I played a great horse yesterday! It took seven horses to beat him. || Now, the band that inspired that great saying ""Stop the music!"" || What's the use of happiness? It can't buy you money. || My dad was the town drunk. Most of the time that's not so bad; but New York City? || I know a guy who had his doctor say ""take some weight off, go to a health club."" This man lost 20 pounds in one week! The machine tore his leg off! || I've kissed so many women I can do it with my eyes closed. || A man says to another man, 'Can you tell me how to get to Central Park?' The guy says no. 'All right,' says the first, 'I'll mug you here.' || I've been married for 49 years. Where have I failed? || She was at the beauty shop for two hours. That was only for the estimate. || Those bellhops in Miami are tip-happy. I ordered a deck of playing cards and the bellboy made fifty-two trips to my room. || I was just in London - there is a 6-hour time difference. I'm still confused. When I go to dinner, I feel sexy. When I go to bed, I feel hungry. || A bum asked me ""Give me $10 till payday."" I asked ""When's payday?"" He said ""I don't know, you're the one who is working!"" || The room is so small, when I put the key in, I broke the window! || The more I think of you, the less I think of you. || My brother then opened a tall man's shop in Tokyo. || Another drunk goes up to a parking meter, puts in a quarter, the dial goes to 60. The drunk says, ""Huh. I lost 100 pounds!"" || Is that your hat or are you wearing a cabana? || He gives his wife something to look forward to - a divorce. || I don't believe in reincarnation, but what were you when you were alive? || Last night I ordered a whole meal in French. Even the waiter was amazed - it was a Chinese restaurant! || An Israeli soldier who just enlisted asked the Commanding Officer for a 3 day pass. The CO says, ""Are you crazy? You just join the Israeli army, and you already want a 3 day pass? You must do something spectacular for that recognition!"" So the soldier comes back a day later in an Arab tank! The CO was so impressed, he asked, ""How did you do it?"" ""Well, I jumped in a tank, and went toward the border with the Arabs. I approached the border, and saw an Arab tank. I put my white flag up, the Arab tank put his white flag up. I said to the Arab soldier, ""Do you want to get a 3 day pass?"" So we exchanged tanks! || It's not true that married men live longer than single men. It only seems longer. || Americans are getting stronger. Twenty years ago, it took two people to carry ten dollars' worth of groceries. Today, a five-year-old can do it. || In high school football, the coach kept me on the bench all year. On the last game of the season, the crowd was yelling, ""We want Youngman! We want Youngman!"" The coach says, ""Youngman - go see what they want!"" || A man goes to a barbershop and asks, ""How many ahead of me?"" ""Five."" The man leaves. He comes back the next day and asks, ""How many ahead of me?"" ""Four."" The man leaves. He comes back the next day and asks, ""How many ahead of me?"" ""Six."" The man leaves, and the barber says to another, ""Follow that man!"" The man comes back and says, ""He goes to your house!"" || He is the only man I ever met with a seersucker face. || The Doctor called Mrs. Cohen saying ""Mrs. Cohen, your check came back."" Mrs. Cohen answered ""So did my arthritis!"" || This man dresses like an unmade bed. || Two Jewish women in New York, one says, ""Do you see what's going on in Poland?"" The other says ""I live in the back, I don't see anything."" || I've got two wonderful children - and two out of five isn't too bad. || Nurse: ""Doctor, the man you just gave a clean bill of health to dropped dead right as he was leaving the office"". Doctor: ""Turn him around, make it look like he was walking in."" || I wanted to do something nice so I bought my mother-in-law a chair. Now they won't let me plug it in. || My wife dresses to kill. She cooks the same way. || Take my wife... Please! || I'm now making a Jewish porno film. 10% Sex, 90% guilt. || In a blackout, a Polish man was stuck on an escalator for two hours. I asked him ""Why didn't you walk down?"" He said, ""because I was going up!"" || A little Jewish Grandma is at the Florida coast with her little Jewish Grandson. The grandson is playing on the beach when a big wave comes and washes the kid out to sea. The lifeguards swim out, bring him back to shore, the paramedics work on him for a long time, pumping the water out, reviving him. They turn to the Jewish Grandma, and say, ""we saved your grandson."" The little Jewish Grandma says, ""He had a hat!"" || A person asked me, ""How do you prepare for the stage?"" I told her, ""Well, it's like this. You go to diction school. They teach you to fill your mouth with marbles and talk right through the marbles. Each day you take one marble out. When you've lost all your marbles...""  || Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is finished. || I haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months - I don't like to interrupt her. || A polish man had his vasectomy done at Sears. Now when he makes love, the garage door goes up. || I was playing golf. I swung, missed the ball, and got a big chunk of dirt. I swung again, missed the ball, and got another big chunk of dirt. Just then, 2 ants climbed on the ball saying, ""Let's get up here before we get killed!"" || My wife and I went to a hotel where we got a waterbed. My wife called it the Dead Sea. || I bought my wife a little Italian car. A Mafia. It has a hood under the hood. || You have the Midas touch. Everything you touch turns to a muffler. || I've got all the money I'll ever need, if I die by four o'clock. || Two guys in a gym, one putting on a girdle. One guys says, 'Since when have you been wearing a girdle?' Other guy says, 'Since my wife found it in the glove compartment of our car.' || My wife will buy anything marked down. Last year she bought an escalator. || A drunk was in front of a judge. The judge says ""You've been brought here for drinking."" The drunk says ""Okay, let's get started."" || Why do Jewish divorces cost so much? They're worth it. || How do Polish people spell farm? E-I-E-I-O || Why does the New Italian navy have glass bottom boats? To see the Old Italian Navy! || Just got back from a pleasure trip: I took my mother-in-law to the airport. || A man goes to a psychiatrist. The doctor says ""You're crazy"" The man says ""I want a second opinion!"" ""Okay, you're ugly too!"" || I miss my wife's cooking - as often as I can. || My wife and I got remarried. Our divorce didn't work out. || My other brother-in-law died. He was a karate expert, then joined the army.

Henry Cho,"I'm going old school. Adult comedy but you can have your kids in the room. Kind of Andy Griffith meets Bill Cosby meets Bob Newhart. Also my character isn't an idiot as all the rest of the sitcoms recently have the dad character like Homer Simpson. || I’m an Asian with a Southern accent. To a lot of people, that right there is funny. || So, I’m from the South. So I guess that makes me South Korean. || My comedy is for adults, but you can have your kids listen to it. They won't get all the jokes because hopefully I'm more cerebral than a 10-year-old... but if you ask my wife, I'm not! || My wife gets mad because we'll be in the middle of something and I'll stop and say, 'No, I've got to write this down!' She'll say, 'No! We're in a discussion!' I say, 'I know, but it's hilarious!' || I think my one of my strengths in standup is my ability to adlib. I do all my best writing on stage. I can sit down and write jokes, but I'd rather go on stage with a premise or an idea and let the jokes come that way. My creative juices are never flowing any better than when I'm onstage. || In the early days I was on the road 45-50 weeks a year, driving from gig to gig 6-8 weeks in a row. Not everyone can do that. The show becomes the easy part. Tt's the life on the road that is the hardest... and you can't get any good at standup unless you do the road. || I pride myself on never using a cuss word on stage. Ever. I headline in Las Vegas every year, and this summer I am performing on an Alaskan cruise. Not too many comedians can pull that off. Funny thing is, my show doesn’t change for Vegas. || I’m smart cause I’m Korean, I’m not so smart cause I’m from the south. They cancel each other out, so I’m even. || Growing up, I loved Bill Cosby and Bob Newhart. They are a big reason I’m a storyteller because they are two of the best. || As a comedian, I have the gift of looking at something a bit differently and making it funny. I’m not sure why I can do that, but that’s as simple as I can put it. || College is great. It’s the only time in life where you can write a check for 39 cents... and bounce it. || Comedy today is definitely skewed to the filthy side, but it’s not as hard today as I am more mature as a comedian and a person. I’m a grown up now doing a kid’s job. Being a more mature Christian these days makes it easier than when I first started. Now I get to do shows of my choosing and a lot of folks attending the shows know my work and expect a clean show. || My way of telling stories is kind of what I do naturally. It's no different from how I would talk to you if you were in my living room. || My show is an adult comedy show, but it isn’t offensive. Your kids could listen to it, even though I hope they wouldn’t ‘get’ most of it. But I get a lot of fan mail from soccer moms saying ‘I love having your CD because I can listen to it with my kids in the car.’ || My comedy is adult humor, but clean. It’s not campy. I’ve always worked in the mainstream and I’ve never billed myself as a “Christian comedian.” I’m just a comedian who’s a Christian. || I have one show biz picture in my house. It's with Mr. Hope. I have asked for one autograph in my life: Mr. Hope's. || Guys take care of your wife when she’s pregnant. Don’t say stupid stuff either, like me. I came home one time. My wife’s six months pregnant. She’s lying on the couch. There’s food and clothes everywhere. And I walked in and went, “What’d you do today?” Don’t do that. My wife looked up and said, “Today? I don’t know, Henry. Let’s see… what did I do today? Today I made a lung.” || My wife at times will say I'm stubborn, selfish, insensitive, vague, deaf at times, blah, blah, blah... but she's never said I was boring! || My family is number one in my life. I'll blow off writing or just about anything to make sure I take my son to preschool or watch him at his swimming lesson. || Sharks attack surfers because they look like a seal. Apparently, when you’re layng on your board and you have your arms and legs hanging off, from underneath you look like a seal. So I just got a picture of a seal and put a red line through it and put it underneath my board. || My standup has always been a direct reflection of my life. When I was single, I talked about single stuff. I talked about dating. When I got married there were only a handful of stories I could move over to where I wasn't going to be disrespectful to my wife. So I developed a new routine. || Their cousin got in a fight and they put him in jail. I had to go get him out. He came walking out going, 'Hey, man, I tried to call you on the cellphone.' I said, 'You don't have a cellphone.' He goes, 'I mean, the phone by the cell.'"
Howie Mandel,"I needed time to stand back and go through a lot more experience in life. Then I have something to write about, joke or to animate. || My whole life is a practical joke. Every evening and every show has really become about entertaining me. I was always like that. And now I've come full circle because that's what the TV show is too. || We don't want to make them uncomfortable. It doesn't seem like anybody seems to be uncomfortable. We seem to get along. || Terry was so angry; she kept saying we have to meet with these people at parent-teacher conferences. But in the midst of this anger, I realized there's something funny about the way these pieces affect my life, and I realized there was a show in this, a hybrid where you could see the hidden cameras juxtaposed with this normal domestic life that I lead. || People who annoy people are the luckiest people in the world. || I was never brave before. I always tried to make it work. Now I have nothing to lose except some cash, and it's just not that important to me. I've never been allowed up until now to remain who I am, or true to what my life is like. || Everything runs its course. We had told a lot of stories that happened in our life. My kid was getting older, and we were running out of stories to tell. || I am beloved by millions. || She was so helpful and so sweet and so giving. I call it the food-poisoning effect. Everybody knows where they got food poisoning. We take that first bite and there's kind of an awful taste or a bad smell. You knew it was a little off, but you just kept going. || I'm fascinated by mankind. I grew up watching 'Candid Camera' and thought it was funnier than any standup, any joke, anything that could possibly be written because you're dealing with humanity. And people can relate to that. It touches everybody who sees it. It hits a nerve. || I've been chased. I've been pushed. I've been screamed at. I've been verbally abused. I've been afraid for my safety. But I did it all in the name of entertainment. || I was totally involved in Bobby's World from the time we started the idea to sitting with the artists on how he would look, to the script meetings, the music, the lyrics, the songs. || You can go home with a lot of money with absolutely no skill. || I've had people come up to me, as home viewers, and tell me they were screaming at the TV, yelling at each other, yelling at the contestants. || It's heart-wrenching because they often need the money. || The success of any stand-up act comes out of life experience. || When I went into Bobby's World, I had no idea it would be a success. I had been doing the Bobby voice as part of my nightclub adult act for years. || If my mom came here today, she'd probably join this red-hat brigade. My mother got my sense of humor, even when I was a kid. I would just do things that tickled my fancy in the moment, and she would ask me who I was entertaining. I'd say, 'Well, me.' And she would tell me that nobody knew that and they thought I was psychotic. Well, I don't ever want people to think I'm psychotic, but I can't help myself from doing these things. || We get up early Sunday morning, and we have cereal and orange juice and we make crank calls. || Bobby's World touched a lot of people. That's why the family's last name is Generic. Uncle Ted is based on uncles we've all had. || Now I have new stories and I feel refreshed. There is talk of Bobby's World eventually coming back. I would be happy to do that. || It's really not that hard. If I do a Tonight Show, it's six or seven minutes. If I do a concert, it's 90 minutes. If I do an interview, that's 15 minutes. So by the end of the day I've done three hours worth of work. || There were 84 original episodes. It was rated No. 1 and No. 2 on the Fox Children's Network. We figured it was time to make it available to people who have never watched it. || My point of reference is life, in everything that I do. || You release these things, and if they fly then you have more. || I'm from Canada, so Thanksgiving to me is just Thursday with more food. And I'm thankful for that. || We sat down and told stories that happened to us in our childhood, to our children. They were all basically based on the truth. These stories were funny and poignant to us. They just took off. These are all stories from my life. || We were a very small circle of writers. Everybody brought to the table their own life experience. || I was the voice of Bobby. So while I was doing the show, I was also a father. It did reflect how I tried to handle things in my own home. || There's no skill. You can be a rock and move into another cash bracket. || I thought that was funny, but nobody else did. I was mostly entertaining myself, though. My parents both had a great sense of humor, and always laughed a lot. One night, when they were watching Candid Camera, I finally understood what comedy was all about. I heard the laughter on television, I turned around and saw my parents laughing, and that's when I thought: 'This is great. This is what I can do. I'm gonna prank somebody.' || If I'm a game show host, will someone buy a ticket to see me do standup? To do a dramatic role in a movie? || We did it for nine years, No. 1, and the Fox Children's Network moved it into a different direction, of the Power Rangers and other stuff."
Iliza Shlesinger,"It feels amazing to just be here and be able to share my jokes with the world. It’s not so much about being a girl, it’s about being a funny comic. || You look like the kind of woman who dates guys in prision. || You know what happened the last time a group of people said, 'Screw it, we don't care what you think'? They got hung as witches. || You can’t go to the bathroom alone… you might not come back. Cause no girl’s ever been to the bathroom alone and survived. It’s true. The last woman that attempted it, it was 1937 and her name was Amelia Earhart. || I don't hate other women. Let me rephrase that: I hate other women and men - people in general can be annoying - but I've never disliked a woman for being beautiful. || Passion always finds a way. Follow your passion and everything else will work out. || When you ask a girl out and she suggest a bar, you're answer shouldn't be ""great, I like that bar and they'll have the Rockets game on too."" || I don’t come up with ideas, they come to me. I write them down and try to convey what's wrong with me to the audience as best I can. || I always wished my dad was there to intimidate my boyfriends or something. It's supposed to be your dad giving your guys friends the stink-eye for sneaking beer through your house, not your mom. || I don’t tend to like race jokes. I don’t like Jew jokes and black jokes, and they make me very uncomfortable, probably because I’m both. Well, I’m not black - but if I was then I could dance better. || Ladies, just know that when you grow your hair too long, you got about two inches difference between really hot, sexy supermodel - religious fanatic. Hot Maxim cover girl everybody wants a mouth kiss - unhealthy faith in your lord. Soft, silky, shiny hair everyone wants to touch - one of 12 brides. || If I could have any job I would be a cat… but that’s not something I’m supposed to talk about in public. || There are two types of men: those who are intimated by a girl like me, and those who are not. You don't have to like me, but you don't have to be a dick about it. And after a lifetime of dealing with this, I'm pretty well-equipped, verbally, to cut anyone down at any time. || You're not a road comic till you've watched Real Sex and American Greed alone in your hotel room. || I grew up watching and admiring Adam Sandler, it started with “Saturday Night Live and his albums, then I became a huge fan of his movies. “SNL”, “Kids in the Hall,” and “In Living Color” – their characters were huge influences and eye openers to other worlds of comedy for me. || Both are salty, one will give me carpal tunnel, I’ll go with the fries. || As a comedian, as an entertainer, there's a lot of downtime. Once you can accept that comedy is a marathon, not a sprint, it gets a little easier. || I wasn't a 'hot chick' in high school. I was 'funny' and a tomboy and probably a little uncomfortable with my amazing boobs. || Everyone has their personal topics. My comedy has always been very strong on observational humor, it stems from what I see every day in my life. || When you're missing your two front teeth, that's honesty. That is a door to your oral history. You're not covering anything up. You're saying, 'Hey world, I'm missing my front teeth. I'm gross; I'm dirty; I'm poor. I clearly have no problem with public urination and eating garbage. Don't come near me, I'll gum you to death!' || The weekend represents the 48 hours that you have to fuck up the life you worked so hard for all week. || Most modern girls don’t really know what hiking is. To the average girl, hiking is: you wake up whenever you want; you put on Lululemon ‘cause they make your butt look unreasonably good - and they should for 800 fucking dollars - and you go for a walk in the park with your best friend and complain about how hungover you are. That’s hiking. || It’s our first date but I don’t want to go on a date. I wanted to do it in the daylight with animals so it couldn’t be misconstrued as anything in case he’s the worst. || It said, 'War Is Not the Answer.' I disagree. I think war absolutely is the answer. And if you don't agree with me, happy Fourth of July. || I was in New York last Christmas - it's snowing; there's a guy in a t-shirt. I'm like, 'Dude, aren't you cold?' 'No, I'm from New York. I don't get cold.' Just 'cause you're from a cold place doesn't mean you're genetically predisposed to not feeling cold. You're not a penguin. I was like, 'In fact, sir, you're Puerto Rican, so if anything, you should be more cold.' || I didn’t “date” in college, I kind of always had a boyfriend. Just because I make jokes on a dating show doesn’t mean I’m Carrie Bradshaw. || I'm not even 1000% sure that polar bears exist. How do you know? Why, 'cause Coca-Cola puts them on their can during Christmas? They also put Santa Claus, what's your fucking point? || When you get off stage, the audience should know a little bit about you. Not where you are from, but how you see the world. And that’s the difference between like a Chris Rock joke, and like an open-miker. || This isn’t a bra, it’s body armor. And this isn’t make up, it’s war paint. || Never laugh at your significant other when they're having an orgasm. That is their time to shine. || I learned this one growing up in Texas and, subsequently, living in Los Angeles: always use the 'usted' form when speaking to a Spanish official. Mexican border patrol cops don't like it when you call them 'amigo,' give them a hardy pat on the back, slip a $20 in their pocket. No bueno, it doesn't fly. By the way, those of you not laughing at that obviously took French in high school, and that was a gay choice."
J. B. Smoove,"Peeps ask why the shades inside JB? I have a cool prescription thats why! || Father's Day just be Mother's Day the sequel. || I don't like to dabble in anything I don't do well. I don't talk politics. || Just broke up with somebody. Well, it wasn't really a break up, it was a booty call I might have took too serious. || I did a club one night - the speakers were old as hell. My jokes were coming out in black and white. || Sometimes, when you get a girl pregnant, you blame the condom. His condom broke that night. || My wife and I have been together for 11 years, and seven of those married. We got married on 07/07/07. We support each other 150 percent. We have fun. We are a modern-day Sonny & Cher. I don’t sing. My wife sings. We’re so different, but so alike. We got that ying and yang thing going on. You see it, but you don’t know how it works. || When you're babysitting a kid, all you're seeing is a version of them, a small dosage. || You don't want to take the world over with a whole hamper full of dirty clothes. That's the main thing people overlook. And take a shower, take a bath every day. || I have my website, The Ruckus, which is an Internet site, similar to the Funny or Die format, where people post funny videos. I get a chance to rate their videos; they get a chance to blog and kick it with me. || It's not even race; it's a certain type of person that gets 'Pootie Tang.' || I was the hallway clown in high school. || True Yankees fans know an up-and-coming player when they see one. || Being a parent is about your survival. Surviving the terrible two's is the most important thing. || I'm trying to be the Jay-Z of comedy one day. I don't know if there's any comedy moguls out there, but I would love to be the first comedy mogul. || If a director brings a guy to their movie who does improv, they've got to let him do what he does - otherwise it's like bringing Michael Jordan to your basketball team and telling him to just pass the ball and don't shoot. || Curb Your Enthusiasm set me up so perfectly. That was one of my favorite shows before I got on it. That started a whole different level of a story for me. I didn’t know how to process it until after I got on the show and realized what the purpose of it was. || I try to dress smooth, I try to keep my face shaved, I try to keep my head cut. I try to do all the things to keep it smooth going! || There're rules to being the side chick. Rule number one: you're number two. || I love to pitch things that I believe in and products that I love to use. || Comedians are therapists. People honestly think we’re doing it for ourselves. No. If we wanted to do stand-up for ourselves, we would perform in front of a mirror and never go to a club. We are giving this away. Some people are going through so much in their lives, they want to hear something else that’s going on in the world and laugh. || I am the comedy version of ambidextrous. I’m working with my left and right hand. I’m the two-sided coin. I’m all of those metaphors you can think of. I’m the interracial couple. I’m BET and CBS. || White people think they can just do what the fuck they want to do all the time! || I'm putting on a suit and tie when I go see ""The Great Gatsby"". || Sometimes you can make friends, and sometimes you can take friends. Sometimes people want to be friends with you, and you gotta be like, 'Okay, I can deal with this person's personality and be their friend, but not necessarily do I have to change who I am. I'm not gonna change myself to be their friend.' || Improv relies just as much on listening as it does you delivering dialogue. That's the hard for some people. Some people just concentrate on what they're going to say, and they're not listening. You have to listen in order to see where the other person is going to. || I'm, like, everybody's friend. I'm one of those dudes. I can be friends with anybody. Any race of person, any personality, I can kind of deal with them. I accept different types of people. || I would only take a role that I know I'm comfortable in and I can do. I've turned down plenty of things because I'd feel it's not me, and I wouldn't want to come on someone's project and flip that. || Women put guys through tests all the time. || Remember Tupperware? That was the toughest stuff ever. Why can't they make a phone out of Tupperware? || Oh, yeah, I've seen 'Seinfeld' 1,000 times. || My life is gardening, cleaning around the house and power washing. || I wish black people had a flag they could put into the ground, like when the troops stormed Iwo Jima. || Live TV has an amazing pace to it. You've got to be able to think quick, make changes last minute, and be funny and fast. || Damn! This flight attendant treating us like we won these first class tickets in a contest. || My mother is old, but she jokes around. She lives in a senior living home. After a certain age some people don’t like joking. They take her sarcasm the wrong way. I get that from my family. Everybody talks over each other. The first time I took my wife to my family reunion, she said, “I don’t know what’s going on. I can’t do this!” || I may even show up behind the camera. I love to put things together; I love to give direction. I have a great eye for pace. || You know how you put peanut butter on a piece of bread and the bread falls - it never falls on the bread side down, it always falls peanut butter side down. That's because of gravity. || I never write jokes, I just try to make myself laugh. || I wouldn't want to be someone's roommate, that's for sure. You can't do certain things: you can't leave the bathroom door open... you can't put your feet on the couch, you can't hide stuff in the couch. || I tell people all the time, as I was going through my process of being a comedian or being an actor and a writer at 'SNL,' I tell people that everything you do is all a piece of your puzzle to determine where you're going to end up at. || I can apply myself to the format of 'SNL,' I can apply myself to the format of 'Conan,' but at the same time, I'm still being J. B. Smoove. I'm not changing up my style, I'm not changing up how I think, what's funny to me, my delivery, the way I carry myself. || I loved Peter Sellers. I thought he was the perfect mix of physical comedy with out-of-the-box humor. I loved his tone; I loved his physicality; I loved everything about what he was doing as a comedic actor. || I'm sure back in the Greek days or the Roman Empire days, when guys fought in arenas and were fighting lions, people were talking smack. Every era in history has someone talking smack. No way you can have talent and not proclaim your victory. || If your boss asks you why you're comin' in late, you say it's 'cause you stayed late. || You want your lady to be a contortionist. What man wouldn't want a lady who's a contortionist? || People love things about Hollywood. People love to see the inside of what's going on. || You gotta improvise in life. You gotta improv if the police pull you over. || I'm street smart. You can't con me. But that's just from living in New York. Now if a guy came from Mississippi somewhere, Ohio somewhere, to New York City for the first time, he don't have the street smarts. You can take him. || My father always dressed nice, and he always wore shades and a hat. Plus he always wore shined shoes. He taught me: “Always get there before you get there.” That means always dress nice. Even if you’re not the most handsome man in the world, you must have handsome characteristics, such as a handsome personality and attitude. || You turn hotdogs with tongs. Don't you ever use those tongs on a hamburger. || You got to start by doing little things if your quest is to take over the world. || When I started stand-up, the first thing I did was to take an improv class. || I am addicted to hockey now. I've seen it on TV, but to be there? I had no idea that white people were having so much fun without me. || When you speak directly at things and don't say you're going to try to do something or that you hope to do something, the universe will work with you. Think about it this way - a boomerang goes out and comes back to you if you throw it. If you throw it out at the universe, it will come back down to you on Earth. || I'm big on facial expressions, and I'm big on mannerisms, which I find to be hilarious. || I steal scenes, I steal opportunities. I am the ultimate thief. I got sticky fingers, man. They all call me The Thief. || If I had signed my fourth season of SNL, I wouldn’t have ever had the opportunity to do Curb Your Enthusiasm. If my buddy OG Pearson wouldn’t have passed away, I wouldn’t have been in L.A. for his memorial, and I would’ve never auditioned for Curb. || 'The ruckus' is different experiences you go through throughout your life which builds your ruckus points up - your tolerance. You've got to have a high tolerance for dealing with stuff all the time. || You know what I like? I like classic stuff. I like 'The Andy Griffith Show' - the variety of characters was so amazing to me. || To be a true comic, you have to have a signature move. You ever watch wrestling? And your favorite wrestler has the one move that he always does to finish his opponent off, right? Like when he climbs on the rope, and he always jumps off the top rope and finishes off his opponent - that's what a comic has. || I should be European, man. I'm long and lean. I'd look good in a trench coat. || Let me tell about Tennessee. If your car breaks down in Tennessee, you have just moved to Tennessee. || Mel Gibson is losing it. I don't know how people still supporting this dude's movies like it's all good. That dude is nuts. All you gotta do is shut him down and don't support any of his movies. || It's great when a director like Cameron Crowe can take what you do and fit it into what he's doing. If someone's a fan of you already, they can take what you do and make it work for what they're doing. You don't know their vision, and you're thinking, 'How is this guy going to take what I do and make it work in this movie?' || I'm afraid one thing - I don't like heights. Heights bug me out. I'm not cool with heights. I refuse to do a comedy show 12 stories up. I'm fearless about everything else. || I'll drive down the street, and I'll practice improv. I will sit there at a red light and see two guys talking to each other, and I will just start playing both characters. I can't hear them, but I can see their mouths moving, so I'll just put words in their mouths. || I just always found it easier to be the same guy onstage as you are offstage. || I have big hands. I can't do the touch-screen thing. I'm a button guy. I want to press buttons. || I drive a big Dodge truck. I drive American cars. || I believe, even when I'm doing my standup or my acting or whatever I'm doing, I believe in painting pictures. || For me, standup will always be some part of my life, and other things will move around and find their place. || All you wanna do in life is do what you do well. That's when you're happiest. || A lot of comedians are selfish. || I thought 'Pineapple Express' was hilarious. || You can’t take everything that is offered to you. I pass on a lot of stuff, because I truly believe that I will shine better if I could do it 200 percent rather than do it 80 percent and make it so-so. || I admire Russell Simmons. He is a successful dude that has done a little bit of everything. He keeps it moving, and he’s still doing things. Larry David is also amazing. He is honest and blunt. A creative genius. || You buy a new iPhone, a few months later, another new iPhone comes out, and you get online to buy another one. You can't get enough. You are addicted to Apple. || When you’re learning, sometimes you make mistakes that help you be successful. It can be, realizing, “Oh, I did this wrong” or “I wasn’t affiliated with the right people.” Those things make you better. || That's what I am; I'm a drip. You still get hydrated, you still get your nutrients, just a little at a damn time.  || You can wait for things to happen for you or you can make things happen for you. || I quit my day job the day my daughter was born. I remember flying to Cleveland and hitting a thunderstorm, which caused the plane to lose pressure, and the oxygen masks fell from the ceiling. We felt the plane dropping; the pilot was taking it down to regain cabin pressure. My heart was in my stomach. I found out after landing that her mom was in labor. I did the show and came back to New York. By the time I walked into the hospital, my daughter was being born. She was waiting for me. She’s a sweet daddy’s girl. She’s premed. She has her own pie company. She works for Habitat for Humanity. || In my stand-up, I’ve always been loose. If there’s a curtain onstage, I’ll use that in my act. If there’s a door, I’ll use the door. I always like to use everything at my disposal, which makes each show a little different and a little more fun. || I've had jokes stolen a thousand times. But if you can do it better than me, you can have it. I've had jokes stolen from me in the club when I'm next on stage. And my brain will start to turn, and the gears will start turning, and I'll go onstage and create a whole new bit. || I think comedy evolves constantly. I reinvent myself all the time. I always find a way to entertain myself because I truly believe you have to entertain yourself in order to relate it the right way to your audience. || You're trying to make someone wet their pants and you're trying to make somebody crap in their pants. That's the motivation of a comic. Who else has that power? || I got the most expensive piece of paper on your wall that don't do shit. I'll tell you what I did with mine: I took it down, I shredded it, I stomped on it, and I shredded it to a nice, fine white powder and I snorted it like cocaine. I packaged the rest and sold it to some white girls. || Pursuing your dreams involves you accepting where you want to go. Don’t allow anybody else to talk you out of things or discourage you from doing whatever you want to do. You can hold on to your dream and never pursue it or you can start pursuing it. If you can see it, or if you can envision it... it can happen. || I've done everything. Selling door-to-door fire extinguishers... In bars, I used to repair those machines that have 10 different buttons on them to spray club soda and seltzer. || I’m on my version of the protein diet, but there ain’t no protein in it. It’s a Krispy Kreme doughnut between two Cinnabons. And you soak it overnight in Red Bull. Then you chase it with a Snickers. || This Italian restaurant I'm at is authentic! When they seat you, they give you a mustache. || When you're on stage performing stand-up, things only happen one time. I've done bits where I improv a joke, and people are dying. The next show, I try to repeat it, I can't do it. Because with the first audience that was our moment. It can't happen the same way again. We were all there: a certain type of people were at that show and we all got it. || Kids love me. I can bounce back and forth. I can discipline kids, and I can get into the mind of a kid. In my brain, I consider myself the ultimate video game player. The ultimate snack maker. || I was a beer boy in a bodega, where I was responsible for keeping the beer cold in the freezer. It was the heyday of Olde English 40 ounces. I also sold fire extinguishers. I used to put my foot in the door when people opened it. I would do a demonstration with newspaper on their dining room table. One time, I had done so many damn demos that my extinguisher didn’t have enough fluid in it after I started the fire. I grabbed the tray, threw it outside in the grass and stomped the fire out. The person was yelling; and I got in my car, leaving all of my equipment, and got the hell up out of there. || Believe it or not, I write on stage. I can't write anywhere else; I have to be in a moment. I also have to challenge myself to make something funny out of a premise. I never have my own jokes written. I have to change things as I go along, and I have to entertain myself. || It's an ongoing joke that a black man is always the first one to get killed in movies. || Before I got into stand-up, I used to be a hip-hop dancer in a crew, and my name was J. Smoove, and my partner was J. Groove. || I have to satisfy my audience. || There's book smart, there is street smart, there's relationship smart, there's too many different kinds of smarts to know all of them. Everybody doesn't know every kind of smart. There's money smart, there's movie smart, there's computer smart. There's just too many different kinds of smarts for people to know all the smarts. || I talked about everything, man. I’ve always written material that everyone can laugh at. I talked about growing up. I did a lot of physical comedy. That was my thing. I was a physical comedian. I did anything and everything from running on a treadmill, I can paint a picture on stage of anything. || Sad when you spend more time trying to stay alive than living. || You have to fail, man, but you cannot allow failure to stop you from doing what you must do. Failing is just as good as succeeding in a lot of ways. It’s how you react to it all. You can react to success the wrong way and be a total failure. Or you can react to losing with your whole heart, learn from it, and be a huge success. In stand-up, I’ve learned to know when I’m burning it up or when I’m being so-so. That’s experience. I learn every single time I’m on a stage. || The biggest scam I fell for was college. It got me. 'Cause I swear, in high school I was up $40; now I'm down $60,000. All my friends, 'Hey Nore, what was your major?' Bankruptcy, motherfucker. || Police blog or entertainment news, it's just good to see your name in print. || Some of the best dramatic actors have started in comedy. || I think what I do in my acting world and what I do in my standup world is bring up a brand that I want to bring across. Once you figure out your brand and what you do, it's kind of easy at that. You end up getting your audience. || When I first started doing comedy years ago, I used to be the biggest Michael Richards fan. I used to love this dude. He was on a TV show called 'Fridays,' and man, he was tall and lanky - and I was tall and lanky. I love physical comedy, and he was a physical comedian, and I said, 'Man, I love this guy.' || Look, anybody can tell a joke, so a lot of a comedian’s success is about energy and engagement. A real comic sells himself first and his joke second. So how do you do that? Get your swagger. Know what you’re doing. Be prepared. Be fresh. Be “on.” || I could never live with you; not 'cause I'm racist or nothing. It's just 'cause as a black man in America, I need to have someone I can come home and complain about white people to. And that just don't work with my white wife. || I live in New York right now but I'm originally from my daddy's nuts. We all are. Think about, we the lucky ones - we made it. You all are winners. That's the first race you ever won. || We came here to pick up chicks, not talk about dicks. || I most resemble Benjamin Button. I evolve. I attach myself to the heartbeat of whatever is going on at that particular time, or I just chart a new path. || It's 113 degrees in Phoenix!  Damn!!! I'm not as hot as I thought I was! || No matter what you’re doing in life, listen. Listen, wait, process it, then you open your mouth. Gather the information and then you reply. Anything else, you’re bound to fail. Anything you do, do it like that. When you don’t know how to deal with your lady, take an improv class. You can improv on her birthday. You can improv on your anniversary. You can improv in the bedroom. Can you imagine the skills you would have with your lady if you just listened better? Improv opens doors to everything. It’ll keep you from getting fired. It’ll keep you from getting a ticket. It’ll get you a nice time with your lady. Before you open your mouth, make sure you’ve listened. You can have anything you want in life.  || Man, you can come see me six or seven times in a row and you’ll never see the same show twice, because I don’t like to be robotic onstage. I like to perform for that particular audience. || I don’t consider myself a stand-up comedian. I consider myself a performer; a comic as opposed to stand-up comedian. Stand-up comedians stand there and do their bits; I break every rule in creation. If there’s a rule that can be broken in stand-up, I’ll do it. || When it's cold - I'll tell you what happens when it's cold: You get a lot of shit done and you get ladies pregnant. When it's hot, ladies will say, ""You're sweating, get the fuck off of me."" Ladies like doggie style in the summertime. Missionary style is more of a wintertime sexual position. Understand? || What happens in improv is you create your own storyline. || As far as standup, everybody has a vehicle they are driving. If what you do works, it’s like playing golf. If you can master that one swing over and over again, you will be successful. That’s what standup is. You have to have a central move and it has to be yours. You have to own your comedy, own what you do. || Keep it real by being straight forward. Don't pull no punches on people. It's better to tell somebody than just lollygag around, letting them think they're living their life the right way. Because some people don't know what the hell they're doing, they don't know if they're living the right way or making the right decisions. Some people don't know that. || Sometimes shit comes out your mouth that you don't expect! All you need is a goddamn witness. An audience is a goddamn witness. || You ever taste some damn chicken so horrible, that you wished the chicken would show up at your house and show your lady how to cook him?"
Jack Benny,"I went to see one of those X-rated pictures the other night, and I couldn't believe my eyes. So I stayed to see it a second time. || I don't deserve this award, but I have arthritis and I don't deserve that either. || I gambled at the crap table all night and finally lost $8, but during that time the house gave me four drinks and two cigars, so it was still a lot cheaper than renting a room. || Bill Paley is not only the greatest boss I ever had, but he's the most brilliant, honest and warm human being I've ever met. And I'll say that to his face - even if it costs me my job.  || Comedy itself is based upon very old principles of which I can readily name seven. They are, in short: the joke, exaggeration, ridicule, ignorance, surprise, the pun, and finally, the comic situation. || A scout troop consists of twelve little kids dressed like schmucks following a big schmuck dressed like a kid. || Hors D'oeuvre: A ham sandwich cut into forty pieces. || When they laugh at one of my jokes... it just gets me right here. || When another comedian has a lousy show, I'm the first one to admit it. || Last time I got a standing ovation was in England when I played with the London Philharmonic. I played the Wieniawski Concerto, and when I finished, the whole audience stood up - and walked out! || I'm happy to be making my first appearance on air professionally. By that I mean I'm finally getting paid, which I know will be a great relief to my creditors. || A rich man is one who isn't afraid to ask the salesperson to show him something cheaper. || Any man who would walk five miles through the snow, barefoot, just to return a library book so he could save three cents - that's my kind of guy. || I feel responsible for Johnny Ray's success. See many years ago I asked him to be on my show and he asked for a lot of money and I cried. And he stole that from me. || I'm living in a very modest place. I have a room over-looking beautiful Claridge's Hotel. I thought it was better than paying Claridge's prices and overlooking the dump I'm living in. || I don't want to tell you how much insurance I carry with the Prudential, but all I can say is: when I go, they go too. || When I give concerts, the tickets sell for five dollars to one hundred dollars, but for my concerts the five-dollar seats are down in front... the further back you go, the more you have to pay. The hundred-dollar seats are the last two rows, and those tickets go like hotcakes! In fact, if you pay two hundred dollars you don't have to come at all. || I began my show business career playing violin in San Francisco at the corner of Market and Taylor. I understand that there is a theater there now. || A cannibal is a guy who goes into a restaurant and orders the waiter. || I went into Claridge's for lunch the other day - all I ordered was a fruit salad and coffee, and I had to book another week at the Palladium. || The doctors couldn't find anything wrong with me except that I have a slight stomach pain. Wait till I get my hospital bill! Then I'll really have a pain the stomach! || The only way I'll ever get hurt in the casino is if there's an earthquake and a slot machine falls on my foot. || I'm like Will Rogers, I never met a man I didn't like... well, Eichmann maybe.  || I was going to buy my girl a Packard car for Christmas, but it took too long to deliver, so I bought her some handkerchiefs. || I went to a meeting for premature ejaculators. I left early. || Did you know ""execrable"" means ""lousy?"" || Age is strictly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. || Give me golf clubs, fresh air and a beautiful partner, and you can keep the clubs and the fresh air. || Hello, folks, this is Jack Benny. There will be a slight pause while everyone says, ""Who cares?"" || Nothing funny happened to me on the way to the theater tonight, so good night. || No matter how often I tell people I'm thirty-nine some of them refuse to believe I'm that old. || I'm an old newspaper-man myself, but I quit because I found there was no money in old newspapers. || I practice three hours daily on my violin so I won't get worse. || Gags die, humor doesn't. || Modesty is my best quality. || It's not so much knowing when to speak, when to pause. || I believe in being honest with myself. If there's one thing I hate it's when a comedian is great and won't admit it. I've never met one like that, but if I did, I'd hate them. || I was born in Waukegan a long, long time ago. As a matter of fact, our rabbi was an Indian. || It's a real Strad, you know. If it isn't I'm out one hundred and ten dollars. The reason I got it so cheap is that it's one of the few Strads made in Japan.  || I took my girl to dinner, and she laughed so hard at one of my jokes that she dropped her tray. || When you talk about the world's greatest entertainer you have to say Al Jolson because there was no one like him. Only Judy Garland and perhaps Frank Sinatra got anywhere near him! || My wife Mary and I have been married for forty-seven years and not once have we had an argument serious enough to consider divorce; murder, yes, but divorce, never. || I must be cheaper now than I was ten years ago in order to get a laugh. It's not funny now if I leave the table and give the waiter a nickel tip, which was a laugh years ago. Today I must maneuver it so that somehow I get the waiter to give me a nickel tip. || There's only five real people in Hollywood. Everyone else is Mel Blanc."
Jackie Mason,"I've got a friend who is half-Jewish and half-Italian. If he can't buy it wholesale, he steals it! || I've got another friend who is half-German and half-Polish. He hates Jews but can't remember why! || I've got another friend who is half-Polish and half-Jewish. He's a janitor, but he owns the building! || I always thought music was more important than sex - then I thought if I don't hear a concert for a year-and-a-half it doesn't bother me. || Ladies and gentlemen, you can't please everyone. Take my girlfriend - I think she's the most remarkable woman in the world... That's me... But to my wife... || When most people return from Europe, they tell tales of all the sites they saw, the shopping, the entertainment, etc. Jews, on the other hand, return and say ""I had this slice of cake in Austria, let me tell you, I don't know how they make it! It was great!"" || The pamphlet uses my name, my likeness, my 'shtick' (if you will), and my very act, which is derived from my personality, to attract attention and converts. || A Jew never laughs without looking at his wife for approval. || You know how many stunning women told me they can't stand a good-looking man? Women feel secure with an ugly guy because a man in bad shape isn't gonna cheat. || Politics doesn't make strange bedfellows, marriage does. || By these things examine thyself. By whose rules am I acting; in whose name; in whose strength; in whose glory? What faith, humility, self-denial, and love of God and to man have there been in all my actions? || Jews are the best dressers in the world. They buy the best clothes, the best homes, the best cars. The best of everything. The only thing is, they get it for less. || Predictions are preposterous. || My comedy doesn't come from any calculations and studies. || I have nothing but love in my heart and everything I say is just an instrument for laughs. || I can't pretend that I'm a great student of the art of comedy because anybody that becomes philosophical about humour doesn't know what he's talking about. || Did you ever hear of a kid playing accountant - even if they wanted to be one? || I don't believe that anybody has come to a conclusion on why something is funny. It's funny because it's ridiculous and it's ridiculous for different reasons at different times. || It is easy to tell the difference between Jews and Gentiles. After the show, all the gentiles are saying 'Have a drink? Want a drink? Let's have a drink!' While all the Jews are saying 'Have you eaten yet? Want a piece of cake? Let's have some cake!' || I was so self-conscious, every time football players went into a huddle, I thought they were talking about me. || If an Englishman gets run down by a truck he apologizes to the truck. || Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe. || I've never heard of an Israeli going out as a suicide bombers to kill Palestinians. I never saw anybody offer more peace to the Palestinians. Palestinians, many of them that are our enemies, we still invite them to live in our own country, endangering our own lives to give them equal pay on equal jobs and health care benefits and all kinds of benefits. When an Arab is hurt, even trying to kill us, we give them the best hospitals, the best medical care. We make them partners in our own Parliament, and we're persecuting them? This is such a sick perversion. It's like saying the Jews persecuted Hitler. || Money is not the most important thing in the world. Love is. Fortunately, I love money. || It's no longer a question of staying healthy. It's a question of finding a sickness you like. || Prostitutes go to jail. Their customers go home and read the New York Times. In this country you're allowed to buy anything. If you need a shirt, you have a right to buy it. If you need sex, you don't. What's more important, sex or a shirt? || Did you know that the Jews invented sushi? That's right - two Jews bought a restaurant with no kitchen. || While I have the utmost respect for people who practice the Christian faith, the fact is, as everyone knows, I am as Jewish as a matzo ball or kosher salami. || Heard on the radio this morning about a guy who walked into a bank and presented a teller with a note that read ""I have a gun. Give me all your money. Bang."" The teller gave him the money and he walked out of the bank. He was caught only a short while later. Why? He had written the note on the back of his parole card. || My grandfather always said, ""Don't watch your money, watch your health."" So one day while I was watching my health, someone stole my money. It was my grandfather. || Here's another one about an unlucky purse snatcher. In the middle of last year, I heard a story about a purse snatcher (in England, I believe) who snatched a woman's purse. Much to his surprise and dismay, he found an arm attached to it after he'd grabbed it. It seems that the woman had a prosthetic arm, and he picked the right (or wrong) arm. Apparently, the guy babbled for quite a while, and the woman called the police, and they picked him up, still babbling. || England is the only country in the world where the food is more dangerous than the sex. || It is more profitable for your congressman to support the tobacco industry than your life. || The fellow robbed something like a supermarket of about $5000 (value approximate and probably wrong, since it is from fuzzy memory). The local newspaper ran the story, but with the amount given as $7000. The thief called the newspaper to complain about the inaccuracy and to suggest that maybe the store manager ripped off the extra $2000 and was unjustly blaming the thief. The people at the newspaper kept him busy on the phone giving his version of the story while the police traced the call to a phone booth and arrived to arrest him while he was still talking to the newspaper! || I'm crazy about the fact that the Jewish people should survive because they have so much to contribute and so many values to contribute to the world. It would be a much better world, a much more peaceful and non-violent world if we lived by Jewish values. || We were going to do it before the hurricane, but decided to wait. || Did you hear about the accountant who became am embezzler? He ran away with the accounts payable! || I talk to myself because I like dealing with a better class of people. || I have enough money to last me the rest of my life unless I buy something. || 'What is the meaning of life?' is a stupid question. Life just exists. You say to yourself, 'I can't accept that I mean nothing so I have to find the meaning of life so that I shouldn't mean as little as I know I do.' Subconsciously you know you're full of shit. I see life as a dance. Does a dance have to have a meaning? You're dancing because you enjoy it. || I can't predict the future and I don't have respect for people who try to. || Frankly, I'm in shock. I just can't believe it... even though I had every reason to expect it. || My material is as new as anything on the dinner table. What difference does it make if I'm 70 or if I'm 20? The audience knows they aren't getting any old stories from me. || They call it football, but the object of the game is to bash the other guy so hard that he's eventually carried off the field on a stretcher. I can't watch football anymore. My psychiatrist said it's better that way. I used to watch a game, see the players in a huddle - and think they were talking about me. || Why is it that they have Bibles in every motel room? Why should a man want to read the Bible when he's with a woman alone in a motel room? Why would he be interested? Whatever he's praying for, he's already got! || I'm still suffering from shock from the last war. I was almost drafted! Luckily I was wounded while taking the physical. When I reached the psychiatrist, I said, ""Give me a gun, I'll wipe out the whole German Army in five minutes."" He said, ""You're crazy!"" I said, ""Write it down!"" || I am excited about getting back to what I do best and what my audience likes best, I am writing new jokes every day and soon Ill be telling them every night. Just me, one Jew talking and that's it. || Victory goes to the player who makes the next-to-last mistake. || Blacks can get into medical school with a lower grade. If that's true, a Jew should be able to play basketball with a lower net. || The nervousness never lasted more than a second because he was so congenial and comfortable. He made more stars on his show, probably, than anybody in the whole history of show business. || I've been watching politics for 35 or 40 years and you just never know. You can have one person win the Iowa caucus and then the whole picture changes ten minutes later. The same thing can happen again after New Hampshire. I have no idea what's going to happen with our country in the future. || Everybody knows we're entitled to one Jerusalem. History reveals very simply that this is our land from the days of the Bible."
Janeane Garofalo,"The camera adds ten pounds. Why? What, we don't have the technology to remedy that one little thing? We can have fucking Forrest Gump cohorting with John F. Kennedy, and we can't just fix that one little thing, the ten pound variant on a lens... You can actually levitate now when you watch a movie about flying, but they just don't have the technology for that ten pound margin of error. || It is not crazy to think that powerful people do some pretty horrible things. And maybe they get out of hand. Maybe it just gets away from them. It snowballs. || Anybody who French bashes just might as well wear a badge that says 'I am a follower! I don't think for myself and I have no idea what I'm talking about.' That would be a French basher. || When I see the American flag, I go, 'Oh my God, you're insulting me.' || For my stand-up, I always have my notebook with me and if something strikes me, I'll write it down. || I think we all remember where we were when Rush Hour hit the water. That was an important day. || All roads lead to my dogs, don't they? || There's always that great photo of the actress or model lifting up her shirt just to show you the bone structure and the six-pack of her own. It's almost like when horses are auctioned and they show you their teeth. 'Am I good enough?' || Granted, not really a joke, but how often do you get a mic in your hand? You know? So. I am sorry but don't anybody trip on my soap box on the way out. Don't anybody trip over that. And the chip on my shoulder's a little heavy. I have back problems now. || No no no! Don't clap! No no no, you make me seem like I'm like a prophet or something and I'm so not! || But the only ramifications were, like, the kind of bigoted right-wing assault and pretend anger, partisan anger, that came from some right-wing radio people or the pretend anger from guys like Scarborough and nonsense like that. || The notebook. Yes, as you know Garofalo's a little forgetful. Has to bring her notebook. Between the Nutrasweet and the Fen-phen, I don't know whether to shit or wind my watch at this point. I gotta have a thing happening here because I don't wanna forget what I wanna discuss with you. I owe you that much. || When I see guys in bars wearing the real fitted kind of Calvin Klein v-neck t-shirts I just want to go up to them and be like, 'Oh, do you work out? Your tricep looks so great - thank you.' || Well, there's no credible link between Iraq and al Qaeda. There's no credible link between Iraq and 9/11. || My hell is going to be the stairmaster wing of Dante's inferno, where they're gonna tape my feet to the pedals and the only music I get is Michael Bolton karaoke style. || Historically the mainstream media has never been particularly friendly to any socially progressive ideas. || God just seems very man-made to me. There are so many theories, and not everyone can be right. It's human nature to need a religious crutch, and I don't begrudge anyone that. I just don't need one. || This dress exacerbates the genetic betrayal that is my legacy. || I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things. The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And I just cut my lip on it. And chipped a tooth. || I don't have a good work ethic. I have a real casual relationship with hours. || I think that by staying out of shape at the age of 33 I'm doing myself a huge favor for my future. There will never be anyone commenting on how I've 'let myself go.' I've gone. It's gone. It's not going, it's gone. || I would say that, unfortunately, the word liberal has been redefined over the last 30 years as if it is a bad thing. But liberalism is a great American philosophy. Being a liberal is one of the best things you can be. I don’t think they get a fair shake at all in the conservative mainstream media. So maybe there’s some intimidation there. || I don't know that I would need to be famous as a Middle East policy expert to see that unilateral imperialism is bad policy. || He said that faith is like a glass of water. When you're young, the glass is small, and it's easy to fill up. But the older you get, the bigger the glass gets, and the same amount of liquid doesn't fill it anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be refilled. || If you don't do any self-examinations or see a doctor ever, you'll live forever. That's how you do it. The diagnosis is what gets you. You just have a don't ask, don't tell policy with any and all bodily functions. || Until as women we all say, ""No! We are not going to starve ourselves"", nothing is going to change. We're our own worse enemies sometimes but I still blame men. || I'm almost 46. You become no longer even regarded in a sexual way. As you get older you're just taken out of that realm. So it's not anything that particularly confronts me very much at all. || Sometimes the critics review me harshly for not being critical of government but it's not me who has said I was political. || For some reason I get advertised when I travel as a political comedian, which I'm not. Sometimes I talk about it and sometimes I don't. || The reason a person is a republican is because something is wrong with them. Again, that's science - that's neuroscience. You cannot be well adjusted, open-minded, pluralistic, enlightened and be a republican. || You young people with your twittering and your creating of content. Or what is it - queefing? I don't know what you young people are calling it.  || A lot of the hate mail I get is clearly misogynist. I am a proud liberal, feminist woman, and the hate mail I get about those three things is not about me. It's about those signifers, and about what the right in this country has managed to do to perpetuate anger over what they mean. || Without liberals we wouldn't have unions. We wouldn't have environmental protections. We wouldn't have seat belts or birth control or the ACLU! Any of these things! || What has Iraq done to us? || Well I don't know what the city of Hollywood knows about foreign policy, but do I know that a lot of people do learn and educate themselves about policy and I don't have to be a policy expert to know that this will be a disaster. || You just did a whole read-through. The lie that brought us into war was that Iraq was a threat to us. Well, now it is a threat. Now it is a terrorist hotbed. The fiction is now reality. And now we have to deal with it. It was an attempt at a corporate takeover. This was about oil. It wasn't about human rights. It's not about human rights. || There's nothing wrong with the word conspiracy. It just means 'to breathe together'. || To a right-winger, unions are awful. Why do right-wingers hate unions? Because collective bargaining is the power that a worker has against the corporation. Right-wingers hate that. || Nationalism and patriotism in the wrong hands will destroy lives, it really will, because I'll tell you something: it takes a village to ruin a child. I think we've proven that time and time again in this country. || You know what is good about these Dixie Chicks burnings or bashings? It's a wonderful, wonderful way for really stupid people to hook up. They meet, they throw some things on the fire, they talk about Vin Diesel, they tell stories about who their favorite Fox anchor is, they exchange phone numbers and in some cases has led to marriages. || I'm not religious anymore, but I think it's like papal infallibility, which is a ridiculous man-made tenet, like what I believe most religious tenets to be, are man-made after the fact. || Have you ever noticed nobody has ever ordered a grapefruit the size of a tumor? Ever. There's no reciprocity. || The term 'celebrity' makes my skin crawl. || I absolutely realize that a celebrity spokesperson is not ideal. || You know George W. Bush is a war-time president, he says – proudly. Guess what. War is failure! When you are at war, you have failed! When you have gone to a war of choice and lied about it, you're a double-triple, triple-quadruple failure! Or a warlord. It's called a warlord in other countries. A war time president here. One man's ceiling I guess is another man's floor. George Bush is a warlord. He's a failure! || It sounds like I'm always being facetious. That's why I never get voice over work. 'You sound like you hate the product.' || But let me ask you this though, first and foremost: who's your favorite Spice Girl? Mine is Sporty Spice and I'll tell you why. You know what? She might not be as aesthetically pleasant as the rest but she'll do a backflip and steal your heart. || I can't wait for the next fad though, and I predict it's going to be Pennsylvania dutch culture, very Amish. It's going to be bonnets and butter churns. || We're (women) our own worst enemies a lot of the time, but I still blame men. || You have to have a lot more dedication to what I'll call 'the machine,' ... I have 20 percent dedication. What's needed is 110 percent. You can't have it with the level of apathy I have. || I don't think Hollywood was trying to do anything with me. In fact, they lost interest pretty quick. I think I got lucky, briefly, in the '90s, and it just so happened that those movies were the opportunities that came my way. Then it just kind of stopped. || A war is going to destroy our economy even further. It's going to be a threefold humanitarian disaster. || Pedestrian's rights - because we live in California, I've got to address this issue. I don't know where on the fence I am about that. I suppose if I'm walking, I'm all for it, but if I'm driving, that's a whole other can of worms. || Is being an idiot like being high all the time? || It's mentally exhausting, feeling bad about something you can do nothing about. || I was a 36C or D, and at 5' 1'', I knew that being a small person with big boobs standing in front of an audience was not going to be easy. It would be really hard to get people to pay attention to me without mocking me. Getting a breast reduction to prepare for my career was no different from people who work to get good grades to get into a good college to get into a good graduate school to get a good job. I went down to a B cup, and it was the best thing in the whole world. || Taking into account the public's regrettable lack of taste, it is incumbent upon you not to fit in. || Tina Fey is part of a generation of women who have changed the face of comedy at 'Second City,' 'SNL,' in sitcoms and in film. || Our country is founded on a sham: our forefathers were slave-owning rich white guys who wanted it their way. So when I see the American flag, I go, ""Oh my God, you're insulting me."" That you can have a gay parade on Christopher Street in New York, with naked men and women on a float cheering, 'We're here, we're queer!"" - that's what makes my heart swell. Not the flag, but a gay naked man or woman burning the flag. I get choked up with pride. || I got mugged. And they got my knapsack with my comedy notebook in it. So if anybody see two cholos bombing at the Funny Bone chain, that would be them. Just give me a jingle. || The Bible, I've said it before, is a beautifully written work of fiction. || Last night, I went to a birthday party, and this girl brought a cake and a cheesecake. And the other girls that lived in the apartment, I swear to God, all night long: 'You're taking that cake with you when you go. That cake's not staying in this house.' Like it's this evil, Hope Diamond, nuclear, horrifying cursed thing. || Listening to your tape, I was reminded of this poem. It has the central question: Is it harder to count on someone or to know that you're being the one counted upon? Anyway, there's this part that goes: if equal affection cannot be, then let the more loving one be me. Have you ever read that one? It's one of my favorites. || Rejection kills, disappointment only maims. || When Communist U.S.S.R. was a superpower, the world was better off. The right-wing media is trying to marginalize the peace movement. || I think I failed miserably on NewsRadio. I was very nervous because of the caliber of the cast - especially Dave Foley - so I think I did a terrible job. || Not that I was ever an asshole but I used to be much more of a bulldozer. || They have these runway shows and then they have a commentator going, ""A return to glamor this season. A pretty face is your best asset this season."" As opposed to last season. When ugly girls had a free ride. When back fat was all the rage. || There's been times when I have actually had sex indoors. And then you kind of sober up a little when it's over. I become like a bartender at 2 AM. ""OK, people, let's move it out! Yeah, you don't have to go home but you can’t stay here."" || Red flag of the eating disorder: the muffin. Keep your eye on the ladies with the muffins... and sometimes I'll just eat the muffin top. || Let's be very honest about what this is about. It's not about bashing Democrats, it's not about taxes, they have no idea what the Boston tea party was about, they don't know their history at all. This is about hating a black man in the White House. This is racism straight up. || Many people feel that mass acceptance and smooth socialization are desirable life paths for a young adult... Many people are often wrong... Don't bother being nice. Being popular and well liked is not in your best interest. Let me be more clear; if you behave in a manner pleasing to most, then you are probably doing something wrong. The masses have never been arbiters of the sublime, and they often fail to recognize the truly great individual. Taking into account the public's regrettable lack of taste, it is incumbent upon you not to fit in. || Conservative talk radio hosts have conned the American people into thinking there is such a thing as a pro-life, pro-war, pro-gun, pro-death penalty Christian. || Also, as I've gotten older and more mature, I've become much more comfortable in my own skin. After 25 years of doing stand-up, that's reflected onstage. || It's been hard in entertainment as a 45-year-old woman to find jobs. They get fewer and far between if you're older, unless you're one of the few lucky ones who work constantly, like Meryl Streep. || To combat social awkwardness, I would just act like I couldn't be bothered - that kind of aloof persona or aloof demeanor. It's so off-putting. || To me, there is no greater act of courage than being the one who kisses first. || You just need an opportunity and then you yourself have to do a good job, and then you hope that people go, 'Oh yeah, I forgot about her.' || You know, I've had Botox. The woman who does it is very good, obviously. Very conservative. || The world would be better off with multiple superpowers. When Communist USSR was a superpower, the world was better off. || Your average person wouldn't recognize a sublime entity if it attempted to fist fuck them while waiting in line for the next Batman sequel. || Iraq is a manufactured conflict for the sake of geopolitical dominance in the area. || People think that you are a nasty, selfish person if you don't want to have children. || Leaving your ears open to the suggestions of others only closes the mind's eye, thereby creating a type of spiritual glaucoma. || I'm sorry for being me. I won't ever do it again. || To love is to risk not to be loved in return. || How is it that this debate has been twisted on its head, that somehow those that advocate peace and diplomacy are anti-American? Or those that advocate peace are anti-troops or pro-Saddam? || I don't think that the administration is being particularly honest with the American people about what this is going to cost in life and in dollars, what the dangers are, retaliatory strikes, once it happens. This is not a war that needs to happen immediately, if ever. || Should have dogs before they have kids. Everybody. || I feel like the American people are being lied to and manipulated. President Bush is trying to force 9/11 and Saddam together. || There is no way any rational, reasonable person can say that the Bush Administration has been good for America. || I'm not a disciplined writer. || You know, there's nothing more interesting than seeing a bunch of racists become confused and angry at a speech they're not quite certain what he's saying. || I'm a walker. I enjoy walking, which I think psychologically expresses my feelings of wanting liberation without exerting myself too much. || This world is bullshit. And just because I appear in music video wherein I am in my underwear, and make young women feel not good enough so that they become anorxeic; and okay, maybe because of that I became popular more quickly than other singers who are, I don't know, maybe more talented or better songwriters. That doesn't matter because, and... um... my boyfriend is a magician, and he can pull a quarter out of your ear and say things like 'We have not met before have we?' Go with yourself. || Sex is the quickest way to ruin a friendship. || I would have to say loneliness is next to uncleanliness. || I'm grateful for any opportunity to act. || Here's what the right-wing has in, there's no shortage of the natural resources of ignorance, apathy, hate, fear. As long as those things are in the collective conscious and unconscious, the Republicans will have some votes. || I actually was class clown, but I don't know how that happened because I've never been considered an outwardly funny person - as the people in this room will attest. || I can do most anything and not have a problem with it. The only time I have negative attention is when I run naked through the streets brandishing a handgun. || I do not enjoy when people don't like me. || I mostly get takeout, I have to admit - I don't know if that's something to be ashamed of. I'm not much of a cook. || Listen, young people, I understand narcissism - clearly. But at least I have the decency to hate myself. And that's what's missing from the young people. They don't have the debilitating self-loathing and the second guessing.  || I don't understand why, in entertainment, the hours are as long as they are. It seems like everything takes forever, and no one can tell you why exactly. || Dog Park was a blast. I love Bruce McCulloch. That was a case of the studio taking the cut away from the director, and it went from being a great movie to a shitty movie. Bruce's original cut that I saw was hilarious. || I say at this point, for different reasons, Bush and Hussein are both very threatening to world peace and to deny that is to be incredibly naive. || I would say just in general, in life, I'm more willing to be animated as a person, and so obviously onstage as well. || I would prefer to be well-liked in any and all situations. || Men are allowed to age. Men are allowed to gain weight. Men are allowed to be quirky looking."
Jay Leno,"People don't mind if you have a lot of money if they know you're working for it. || The best way to ruin a comedy is to throw a lot of money at it. || According to the L.A. Times, Attorney General John Ashcroft wants to take ""a harder stance"" on the death penalty. What's a harder stance on the death penalty? We're already killing the guy? How do you take a harder stance on the death penalty? What, are you going to tickle him first? Give him itching powder? Put a thumbtack on the electric chair? || How would it be if we discovered that aliens only stopped by earth to let their kids take a leak? || The Bush administration said today there is a lot of support for us to attack Iraq. Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Chevron, they're all lining up. || Today is Valentine's Day - or, as men like to call it, Extortion Day! || ""I am not just another notch on your belt?"" she asked him. ""Of course not."" he said as he put a mark on the chalkboard. || They were going crazy in Kansas. People were up to 9 p.m. I think that was the greatest thing to happen to Kansas since the eradication of the boll weevil. || The Environmental Protection Agency is conducting a seven-hundred-thousand-dollar study to see if Alaskan trees are polluting Oregon forests. You can tell Republicans are in power. ""Pollution? It's those damn trees."" || Bob Dole revealed he is one of the test subjects for Viagra. He said on Larry King, 'I wish I had bought stock in it.' Only a Republican would think the best part of Viagra is the fact that you could make money off of it. || Now, today is the day we honor, of course, the Presidents, ranging from George Washington, who couldn't tell a lie, to George Bush, who couldn't tell the truth, to Bill Clinton, who couldn't tell the difference. || You can't stay mad at somebody who makes you laugh. || Magic Johnson, former basketball player, may run for mayor of L.A. in the next election. Remember the good 'ol days when only qualified people ran for office like actors and professional wrestlers. || A survey asked married women when they most want to have sex. 84 per cent of them said right after their husband is finished. || If I have one advantage, it's that I will try to work harder than the next guy. || I was in the ROTC. Of course, ROTC stood for 'Running off to Canada.' || A new poll shows only 3 percent strongly approve of the job Congress is doing, with a margin of error of 4 percent, so it’s possible that ""less than no one"" thinks they’re doing a good job. || The Flinstones wore furs, they ate red meat, and had a stoneage philosophy. In fact, they were the first Republicans... || Ambition beats genius 99 percent of the time. || The Yugo has come out with a very clever antitheft device. They made their name bigger. || The Supreme Court has ruled that they cannot have a nativity scene in Washington, D.C. This wasn't for any religious reasons. They couldn't find three wise men and a virgin. || Bush reiterated his stand to conservatives opposing his decision on stem cell research. He said today he believes life begins at conception and ends at execution. || The reason there are two senators for each state is so that one can be the designated driver. || CNN found that Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in America. Women admire her because she's strong and successful. Men admire her because she allows her husband to cheat and get away with it. || For the first time in history, sex is more dangerous than the cigarette afterward. || With hurricanes, tornadoes, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding, severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to another, and with the threat of bird flu and terrorist attacks, ""Are we sure this is a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?"" || In America, we like everyone to know about the good work we're doing anonymously. || Researchers found a frog in new guinea that is so tiny, they believe it's the smallest vertebrate on the planet. It has the tiniest backbone of any living creature, except members of Congress. || It's not called cocaine any more. It's now referred to as ""Crack Classic."" || Nissan is designing a car that will read the driver’s mind. I already know what I’m going to do. I want a car that will read the other guy’s mind. || I didn't realize it was October until I saw the Chicago Cubs choking. || If God had wanted us to vote, he would have given us candidates. || If you don't want your dog to have bad breath, do what I do: Pour a little Lavoris in the toilet. || My stockbroker asked me something important today: paper or plastic? || Nineteen percent of doctors say that they'd be able to give their patients a lethal injection. But they also went on to say that the patient would have to be really, really behind on payments. || The Pentagon still has not given a name to the Iraqi war. Somehow 'Operation Re-elect Bush' doesn't seem to be popular. || Go through your phone book, call people and ask them to drive you to the airport. The ones who will drive you are your true friends. The rest aren't bad people; they're just acquaintances. || There's this big pie in show business, and you physically can't eat the whole pie. If you give everybody a slice of pie, you will still have more than enough. The real trick is not to try to get the whole pie, but to keep the biggest slice. || A new study found that people who are depressed have a greater risk of stroke. Well that should cheer them up. || According to New York publishers, Bill Clinton will get more money for his book than Hillary Clinton got for hers. Well, duh. At least his book has some sex in it. || The 99 Cent Only Store is calling itself your Valentine's Day headquarters. Guys, if that's your Valentine's Day headquarters, you can also call the garage your new home. || The first case of mad cow disease since 2006 was discovered right here in the United States. The good news, since the cow is in California, instead of putting the cow down, they are going to enroll him in anger management classes. || The Kinsey Institute says gay men have bigger sex organs. Hence the origin of gay pride. || I feel bad for people who die on Valentine's Day. How much would flowers cost then, ten grand? || Men are liars. We lie about lying if we have to. || Al Gore has found a new job. He is going to teach journalism at Columbia University, which is ironic isn't it? The guy who did all the coke winds up going to the White House, the guy who didn't do coke goes to Columbia. || Good news. President Bush is creating thousands of new jobs. Unfortunately, all of them are at the White House. || President Bush played golf yesterday and I understand Vice President Dick Cheney also got in a couple of strokes. || President Bush said this Iraq situation looks like 'the rerun of a bad movie.' Well sure, there's a Bush in the White House, the economy's going to hell, we're going to war over oil. I've seen this movie, haven't I?. || Bush is smart. I don't think that Bush will ever be impeached, 'cause unlike Clinton, Reagan, or even his father, George W. is immune from scandal. Because, if George W. testifies that he had no idea what was going on, wouldn't you believe him? || The New York Police Department says Iran has conducted surveillance inside New York City. They say Iranian operatives are using special mobile surveillance units. I believe they're called taxi cabs. || Twenty-one years ago today Saddam Hussein was first elected president of Iraq and he has been re-elected ever since. Apparently they have the same electoral process we do, you don't need the popular vote to win. || Do you know what White House correspondents call actors who pose as reporters? Anchors. || 9% would give up sex for the remote control. 91% has already given up sex for the remote control! || According to the Mayans, the world is supposed to end in the year 2012. Are you buying that? When's the last time you even ran into a Mayan? || There are now more obese people in the United States than there are overweight people.

The thief is considered armed and fabulous. || British scientists say they have developed a super broccoli that can help fight heart disease. You know, if you want to fight heart disease, why don't you come up with a food people will actually eat? Like a super glazed doughnut. || China is now expected to surpass Japan as the 2nd richest country in the world. They could become the richest, but that’s only if we pay them the money we owe them, and that’s not going to happen. || The Mars rover Curiosity has sent back images of some odd things on the surface of Mars, and some people think they could be UFOs. Here's my question. If we're on the surface of Mars, aren't we the UFO? || For the first time ever, women are scoring higher than men on IQ tests. Scientists say it has something to do with breast implants - not that it makes the women smarter, it just makes the men dumber. || According to geologists, about 100 million years from now, Asia and the Americas will smash together to form one giant supercontinent. The good news: Maybe all those jobs that went over there will finally come back. || If we go down in flames, we will be laughing on the way down, believe me. || Valentines day are coming up and a German company has made chokolate in shapes of couples making love. I don't like them... I don't want my chokolate to have more fun than me. || Isn't it a little ironic here? We pick politicians by how they look on TV and Miss America on where she stands on the issues.

Hey, how about an investigation into whether it's appropriate to have a civilian with no experience running the country? || President Bush announced tonight that he believes in democracy and that democracy can exist in Iraq. They can have a strong economy, they can have a good health care plan, and they can have a free and fair voting. Iraq? We can't even get this in Florida. || President Bush said for security reasons, he's sworn off all e-mail communication. He will not be using email at the White House at all. Is that a good idea? I mean, it's not like that speaking thing was working out so good. || Soup is just a way of screwing you out of a meal. || I think high self-esteem is overrated.

Eat a little more chocolate."" || McDonalds announced it’s considering a more humane way of slaughtering its animals. You know they fatten them up and then kill them. You know the same thing they do to their customers, isn’t it? || I have the same friends I had in high school. I'm married to the same woman I had. I'm still driving the same car I had when I dated her, although I got a few more. I come in here and I enjoy it. I enjoy being a voyeur to show business. I enjoy looking at it and being around it. But it doesn't become my life. I don't let it absorb me. || They always say the Miss America Pageant isn't a beauty contest, it's really a scholarship program.

Fall in love with the back of your cereal box. || It's like my brain and my penis are locked in a chess match, and I'm letting him win. || Life is truly a ride. We're all strapped in and no one can stop it. When the doctor slaps your behind, he's ripping your ticket and away you go. As you make each passage from youth to adulthood to maturity, sometimes you put your arms up and scream, sometimes you just hang on to that bar in front of you. But the ride is the thing. I think the most you can hope for at the end of life is that your hair's messed, you're out of breath, and you didn't throw up. || To me, if life boils down to one thing, it's movement. To live is to keep moving. || That's the true spirit of Christmas; people being helped by people other than me. || I'll tell you one thing, since I'm married, single people look absolutely ridiculous to me. || When someone does a small task beautifully, their whole environment is affected by it. || Marriage is like a game of chess except the board is flowing water, the pieces are made of smoke and no move you make will have any effect on the outcome. || Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean, only a sick, twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant. || Men want to make women happy. || Festivus for the Restivus! || When you interrupt, you've stopped listening. People need to be heard. || And that's when I realized, when you're a kid you don't need a costume, you are superman. || You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweatpants? You're telling the world, 'I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable.' || According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy. || I wonder if illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup? || You know, crankiness is at the essence of all comedy. || Well, Howard Stern has been doing his impression of me for years. It doesn't really bother me. || I'll tell you what I like about Chinese people. They're hanging in there with the chopsticks, aren't they? You know they've seen the fork. They're staying with the sticks. I don't know how they missed it. Chinese farmer gets up, works in the field with a shovel all day. Shovel. Spoon. Come on. You're not plowing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues!  || We sold 'Seinfeld' all over the world but it was a very specific kind of show. In some countries it went down really well, in others they hated it. || The greatest thing about being a comedian is knowing other comedians. And you get to talk to them. Its the most fun. || You know what I never get with the limo? The tinted windows. Is that so people don't see you? Yeah, what a better way not to have people notice you than taking a thirty foot Cadillac with a TV antenna and a uniformed driver. How discreet. Nobody cares who's in the limo. You see a limo go by, you know it's either some rich jerk or fifty prom kids with $1.75 each. || Can't you at least die with a little dignity? || Stand-up is hard. || Men like a ref decision because they just want to get back to the game. || If you go to a bad movie, it's two hours. If you're in a bad movie, it's two years. || I like definitive things. || You'll fold faster than Superman on laundry day. || The truth is, I had always wanted to be a comedian, but I really didn't have that kind of personality, and it's a terrifying thing to say. || Dogs have no money. Isn't that amazing? They're broke their entire lives. But they get through. You know why dogs have no money? No pockets. || You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately, my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning. Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the city. || My wife is funny. And I dabble in it. So being funny is big around our house. But what's surprised me is my daughter can do an English accent. I don't know how she learned this. || I love being a dad. I just love it. || I can walk through a hotel lobby and watch people at the desk and see what they're doing. People don't look at me. They don't even know I'm there. || I won't do something unless I can get at least two or three good laughs out of it. If I can't, it's not gonna make the team. || I wrote an article on a new Porsche for 'Automobile Magazine.' I knew the editor, and she asked me to write this article. So I'm more proud of that than anything. || You can be passionate about anything. || Dogs are the leaders of the planet. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume is in charge. || What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it? || Economy is essential to all good art. || The best revenge is living well. || I was in front of an ambulance the other day, and I noticed that the word ""ambulance"" was spelled in reverse print on the hood of the ambulance. And I thought, ""Well, isn't that clever."" I look in the rear-view mirror; I can read the word ""ambulance"" behind me. Of course while you're reading, you don't see where you're going, you crash. You need an ambulance. I think they're trying to drum up some business on the way back from lunch. || People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public. || ""Wait up!"" That's what kids say. They don't say ""wait"", they say ""Wait up! Hey, wait up!"" 'Cause when you're little, your life is up. The future is up. Everything you want is up. ""Wait up! Hold up! Shut up! Mom, I'll clean up! Let me stay up!"" Parents of course are just the opposite. Everything is down. ""Just calm down. Slow down. Come down here. Sit down. Put that down."" || There is no more embarrassing thing in my life that the fact that I have actually uttered the phrase, ""I would like to order the Ginsu Knife."" || See, the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around but they don't know they're ugly because nobody actually tells them. || Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we areto the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing. || Where lipstick is concerned, the important thing is not color, but to accept God's final word on where your lips end. || There's no downside to fame and people who whine about it make me sick. It's the greatest thing in the world. || I am so busy doing nothing... that the idea of doing anything - which as you know, always leads to something - cuts into the nothing and then forces me to have to drop everything. || I have a friend who's collecting unemployment insurance. This guy has never worked so hard in his life as he has to keep this thing going. He's down there every week, waiting on the lines and getting interviewed and making up all these lies about looking for jobs. If they had any idea of the effort and energy that he is expending to avoid work, I'm sure they'd give him a raise. || The luge is the only Olympic event where you could have people competing in it against their will, and it would look exactly the same. Take people off the street, ""Hey, hey, hey, what is this?! I don't wanna be in the luge!"" Once you put that helmet on them, ""You're in the luge, buddy!"" ""aaaAAAaaaAAAaaaAAA...aaaAAAAA..."" World record. Didn't even wanna do it. I'd like to see that next Olympics, the Involuntary Luge. || The Olympics is really my favorite sporting event. Although, I think I have a problem with that silver medal. Because when you think about it, you win the gold - you feel good, you win the bronze - you think, ""Well, at least I got something"". But when you win that silver it's like, ""Congratulations, you almost won. Of all the losers you came in first of that group. You're the number one loser. No one lost ahead of you!""  || I will never understand why they cook on TV. I can't smell it. Can't eat it. Can't taste it. The end of the show they hold it up to the camera, ""Well, here it is. You can't have any. Thanks for watching. Goodbye."" || I had a parakeet that used to fly around the house and crash into these huge mirrors my mother put in. Ever heard of this interior design principle, that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, ""Hey look, there's a whole other room in there. There's a guy that looks just like me in there."" || I like staying in hotels. I like their tiny soap. I like to pretend it's regular-sized and my muscles are huge. || A dog will stay stupid. That's why we love them so much. The entire time we know them, they're idiots. Think of your dog. Every time you come home, he thinks it's amazing. He has no idea how you accomplish this every day. You walk in the door; the joy of this experience overwhelms him. He looks at you, ""He's back. It's that guy, that same guy."" He can't believe it. Everything is amazing to your dog. ""Another can of food? I don't believe it."" || Cremation has become the most popular form of burial in the United States... People used to want a big, thick granite stone, their names carved into with a chisel. ""I was here dammit!"" Cremation is like you're trying to cover up a crime. ""Burn the body. Scatter the ashes around. As far as anyone’s concerned this whole thing never happened."" || A chef who doesn't wash his hands is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help. || The basic conflict between men and women, sexually, is that men are like firemen. To men, sex is an emergency, and no matter what we’re doing we can be ready in two minutes. Women, on the other hand, are like fire. They’re very exciting, but the conditions have to be exactly right for it to occur. || There's very little advice in men's magazines, because men don't think there's a lot they don't know. Women do. Women want to learn. Men think, ""I know what I'm doing, just show me somebody naked."" || I don't wanna be a Pirate! || Why do people give each other flowers? To celebrate various important occasions, they're killing living creatures? Why restrict it to plants? 'Sweetheart, let's make up. Have this deceased squirrel.' || Somebody just gave me a shower radio. Thanks a lot. Do you really want music in the shower? I guess there's no better place to dance than a slick surface next to a glass door. || Being a good husband is like being a good stand-up comic - you need ten years before you can even call yourself a beginner. || The IRS! They're like the Mafia, they can take anything they want! || I was the best man to a wedding one time, that was pretty good. Pretty good title, I thought, best man. I thought it was a bit much. I thought we'd have the groom and a pretty good man. That's more than enough. If I'm the best man, why is she marrying him? || The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all the same; so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is like the joining together of a beautiful, glowing bride and some guy. The tuxedo is a wedding safety device, created by women because they know that men are undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes one step over, and she marries the next guy. || The first real thought that I had of something that I might do was to write for car magazines, because I always had a car thing. || Make no mistake about why these babies are here - they are here to replace us. || There is no such thing as fun for the whole family. || When I jumped off a roof in Cannes in a bee costume, I looked ridiculous. But this is my business; I have to humiliate myself. || What I don't understand is how women can pour hot wax on their bodies, let it dry, then rip out every single hair by its root and still be scared of spiders. || If I want a long boring story with no point to it, I have my life. || You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better. || I'm really enjoying this. Could this be a weekly series? || You know you're getting old when you get that one candle on the cake. It's like, 'See if you can blow this out.' || A bookstore is one of the only pieces of evidence we have that people are still thinking. || I just knew it was time to leave that thing where it was. Even though I still occasionally think about it, I still think I did it the right way. It was the correct type of ending. By which I mean it came a little sooner than people were expecting...was such a wonderful experience for me. It wasn't even the thing I thought I was going to have a talent for. I just fell in with the perfect group of people and everything about it was sort of miraculous. || Are there keys to a plane? Maybe that's what those delays are sometimes, when you're just sitting there at the gate. Maybe the pilot sits up there in the cockpit going, ""Oh, I don't believe this. Dammit... I did it again."" They tell you it's something mechanical because they don't want to come on the P. A. system, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a while. I uh... Oh, God this is so embarrassing... I, I left the keys to the plane in my apartment. They're in this big ashtray by the front door. I'm sorry, I'll run back and get them."" || The truth is, the family is much more creatively nourishing because you're playing on a full keyboard. Whereas when you're single, you're just playing the upbeat jazzy tunes. || I once had a leather jacket that got ruined in the rain. Why does moisture ruin leather? Aren't cows outside a lot of the time? When it's raining, do cows go up to the farmhouse, ""Let us in! We're all wearing leather! Open the door! We're going to ruin the whole outfit here!"" || Just what is the handicapped parking situation at the Special Olympics? Is it still just the two spaces? || You have to motivate yourself with challenges. That's how you know you're still alive. || The Beatles created something that never trailed off. What a gift that was to their fans. If you're into the Beatles, you loved them from beginning to end. || The big advantage of a book is it's very easy to rewind. Close it and you're right back at the beginning. || What would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking, all the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date last? About 13 seconds, I think. ""Oh, sorry, your rear end is too big."" ""That's ok, your breath stinks anyway. See you later."" || But after they settle in you've still got to be funny, because for an hour just the fact they get to see you live in a theater is going to wear off if you're not doing well. || Women have two orgasms, the real ones and the ones they make up on their own. And I can give you the male point of view on this, which is: we're fine with it. You do whatever you have to do, and we'll do whatever we have to. ...To a man, sex is like a car accident anyway, and trying to determine a female orgasm is like asking, ""What did you see after the car went out of control?"" ""Well, there were a lot of screeching noises, I was facing the wrong way at one point, and in the end, my body was thrown clear."" || To me, a lawyer is basically the person that knows the rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our pieces around the board, but if there is a problem the lawyer is the only person who has read the inside of the top of the box. || Why is McDonalds still counting? How insecure is this company? 40 million, 80 billion million jillion killion tillion... who cares? Is anyone really impressed by that any more? ""Ooh, 89 billion sold? All right, I'll have one! I'm satisfied!"" I'd like to tell the CEO of McDonalds, ""Look. We all get it, okay? You've sold a lot of hamburgers. Whatever the number is, just put up a sign, 'McDonalds: We're Doing Very Well.' We are tired of hearing about every goddamn one of them."" || My parents didn't want to move to Florida, but they turned sixty and that's the law. || Why do they call it a ""building""? It looks like they're finished. Why isn't it a ""built""? || Pain is usually represented by lightning attacking the guy. Glowing redness is also popular. Sometimes parts of the guy would just burst into flames. || Well, all comedy starts with anger. You get angry, and its never for a good reason, right? You know its not a good reason. And then you try and work it from there. || The padded outfits, the bad scripts, the phony-looking sets... he dealt with it all. He had to. He was Superman. || I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others. I can't be with someone like that. || Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep-fried in chocolate sauce! || Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains, a pretty violent image there. I think if you've got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem. Maybe you should get rid of the body before you do the wash. || If a book about failures doesn't sell, is it a success? || Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason. || Sex to save the friendship? Well if we have to we have to. || You can measure distance by time. ""How far away is it?"" ""Oh about 20 minutes."" But it doesn't work the other way. ""When do you get off work?"" ""Around 3 miles."" || Men want the same thing from their underwear that they want from women: a little bit of support, and a little bit of freedom. || Men don't care what's on TV. They only care what else is on TV. || I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider other people's feelings. || People who read the tabloids deserve to be lied to. || A two-year-old is kind of like having a blender, but you don't have a top for it. || Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid. || See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them. || When you've been in the business 5-years, as a person, it's like you're 5-years old - like a child. 10-years and you're 10-years old, 20... Etcetera. That's how I measure maturity in this industry. || I went up to the camp and Paul had me eat my first oyster I had never had an oyster in my life. And he convinced me to eat one. And it was horrible and it was exciting. And I thought, this will be gross and I'll have a story: I had my first oyster with Paul Newman. || Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun. You don't stare at it. It's too risky. Ya get a sense of it and then you look away. || The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. Pretty impressive. Also pretty lucky for them. Ever seen that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with? Not much of a weapon there. Corkscrews. Bottle openers. 'Come on, buddy, let’s go. You get past me, the guy in the back of me, he’s got a spoon. Back off, I’ve got the toe clippers right here.' || Taking in a baseball game on TV is also a big treat. || Once you start doing only what you've already proven you can do, you're on the road to death. || I prefer the old theaters because the audience is... trapped. || I think it's funny to be delicate with subjects that are explosive. || The Four Levels of Comedy: Make your friends laugh, Make strangers laugh, Get paid to make strangers laugh, and Make people talk like you because it's so much fun. || Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it. || They have the greeting cards with the couples on the front. They photograph them. These hazy focus people. They're always having picnics. There's always a tree, a pond... Who are these people? I don't know them. I don't want them on my card either. What am I going to write inside there anyway? ""Here's another couple having a better relationship than us."" || It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. || I do not know why anyone would host an awards show. No matter how unbelievably well you do at it, the only thing that can happen is you get asked again to host an awards show. || Magazines are another medium I love, because 95% is simply based on 'How the hell are we going to fill all this blank space?' || Have you ever seen that guy who has the record for fattest man in the world? Bob Hughes, the fattest man in the world... 1400 pounds. Ladies and gentlemen, the man has let himself go. || I know there are kids out there, I want to make sure they all know that driving without braking is not something I recommend, unless you have professional clown training or a comedy background, as I do. It is not something I plan to make a habit. || Cry when you get a Golden Globe. Then you can get an Oscar nomination. || I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire. || I have a nice bookshelf in my office, but not my house. I'm crass, but not that crass. || I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me! || The worst thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you're doing. You never see anybody on TV just sliding off the front of the sofa, with potato chip crumbs all over their shirt. || I'd like to do one of those jumps they do in the movies; in a car, over a bridge, in the air with a huge explosion. It would be a final moment of entertainment."
Jim Breuer,"This town has lost a lot of business. I've had a lot of people tell me they`re tired of driving to Bonner Springs. || I never would have thought being high in a zoo would lead to that. || You can stump any stoner with one question: what were we just talking about? || The band starts playing, and everyone just starts running around and pouncing each other to show how much they like the band. What happened to clapping, man? || You tell your guy friends you got engaged, it's like hearing someone died. 'What happened man? Wow. He was so young, man. What happened? He had his whole life ahead of him. Wow, I just saw him yesterday.' || I consider myself a modern-day dad, where I still got rock'n'roll in me, but yet I take being a parent and relationships very seriously in life. I'm tired of the image of the father as a fat, beer-chugging, stupid guy. That image has to change. I'm changing it, baby, one city at a time. || Girls, do yourself a favor, don't ever bring us anywhere to pick anything out - ever, ever. You don't need us there. || I went out there, and she was playing some theater. || They suck. It's like being in love with an alcoholic. It's like, you constantly defend her, and people are like, 'Dude, your alcoholic friend is a mess,' and you're like, 'Nah, you don't know her like I do.' || Dude, I would have started throwing things at me right away. Right away. If I was nineteen years old and I was in the parking lot, or wherever I was, and I was putting whatever in my system, and I think Metallica's going on at 8 and some yo-yo goes up who's going to do comedy, I'm looking for everything I can to throw at him. || My kids started looking me up online. I'd see these routines where they weren't filthy, but I was cursing. And I realized, 'Aw, man, I can't let my kids watch this. That's stupid. Why am I cursing so much? Who am I trying to appeal to?'"
Jim Carrey,"I praticed making faces in the mirror and it would drive my mother crazy. She used to scare me by saying that I was going to see the devil if I kept looking in the mirror. That fascinated me even more, of course. || There is nothing like making love to somebody you give a shit about. || I love playing ego and insecurity combined. || Maybe other people will try to limit me but I don't limit myself. || I try to do something the audience might not have seen before. Like if I'm gonna kiss a girl I wanna kiss her like a girl has never been kissed. Like maybe I would kick her legs out from under her and catch her right before she hits the ground and then kiss her. || If I'm not back in five minutes... just wait longer! || Maybe there is no actual place called hell. Maybe hell is just having to listen to our grandparents breathe through their noses when they're eating sandwiches. || I tend to stay up late, not because I'm partying but because it's the only time of the day when I'm alone and don't have to be performing. || Well this is just a fist. But when I start throwing it around I can leave one hell of a mess. || I don't care if people think I am an overactor, as long as they enjoy what I do. People who think that would call Van Gogh an overpainter. || It's hard for anybody who's been with me not to feel starved for affection when I'm making love to my ideas. Maybe it's not meant for me to settle down and be married. || My mother was a professional sick person; she took a lot of pain pills. There are many people like that. It's just how they are used to getting attention. I always remember she's the daughter of alcoholics who'd leave her alone at Christmas time. || Desperation is a necessary ingredient to learning anything, or creating anything. Period. If you ain't desperate at some point, you ain't interesting. || Our love is like a red, red rose... and I am a little thorny. || You were never there for me were you mother? You expected Mike and Carol Brady to raise me! I'm the bastard son of Claire Huxtable! I am a Lost Cunningham! I learned the facts of life from watching The Facts of Life! Oh God! || Christmas was really where I started coming into my own as a performer because I did all this stuff on my own, all this performing on my own, When other kids were outside playing, I was in my room conjuring characters and impressions and things like that. || It is better to risk starving to death then surrender. If you give up on your dreams, what's left? || Until Ace Ventura, no actor had considered talking through his ass. || I would visualize things coming to me. It would just make me feel better. Visualization works if you work hard. That's the thing. You can't just visualize and go eat a sandwich. || I think I could go away tomorrow. I've already accomplished something. It's such a selfish business that sometimes I get sick of myself. || Hi, ladies. My name is Charlie Baileygates. Would you like to see my weasel? || Some nights it was a melee, literally, where I'd be standing trying to defend myself for what I was doing. People would be screaming at me to do my old act, and getting actually violent and angry at me. || My report card always said, ""Jim finishes first and then disrupts the other students."" || I'm so wrapped up in my work that it's often impossible to consider other things in my life. My marriage ended in divorce because of this, my relationship with Holly has suffered by this. || Uh-oh, Steven called the fuzz! ""Bad boys, bad boys... whatcha gonna do?"" || I'm very serious about no alcohol, no drugs. Life is too beautiful. || Your request is not unlike your lower intestine, stinky and loaded with danger. || I've tried everything. I've done therapy, I've done colonics. I went to a psychic who had me running around town buying pieces of ribbon to fill the colors in my aura. Did the Prozac thing. || I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started. || Just because I rock doesn't mean I'm made of stone. || I got you the big screen TV, deluxe karaoke machine, and THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants! || I love this game! || Hey ringworm. || Yeah I'm talking to you, you toxic waste of life. You gonna pick that butt up, or do I have to glue it to the end of my shoe and stick it in your big fat pimply a-hole? || If you aren't in the moment, you are either looking forward to uncertainty, or back to pain and regret. || Holy Jesus in heaven! it's a giant Q-tip. || This concludes our broadcast day. Click. || If you've got a talent, protect it. || Blast this Christmas music! It's joyful and triumphant. || Somebody help me, I'm being spontaneous! || So, what's your tale, Mother Goose? Where ya from? || People need motivation to do anything. I don't think human beings learn anything without desperation. || I've never been one to sit back and go, ""I'd better do what the audience wants me to do, because I don't want to lose them."" || Creative people don't behave very well generally. If you're looking for examples of good relationships in show business, you're gonna be depressed real fast. I don't have time for anything else right now but work and my daughter. She's my first priority. || Morgan Freeman is so class. He's so cool. He's so scary. || My upbringing in Canada made me the person I am. I will always be proud to be a Canadian. || Ya know what I do almost every day? I wash. Personal hygiene is part of the package with me. || It's nice to finally get scripts offered to me that aren't the ones Tom Hanks wipes his butt with. || Nice jump, Spider-Man! || This country has helped define me and make my dreams come true. || Well, don't dig to deep or you might get burnt by the molten lava! || I wake up some mornings and sit and have my coffee and look out at my beautiful garden, and I go, ""Remember how good this is. Because you can lose it."" || Hey man. It's me again. I was just taking a whizz. Thought you might have called. Okay, later. || 50 years: here's a time when you have to separate yourself from what other people expect of you, and do what you love. Because if you find yourself 50 years old and you aren't doing what you love, then what's the point? || My focus is to forget the pain of life. Forget the pain, mock the pain, reduce it. And laugh. || Dry land is not a myth. I've seen it. Kevin Costner. Waterworld. I don't know what the big fuss is about. I saw that movie nine times. It rules! || The early bird gathers no moss! The rolling stone catches the worm. || I enjoy fame except when I'm with my daughter. Kids stop me all the time and I don't want her to be jealous of the attention. Also, sometimes I just want to be left alone and I refuse to make rubber faces. That's when they start asking, ""What's the matter, man, don't you like your job?"" I say, ""Yeah, I like my job. But I also like having sex, and I'm not going to do that in front of you either."" || The inner child runs rampant. They're just smaller, that's all. || Friends, rodents, quadrupeds, lend me your rears! || Hey, maybe I'll give you a call sometime. Your number still 911? Aaaalrighty then. || All that I ask is that you do every little thing that pops into my head, while I enjoy the enormous fortune your parents left behind. || I have been the guy who has everything but yet is so one-track minded about what I want, that I can't see my blessings. || Listen, Pocahontas, unless you put your ear to the ground, you'll never hear the buffalo comin'! || My dad was like a stage mother he always pushed me to do what I wanted. || My family kinda hit the skids. We were experiencing poverty at that point. We all got a job, where the whole family had to work as security guards and janitors. And I just got angry. || I just wanna hang out. No big deal! || And He saw that it was good! || I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. You seem to prefer the latter. || Behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. || Life opens up opportunities to you, and you either take them or you stay afraid of taking them. || You might recognize this song as performed by Jefferson Airplane, in a little rockumentary called ""Gimme Shelter,"" about the Rolling Stones and their nightmare at Altamont. That night the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels had their way. Tonight, it's my turn. || I'm very in love, but I'm not going to jump up and down on your couch. I'm sorry. || The future is now! Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, or watch female wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend from Vietnam. There's no end to the possibilities! || I really believe in the philosophy that you create your own universe. I'm just trying to create a good one for myself. || He who hesitates, masturbates. || I was just blow drying my hair, thought I heard the phone ring. Ah... has that ever happened to you? Anyway... call me, we'll talk about it. || Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. || I hope everybody could get rich and famous and will have everything they ever dreamed of, so they will know that its not the answer. || And that's the way the cookie crumbles. || Free hot dogs here, all you can eat! Get your foot long and a bag of nuts! || My teacher in the seventh grade told me that if I didn't fool around during class, I could have 15 minutes at the end of the day to do a comedy routine. Instead of bugging everybody, I'd figure out my routine. And at the end of the day, I'd get to perform in front of my entire class. I thought it was really smart of her. It's amazing how important that was. || One man's toxic waste is another man's potpourri. || Oh... that! I wasn't gonna just... ram it home, you know. I was gonna... lube it up and ease it in there, inch by inch, like a gentleman. || I wanted to be a veterinarian for about a week of my life when I was a kid. But I found out about the whole euthanasia thing and I said, ""I can't commit to that, sorry!"" || Always turn your wheel in the direction of the skid. || Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating. || I don't think you can know God unless you're passionate about him so you're either screaming at him, enraptured with the idea of being around him or feeling him in your life. || Either you're the one erasing or you're the one being erased. || I know this sounds strange, but as a kid, I was really shy. Painfully shy. The turning point was freshman year, when I was the biggest geek alive. No one, I mean no one, even talked to me. || I really want to love somebody. I do. I just don't know if it's possible forever and ever. || I got a lot of support from my parents. That's the one thing I always appreciated. They didn't tell me I was being stupid; they told me I was being funny. || I refuse to feel guilty. I feel guilty about too much in my life but not about money. I went through periods when I had nothing, so somebody in my family has to get stinkin' wealthy. || I just want to be myself. || You know, I think you're a very special unit. || She just gave blood and she's still got enough to fill up her face. || Don't you get it? Someone has to save all the other cable boys and girls, someone has to kill the babysitter. || Holy Testicle Tuesday! || New management came in and they cleaned everybody out so we hit the skids. We lived in a van, so I kind of know what happens to people when this happens. || Green Eggs and Ham was the story of my life. I wouldn't eat a thing when I was a kid, but Dr. Suess inspired me to try cauliflower. || Most of the time I live with my pain. I have pain but I won't show it around. I think that's the nobility of the character. There's something noble in not spewing on people all the time about your problems. I'm the light guy, so I identified. || How about you go over and introduce yourself, build me up, that way I don't have to brag about myself later. || Those times in life when you're terrified are the mastery times. || I don't think anybody should go through life without a team of psychologists. I have been through times when I'm literally squatting in the living room, having one of those open-throated cries, where you're crying all the way to your butthole. I always believed I would come out of it, though. || We had problems like all families but we had a lot of love. I was extremely loved. We always felt we had each other. || For some reason I did something where I realized I could get a reaction. That was when I broke out of my shell at school, because I really didn't have any friends or anything like that and I just kind of was going along, and then finally I did this zany thing, and all of a sudden I had tons of friends. || I've arrived at the place if I'm not taking a career risk, I'm not happy. If I'm scared, then I know I'm being challenged. || Life is an ordeal, albeit an exciting one, but I wouldn't trade it for the good old days of poverty and obscurity. || What I have in common with the character in ""Truman"" is this incredible need to please people. I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started. || The name's Hank, !@#$% face, learn it! || Caaaaaaaable guuuuuuy! || Now you know the house rules, no !@#$% after eleven || I absolutely want to have a career where you make'em laugh and make'em cry. It's all theater. || There's new territory, there's new places to go, new things to explore. Why stay back there? Maybe it will take three films to find another character that is really totally original, but I've got a lifetime, so why waste it just repeating myself. || I'm the first to admit this whole salary thing is getting out of control. In the final analysis, it's still about the work. || The money can be a hindrance to someone like me because the danger is that you start thinking, ""Is that a $20 million take?"" That kind of thing, and being self-critical. || Here it goes: I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit a Chevy, I sped some more, I failed to yeild at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I changed lanes without signaling while running a red light and speeding! || A lot of good love can happen in ten years. || Price check on Vagiclean, aisle five. I repeat: price check on Vagiclean, aisle five. That's Vagiclean. We've got a customer down here with a full-on fallopian fungus. She's baking a loaf of bread and I think it's sourdough. || Come back here, so that I may brain thee! || Wake up, little snoozy. Smell the smelling salts? Ha ha ha. I'll juice ya up. || Wake up, little snoozy. Smell the smelling salts? Ha ha ha. I'll juice ya up. || What are you waiting for? An engraved invitation? || That's the trouble with being me. At this point, nobody gives a damn what my problem is. I could literally have a tumor on the side of my head and they'd be like, ""Yeah, big deal. I'd eat a tumor every morning for the kinda money you're pulling down."" || I used to draw a lot. If my mother would ask me to do something else, I'd have a hairy conniption. I'd just go crazy. || I need privacy. I would think that because what I do makes a lot of people happy that I might deserve a little bit of respect in return. Instead, the papers try to drag me off my pedestal. || I'm a hard guy to live with. I'm like a caged animal. I'm up all night walking around the living room. It's hard for me to come down from what I do. || Before I do anything, I think, well what hasn't been seen. Sometimes, that turns out to be something ghastly and not fit for society. And sometimes that inspiration becomes something that's really worthwhile. || There was a time when people said, ""Jim, if you keep on making faces, your face will freeze like that."" Now they just say, ""Pay him!"" || Ever since I started to get recognition I've picked out certain fans and reverse-stalked them. || If I had never ventured beyond being a stand-up comic, then I would be sitting in my house today working on my Leonardo DiCaprio impression. || You know, I live a monastic lifestyle. No, I do. I do live in extremes, basically. I go back and forth. Once every six months, I'll have a day where I eat more chocolate than has ever been consumed by a human being. || But, you know, you can't be a star at home. || I want to be the greatest actor that ever lived, frankly. I'd love that. But I don't need to be. I just want to be here. That's it. || Originality is really important. || I haven't been as wild with my money as somebody like me might have been. I've been very safe, very conservative with investments. I don't blow money. I don't have a ton of houses. I know things can go away. I've already had that experience. || One thing I hope I'll never be is drunk with my own power. And anybody who says I am will never work in this town again. || I don't make it in regular channels, and that's okay for me. || Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac. || Good morning! And in case I don't see you: good afternoon, good evening and good night."
Joan Rivers,"I will only praise someone who can't take anything away from me. || If you're saying the same line 10 times and making it look like you just came up with it, that's acting. || Ginger did everything Fred did, only backwards and in High Heels! || Put me up against Sarah Silverman and I could take her. || Every television show you go on is a choice. || The worst thing that ever happened to me on stage is someone ran forward to tell me they loved me and projectile vomited all over the stage. It was horrible. || Thank God we're living in a country where the sky's the limit, the stores are open late and you can shop in bed thanks to television. || I hate reality shows that are not reality. || The thing is, I'm happiest when I'm on stage. || I just love acting. || I lived to be on stage, and I'm terrified. Terrified before every show. || I was a Brownie Scout mother. || What are people going to do? Fire me? I've been fired before. Not book me? I've been out of work before. I don't care. || I was not an attractive child. || I finally found out how priests get holy water. They boil the hell out of it. || Welcome to my world! I've been through it all, and I often pinch myself to believe my luck. I design jewlery, create cosmetics, perform comedy, act, lecture, write books, travel, have a fabulous daughter, and a phenomenal grandson-and I feel I'm the luckiest woman on the planet. || Looking fifty is great - if you're sixty. || I don't think I'm good in bed. My husband never said anything, but after we made love he'd take a piece of chalk and outline my body. || Grandchildren can be fucking annoying. How many times can you go 'And the cow goes moo and the pig goes oink'? It's like talking to a supermodel. || All I can think of are her poor parents. The shame, the shame of the Hilton family. To have your daughter do a porno film… in a Marriott hotel. || I have so little sex appeal my gynaecologist calls me ""sir"". || I once dated a guy who was so dumb he couldn't count to twenty-one unless he was naked. || I bought a pedigree dog for 300$. My friend said, ""Give me 300$ and I'll shit on your carpet."" || My mother could make anybody feel guilty - she used to get letters of apology from people she didn't even know. || A woman went to a plastic surgeon and asked him to make her like Bo Derek. He gave her a labotomy. || Why women don't blink during foreplay... not enough time. || Once you begin to believe there is help ""out there,"" you will know it to be true. || A child of one can be taught not to do certain things such as touch a hot stove, turn on the gas, pull lamps off their tables by their cords, or wake mommy before noon. || She's so pure, Moses couldn't even part her knees. || He who limps is still walking. || Elizabeth Taylor has more chins than the Chinese telephone directory. || Because I'm the only performer who comes out and says I've had plastic surgery, I've become the plastic surgery poster girl, which is hilarious, because everybody has done it and they all deny it. They stand there, like the Bride of Frankenstein, they've all got stitches, and they all say, 'I've done nothing.' I talk about it. || I tried to contact Johnny to reconcile our friendship, a million times, but he just wasn't having it. When he passed away, I felt such a crushing blow, that things were still unresolved. Johnny was a dear friend, I wish things would've ended different, this just was not worth it. || Victoria Beckham should get a life, I am not a fan of outrageous consumption. I think it is vulgar. And no-one should flaunt that they have a hundred Hermes $12,000 bags. Not when people are starving. Everyone should be allowed to have a great time but she shows a distinct lack of class. || The average airplane is 16 years old, and so is the average airplane meal. || If you're going to be a romantic idol and try to get every teenage girl to love you, then you'd be an ass to come out and say you're gay. Ricky Martin was so smart. He did what he did, made his millions and then he said, Guess what, every body? I'm gay... It didn't matter anymore because he didn't have to bring in 16-year-old girls. || Both of my parents got to see me host Carson, thank God. That's all anyone wants: to have their parents see they're going to be all right in life. || I have no sex appeal; if my husband didn't toss and turn, we'd never have had the kid. || There is not one female comic who was beautiful as a little girl. || Never be afraid to laugh at yourself, after all, you could be missing out on the joke of the century. || I'm not saying she's easy, but she's been in so many motel rooms her nickname is 'Gideon.' || A girl, you're 30 years old, you're not married - you're an old maid. A man, he's 90 years old, he's not married - he's a catch. || All Angelina Jolie wants to do is do good for people. And she was saying to me: ""If I could just make one person happy, Joan, I'll die satisfied."" I said: ""Easy! Just give Jennifer Aniston back her husband."" || The only time a woman has a true orgasm is when she is shopping. || When a man has a birthday, he takes a day off. When a woman has a birthday, she takes at least three years off. || My best birth control now is just to leave the lights on. || And since we’re all adults here, let’s be brutally honest – most babies are not actually attractive. In fact, they’re weird and freakish looking. A large percentage of them are squinty-eyed and bald and their faces are all mushed toegther, kind of like Renee Zellweger pushed up against a glass window. || I'm in nobody's circle, I've always been an outsider. || Boy George is all England needs - another queen who can't dress. || I succeeded by saying what everyone else is thinking. || I've had so much plastic surgery, when I die they will donate my body to Tupperware. || Once I was having lunch in a fancy restaurant with Lily Tomlin and Richard Pryor. We were all struggling comics together and the day we had lunch, any one of us could have picked up the check. That's when I knew I'd made it. || Florida wants to change the state's motto to attract younger people. They're thinking about: ""More than just a great place to die."" || Madonna is so hairy - when she lifted her arm, I thought it was Tina Turner in her armpit. || Don't cook. Don't clean. No man will ever make love to a woman because she waxed the linoleum. ""My God, the floor's immaculate! Lie down, you hot bitch."" || Comediennes are the lucky ones, because if you're funny, you can be 125 years old and they will still accept you. || I hate the term 'partner.' 'Yes, we're partners... This is my life partner, Teddy.' Jacoby & Meyers are partners. Ben & Jerry are partners. Bausch + Lomb are partners. You and Teddy are fuck-buddies. || I spit on education. No man will ever put his hand up your dress looking for a library card. || Life is very tough. If you don't laugh, it's tough. || Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is God's gift, that's why we call it the present. || Our natures are a lot like oil, mix us with anything else, and we strive to swim on top. || I am furious about everything. || Don't tell your kids you had an easy birth or they won't respect you. For years I used to wake up my daughter and say, 'Melissa you ripped me to shreds. Now go back to sleep.' || I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them. || I have no methods; all I do is accept people as they are. || Before we make love my husband takes a pain killer. || The first time I see a jogger smiling, I'll consider it. || I told my mother-in-law that my house was her house, and she said, 'Get the hell off my property.' || I was getting dressed and a peeping Tom looked in the window, took a look and pulled down the shade. || I hate thin people; ""Oh, does the tampon make me look fat?"" || My parents hated me. All I ever heard was, ""Why can't you be like your cousin Shelia? Why can't you be like your cousin Shelia?"" Shelia had died at birth. || Remember a few years ago when they left Bea Arthur out of the death reel at the Oscars? Bea Arthur! How did they leave Bea Arthur out? She was in Mame; she was in All in the Family; she was in Maude; she was a Golden Girl, for God's sake! Bea was not only one of Hollywood's leading ladies, she was one of Hollywood's leading men! || Bo Derek turned down the role of Helen Keller because she couldn't remember the lines. || Knock me out with the first pain, and wake me up when the hairdresser arrives. || My love life is like a piece of Swiss cheese. Most of it's missing, and what's there stinks. || When you first get married, they open the car door for you. Eighteen years now... once he opened the car door for me in the last four years - we were on the freeway at the time. || All my friends are dying. That's why I always wear black. || I have no sex appeal, which kills me. The only way I can ever hear heavy breathing from my husband's side of the bed is when he's having an asthma attack. || No steam or gas ever drives anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled. No life ever grows until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined. || Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes had the baby. He was there for the birth. It would've been nice if he was there for the conception. || I knew I was an unwanted baby when I saw that my bath toys were a toaster and a radio. || Victoria Beckham is so nasty, why doesn't she just go home?! Her dresses are beautiful, but I don't care what she does. She's mean to all the people around her. She's too short to be a diva. We all use the same hairdressers, make-up artists, limo-drivers and greeters at the airports in LA and nobody has anything nice to say about her. They say she's rude. She can't always just be having a bad day. || The nice thing about Viagra is that they are proving men can go blind on it, so you can gain weight and have a great sex life. || You know you're getting old when work is a lot less fun and fun is a lot more work. || Every woman in this room tonight: Think like a second wife. You grab and you take. You grab and you take. And when you die, whatever you got out of him you have buried on you. If the next bitch wants it, make her dig for it. || If God wanted us to bend over he'd put diamonds on the floor. || People say that money is not the key to happiness, but I always figured if you have enough money, you can have a key made. || A man can sleep around, no questions asked, but if a woman makes nineteen or twenty mistakes she's a tramp. || My obstetrician was so dumb that when I gave birth he forgot to cut the cord. For a year that kid followed me everywhere. It was like having a dog on a leash. || My perfect last meal would be: shrimp cocktail, lasagna, steak, creamed spinach, salad with bleu cheese dressing, onion rings, garlic bread, and a dessert of strawberry shortcake. || If I found her floating in my pool, I'd punish my dog. || I've always hate child stars, starting from way back when, when I was a child. The first child star I saw was Shirley Temple. She was six years old, two foot six and the biggest star in Hollywood. She wore ribbons in her hair, and frilly little pinafores and shiny patent-leather tap shoes - just like the boys in Glee do. || I was so ugly that they sent my picture to Ripley's 'Believe It or Not' and he sent it back and said, 'I don't believe it.' || I had a Jewish delivery; they knock you out with the first pain; they wake you up when the hairdresser shows. || I'm going out with these old guys. One guy gave me a hickey and left his teeth in my neck. Another man, we were having a perfectly lovely dinner; he looked up and me and went: ""You're not my wife!"" Another guy died during dinner. I had to go in his pocket to get the American Express card. Then you wonder: ""What would he tip?"" Another guy said: ""I want you to meet my family,"" and took me to the cemetery. || The one thing women don't want to find in their stockings on Christmas morning is their husband. || Elizabeth Taylor's so fat she puts mayonnaise on aspirin. || My routines come out of total unhappiness. My audiences are my group therapy. || I have a wonderful psychiatrist that I see maybe once a year, because I don't need it. It all comes out onstage. || I think any celebrity that adopts a child from a third world country is a fool. || I think I'm in a business where you have to look good, and it's totally youth-oriented. || She doesn't understand the concept of Roman numerals. She thought we just fought in world war eleven. || Yeah, I read history. But it doesn't make you nice. Hitler read history, too. || Mick Jagger could French-kiss a moose. He has child-bearing lips. || I have become my own version of an optimist. If I can't make it through one door, I'll go through another door - or I'll make a door. Something terrific will come no matter how dark the present. || How stupid can you get? Christina must have been thinking about food, thats why she forgot the words. Shes gotten so big. She looks like she could eat Lady GaGa. Great way to get rid of competition. || Sold my house in LA, packed myself up and moved to New York, not knowing anybody. Friends are very hard to make after a certain age. || Trust your husband, adore your husband, and get as much as you can in your own name. || My husband wanted to be cremated. I told him I'd scatter his ashes at Neiman Marcus - that way, I'd visit him every day. || Forty for you, sixty for me. And equal partners we will be. || I hate Tom Cruise... In TV interviews Tom laughs inappropriately and much too vociferously at non-humorous declarative statements, which is ironic because in real life he can’t take a fucking joke at all. All you have to do is make one simple, little, harmless, innocuous aside like, 'The Scientology spaceship was late today; it had to stop by Fire Island to pick up Tom Cruise,' and he has a pack of lawyers at your door faster than Katie Holmes can say, 'No, really, he loves me in that way, I swear.' || Don't follow any advice, no matter how good, until you feel as deeply in your spirit as you think in your mind that the counsel is wise. || You know you're getting old when you buy a sexy sheer nightgown and don't know anyone who can see through it. || ""Where there is a will there is a way"" is an old true saying. He who resolves upon doing a thing, by that very resolution often scales the barriers to it, and secures its achievement. To think we are able, is almost to be so - to determine upon attainment is frequently attainment itself. || My earliest childhood memory was watching my parents loosen the wheels on my stoller. || Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I believe when a woman enters a room, men should stand up - and gay men should stand up at least halfway. || My daughter and I are very close. We speak every single day and I call her every day and I say the same thing, ""Pick up, I know you're there."" And she says the same thing back, ""How'd you get this new number?"" || Valentine’s Day is different for old people. At this age I receive chocolates in boxes shaped like artificial hearts. || She loves me so much, my daughter. She doesn't want me to be lonely; isn't that nice? She's trying to fix me up with Robert Blake. || You know you've reached middle age when you're cautioned to slow down by your doctor, instead of by the police. || My husband killed himself. And it was my fault. We were making love and I took the bag off my head. || My sex life is so bad, my G-spot has been declared a historical landmark. || I was the last girl in Larchmont, NY to get married. My mother had a sign up: ""Last Girl Before Freeway."" || Having my daughter I screamed for twenty-three hours straight. And that was just during conception. || I want them to know I don't think I'm wonderful, or better than they are. Part of comedy is saying: 'I am you and you are me, and we're all feeling the same thing.' || I like colonic irrigation because sometimes you find old jewellery. || I said to my husband, my boobs have gone, my stomach's gone, say something nice about my legs. He said, ""Blue goes with everything."" || I was so flat I used to put Xs on my chest and write, ""You are here"". I wore angora sweaters just so the guys would have something to pet. || Anger is a symptom, a way of cloaking and expressing feelings too awful to experience directly - hurt, bitterness, grief, and, most of all, fear. || Don't talk to me about Valentines Day. At my age an affair of the heart is a bypass! || Is Elizabeth Taylor fat? Her favorite food is seconds. || I don't think there'd be a Tina Fey now if I hadn't tried to look good in the beginning. || I could be the Greta Garbo of comedy, very secluded, but Garbo had a man who was beyond rich to support her. || It's so long since I've had sex I've forgotten who ties up who. || Diets, like clothes, should be tailored to you. || I enjoy life when things are happening. I don't care if it's good things or bad things. That means you're alive. || I was smart enough to go through any door that opened. || The ideal beauty is a fugitive which is never found. || Never floss with a stranger. || I hate housework! You make the beds, you do the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again. || I blame my mother for my poor sex life. All she told me was 'the man goes on top and the woman underneath.' For three years my husband and I slept in bunk beds. || For as one star another far exceeds, so souls in heaven are placed by their deeds. || I said to my husband, ""Why don't you call out my name when we're making love?"" He said, ""I don't want to wake you up."" || That's how I meet new men. The minute it says 'Sadie Schwartz' I know, 'Go to that funeral.' || I wish I had a twin, so I could know what I'd look like without plastic surgery. || My boobs are so low I had to put curb feelers on my nipples! || The only street I like is Rue Honore de Balzac, because 'Balzac' sound so gay, and I love my gays. I might like Parisians more if they named their streets only for gay icons, like Rue Liza Minnelli or Rue Bette Midler or, my favorite, Rue McClanahan. || I love gay and lesbian parents. But I think we need a law that says lesbians and gay men have to raise their children together. This way, the kids would not only know how to build bookshelves, but they'd also instinctively know how to decorate them. || Does fashion matter? Always - though not quite as much after death. || Everyone thinks Angelina Jolie was the first celebrity baby hoarder, but she wasn't. Before Angelina there was Mia Farrow. Mia had an entire farm full of children. I think she got them at Costco. || Gay marriage - I am so against it because all my gay friends are out. And if they get married, it will cost me a fortune in gifts. || My parents just didn't like me. Till I was 9, my mother was trying to get an abortion. That sticks with you. That hurts. She said to her doctor, 'Is there any possible way to get rid of this thing?' || I am so out of the loop. I am never honored. My career is hilarious to me. I am either under the radar or over the radar. || If he's stuck with the shrew, I hope he screws everything that's not tied down. || I use a smoke alarm as a timer. || I am a dyke! And I'm damn proud of it! || It's common courtesy; he's doing most of the work; you've got to encourage him. || My body is falling so fast my gynaecologist wears a hard hat. || My face has been tucked in more times than a bedsheet at the Holiday Inn. || She's so fat, she's my two best friends. || The fashion magazines are suggesting that women wear clothes that are 'age appropriate'. For me that would be a shroud. || I was dating a transvestite, and my mother said, 'Marry him, you'll double your wardrobe.' || Joan Collins told a reporter that she hasn't had plastic surgery; come on... she's had more tucks than a motel bedsheet! || If you don’t want gays in the military, make the uniforms ugly. || If you're not a wreck in this business, you're not around."
Joey Bishop,"You can cut your hair how you want, but I think you should get to where you wear it normal for the future. || A woman driver went through a red light. The cop stopped her and said, ""Lady, didn't you see that red light?"" The woman said, ""You've seen one, you've seen them all."" || The president of a TV network generously agreed to take his company's aptitude test, a test required of all the personnel. He did badly. As a result he was in a sullen mood for the rest of the day. When he got home that night, his wife asked why he looked so grouchy. ""I took the company's aptitude test this morning."" ""What did it show?"" asked the wife. ""It showed,"" boomed the executive, ""that such tests are idiotic. That's what it showed."" || Last week I gave Dean Martin a cigarette lighter. He finished it in one gulp. || The other day I drove home filled with pride and a sense of achievement. I entered the house, and there was my mother. ""Mama,"" I said proudly, ""I have a new Corvette outside."" Mama looked at me, shook her head and said sadly: ""Please, Joey. Don't bring her in."" || My doctor is wonderful. Once, in 1955, when I couldn't afford an operation, he touched up the X-rays. || The kick of comedy is to think quickly. It's a great kick. || You know how Van Nuys got its name? Well, one day my little old Jewish mother was visiting me, and I took her to the top of the Hollywood Hills and had her view the valley below just at sunset. ""Well, mama, what would you call that?"" And she said, ""Ver nize."" || Today you can go to a gas station and find the cash register open and the toilets locked. They must think toilet paper is worth more than money. || I love Chicago. I got on a bus and asked the driver, ""Do you go to the Loop?"" He said, ""No, I go beep-beep!"" || The other day I started to take a course in psycho-ceramics. What is psycho-ceramics? It's the study of crackpots. || I don't consider success doing a show for 30 years; I'm sorry. To me, you're successful when you graduate from something. I did a series, I did a talk show, I did movies, I replaced Mickey Rooney on Broadway in ""Sugar Babies."" You understand? || I once called my mother during a hurricane. She got on the phone and said, ""I can't talk to you, Joey, the lines are down."" || A salesman called on my wife the other day and tried to sell her a freezer. ""You'll save a fortune on your food bills,"" he promised. ""I can't tell you how much you'll save. It'll be tremendous."" Said my wife: ""I'm sure you're right, but we're already saving a fortune with our new car by not taking the bus. We're saving a fortune with our new washing machine by not sending out the laundry. We're saving a fortune with our new dishwasher by giving up the maid. The plain truth is that right now we just can't afford to save any more!"""
Johnny Carson,"Happiness is discovering the prune juice your doctor ordered you to drink has fermented. || She doesn't need a steak knife. Rona Barrett cuts her food with her tongue. || May a sacred cow leave a night deposit in your front yard. || I now believe in reincarnation. Tonight's monologue is going to come back as a dog. || Happiness is a tiger in your tank and a pussycat in your back seat. || He's so fat, he can be his own running mate. || The only thing money gives you is the freedom of not worrying about money. || The difference between a divorce and a legal separation is that a legal separation gives a husband time to hide his money. || It was so hot today I saw a robin dipping his worm in Nestea. || I hated my last boss. He asked, ""Why are you two hours late?"" I said, ""I fell downstairs."" He said, ""That doesn't take two hours."" || Happiness is sitting down to watch slides of your neighbor's vacation and finding out he spent two weeks at a nudist colony. || If variety is the spice of life, marriage is the big can of leftover Spam. || I was so naive as a kid I used to sneak behind the barn and do nothing. || Democracy means free television, not good television, but free. || The worst gift is a fruitcake. There is only one fruitcake in the entire world, and people keep sending it to each other. || Democracy is the eagle on the back of a dollar bill, with 13 arrows in one claw, 13 leaves on a branch, 13 tail feathers, and 13 stars over its head - this signifies that when the white man came to this country, it was bad luck for the Indians, bad luck for the trees, bad luck for the wildlife, and lights out for the American eagle. || Thanksgiving is an emotional holiday. People travel thousands of miles to be with people they only see once a year. And then discover once a year is way too often. || Did you know Richard Nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist? || Adults ask questions as a child does. When you stop wondering, you might as well put your rocker on the front porch and call it a day. || I started in a gaseous state and then I cooled. || I would like to say, for the record, that I am in favor of using more American Indians and other minorities in motion pictures, I am against polluting the oceans of the world, I am for every nationality having its own homeland, I am against whacking baby seals on the head, and I am for saving the whales.  || I think it would be a fatal mistake to use my show as a platform for controversial issues. I'm an entertainer, not a commentator. If you're a comedian your job is to make people laugh. || Welcome to the Academy Awards, a glittering two hours of entertainment, spread out over four hours. For those of you taping this on Betamax, you're under arrest. || Democracy is buying a big house you can't afford with money you don't have to impress people you wish were dead. And, unlike communism, democracy does not mean having just one ineffective political party; it means having two ineffective political parties. || May you have the income of a Republican and the sex life of a Democrat! || Last night, it was so cold, the flashers in New York were only describing themselves. || Some sad news from Australia... the inventor of the boomerang grenade died today. || He doesn't dye his hair, he bleaches his face. || Only lie about the future. || I hear that whenever someone in the White House tells a lie, Nixon gets a royalty. || He couldn't ad-lib a fart after a baked-bean dinner. || May your only son become a goalie on a nudist hockey team. || It was so cold, the politicians had their hands in their own pockets. || The Hollywood tradition I like best is called sucking up to the stars. || I see a lot of new faces. Especially on the old faces. || I know a man who gave up smoking, drinking, sex, and rich food. He was healthy right up to the day he killed himself. || And then mommy's lawyer does to daddy what daddy was doing to the nurse. || I feel the one sensible thing you can do is try to live in a way that pleases you. If you don't hurt anybody else, what you do is your own business. || There was this billy goat at a movie studio who found and ate a can of film. When a nanny asked him how he liked it, he said, ""It was all right but I liked the book better."" || It was so hot today I saw a pigeon walking in the shadow of Orson Welles. || Never use a big word when a little filthy one will do. || Talent alone won't make you a success. Neither will being in the right place at the right time, unless you are ready. The most important question is: ""Are your ready?"" || We have two kinds of air: regular and chunky style. || Democracy is welcoming people from other lands, and giving them something to hold onto - usually a mop or a leaf blower. || I never analyze it. Analyzing it would just be a waste of time. I just go out and do it. || Happiness is seeing your son drafted the same day he's been accepted to an expensive college. || If it weren't for Philo T. Farnsworth, inventor of television, we'd still be eating frozen radio dinners. || Your chances of getting hit by lighting go up if you stand under a tree, shake your fist at the sky, and say ""Storms suck!"" || To this day I can't get aroused until I see a pair of rubber dice hanging from the mirror. || I can empathize with President George Bush. I know what it feels like having a young guy waiting around for you to keel over. || I wanted the show to make the most of being the last area of television that the medium originally was supposed to be - live, immediate entertainment. I decided the best thing I could do was forget trying to do a lot of pre-planning. It all boiled down to just going out there and being my natural self and seeing what would happen. || I'm often asked, 'What is your favorite moment during the 30 years you hosted The Tonight Show?' I really don't have just one. The times I enjoyed the most were the spontaneous, unplanned segments that just happened, like Ed Ames' infamous 'Tomahawk Toss' that produced one of the longest laughs in television history. When these lucky moments happen, you just go with them and enjoy the experience and high of the moment. || If life was fair, Elvis would be alive and all the impersonators would be dead. || An oxymoron? What's that? A moron who studies at Oxford? || Ed and I were out last night and I asked him why he drank so much. He said he drank to forget. I asked him, ""To forget what?"" And he said he couldn't remember. || When turkeys mate they think of swans. || Mail your packages early so the post office can lose them in time for Christmas. || In Hollywood if you don't have a shrink, people think you're crazy. || There is a power struggle going on between President Reagan's advisers. Moe and Curly are out. Larry is still in. || And so it has come to this. I am one of the lucky people in the world. I found something that I always wanted to do and I have enjoyed every single minute of it. || I am taking the applause sign home, putting it in the bedroom. || It was so hot today that Burger King was singing, ""if you want it your way, cook it yourself."" || People will pay more to be entertained than educated. || Happiness is being stuck in an elevator and discovering the ravishing blonde with you is a liquor salesman with a case of samples. || I have an ego like anybody else, but I don't need to be stoked by going before the public all the time. || Read my lips: No new promises. || We're more effective than birth control pills. || Egyptian President Sadat had a belly dancer entertain President Nixon at a state dinner. Mr. Nixon was really impressed. He hadn't seen contortions like that since Rose Mary Woods. || Anytime four New Yorkers get into a cab together without arguing, a bank robbery has just taken place. || I know you've been married to the same woman for 69 years. That is marvelous. It must be very inexpensive. || In Los Angeles, the big story is that Police Chief Daryl Gates announced his retirement. It'll be sometime next year. Why can't a guy just retire without making a big deal of it? || Find me any performer anywhere who isn't egocentric. You'd better believe you're good, or you've got no business being out there. || Nancy Reagan fell down and broke her hair. || That would have been a great ticket, Reagan and Ford - an actor and a stuntman. || You get the feeling that Dan Quayle's golf bag doesn't have a full set of irons? || Happiness is being served with a paternity suit on your 75th birthday. || If God didn't want men to hunt, he wouldn't have given him plaid shirts. || Death is nature's way of telling us to slow down. || Never ask your wife if she still hears from her old pimp. || New York is an exciting town where something is happening all the time, most unsolved. || May a tse tse fly bite you where it counts. || A two-pound turkey and a fifty-pound cranberry - that's Thanksgiving dinner at Three-Mile Island. || Ronald Reagan just signed the new tax law. But I think he was in Hollywood too long. He signed it, 'Best wishes, Ronald Reagan.' || My success just evolved from working hard at the business at hand each day. || For days after death hair and fingernails continue to grow, but phone calls taper off. || The bad news is that aliens have landed... the good news is that they pee gasoline. || Married men live longer than single men. But married men are a lot more willing to die. || Never continue in a job you don't enjoy. If you're happy in what you're doing, you'll like yourself, you'll have inner peace. And if you have that, along with physical health, you will have had more success than you could possibly have imagined. || Happiness is your dentist telling you it won't hurt and then having him catch his hand in the drill. || Democracy means that anyone can grow up to be president, and anyone who doesn't grow up can be vice president. || May a holy man squat on your fez. || Happiness is seeing the muscular lifeguard all the girls were admiring leave the beach hand in hand with another muscular lifeguard."
Jon Stewart,"If America leads a blessed life, then why did God put all of our oil under people who hate us? || If you're going to give people 20 minutes of news satire, you've also got to give them Tiffani-Amber Thiessen or you're going to have rioting in the streets. || Here in the U.S., we've made democracy into a science. A cold, impersonal science. || Across the nation, thousands of people are lining up in hospital waiting rooms, out the doors, down the steps, around the corners, and behind the hedges, waiting for their inoculations. Here's another idea for avoiding the flu: don't stand outside in the cold for hours around lots of other people.  || If the guy in front of you at the polls has arm swords, you might want to considering filling out an absentee ballot. || If we are going to amend the constitution, shouldn't it be to keep the omos-hay from arrying-may? || Megachurches. I can't be the only one frightened when our houses of worship sound like they could take on Godzilla. || I masturbate. A lot. And yet, I don't floss because it’s too much of a hassle. Ten seconds of joy over a lifetime of tooth decay, that's what I've chosen. || I'm not a very serious Jew. I don't wear the protective religious headgear. They only wear that because 40% of all religious thoughts escape through the head. || Senator John McCain, who spent over five years in a Vietnamese POW camp, publicly releases 1,000 pages of medical records. Now people are left with only one nagging question: what kind of a freak has 1,000 pages of medical records. || Models talk to you for six minutes and they're very nice and they say thank you and then it's off to the larger European men they actually have sex with. || This is inarguably a failure of leadership from the top of the federal government. Remember when Bill Clinton went out with Monica Lewinsky. That was unarguably a failure of judgment at the top. Democrats had to come out and risk losing credibility if they did not condemn Bill Clinton for his behaviour. I believe Republicans are in the same position right now. And I will say this: Hurricane Katrina is George Bush’s Monica Lewinsky. The only difference is that tens of thousands of people weren’t stranded in Monica Lewinsky’s vagina. || President Bush announced his new economic plan. The centerpiece was a proposed repeal of the dividend tax on stocks, a boon that could be worth millions of dollars to average Americans. Well, average stock-owning Americans. Technically, Americans who own a significant amount of shares in dividend-dealing companies. Well, rich people, that's what I'm trying to say. They're going to do really well with this. || I'm doing everything I can to sabotage my career. It's a little thing called ""fear of success"". || Dick Cheney and Karl Rove, once two of the most powerful men in this country, are now suffering from Balzheimer's disease. Why didn't I see it before? Balzheimer's is a terrible illness that attacks the memory and gives its victims the balls to attack others for things they themselves made a career of. There is no known cure. || Several weeks ago, South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford disappeared without explanation for five days. Now of course, as it turns out, he didn't really disappear. It turns out he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. Which is a trail that starts in Maine and ends in an Argentine woman's vagina. || They said I wasn't being funny. And I said to them, 'I know that, but tomorrow I will go back to being funny, and your show will still blow.' || We could overcome the baser aspects of our nature... and give this planet the kind of caretakers it deserves. || Sheep are not considered the most intelligent animals but British scientist say humans may have underestimated the woolly creatures. In fact, the British scientific community is even suggesting that the animals might even be ""Irish-smart."" || Don't worry, as long as America still has natural resources, you guys are okay. || I don't know how it didn't work out. How can a man who like other men and a woman who drinks not get along? The interesting thing is: there is no conceivable amount of money worth telling the world that you were beaten up by Liza Minnelli. || The wisdom of the masses is not always wise. You could put a lot of things to a vote-you could have put anti-miscegenation laws to a vote, and that would have passed pretty handily. Either all people are created equal-or they're not. You're either buying into the original premise of America-or you're not. || I wish I could say there was a magic formula, but I just kept working at it. || When in doubt, I can stare blankly. The rubber face. There's only so many ways you can stare incredulously at the camera and tilt an eyebrow, but that's your old standby: What would Buster Keaton do? || I don't know what all the controversy is about, quite frankly. I've met Eminem, I met him backstage, and he's really gay. || This show is our own personal beliefs. || Everybody wrings their hands about Fox News. You know, ""fair and balanced? Why, that's snide!"" Yeah, okay, maybe they're not fair and balanced, but CNN used to have the slogan ""You Can Depend on CNN"". Guess what? I watch it, no you can't. So what's the difference? || Do you guys have to sell everything? I'd like to buy the Earth's core. || Nazi Germany was so destructive to Judaism not only for the loss of life, but because many who survived began to see the practice of Judaism as somewhat of a health hazard. || If the presidency is the head of the American body politic, Congress is its gastrointestinal tract. Its vast and convoluted inner workings may be mysterious and unpleasant, but in the end they excrete a great deal of material whose successful passage is crucial to our nation's survival. || You can always tell when Bush is in trouble. He always brings out 9/11. 9/11 is the cudgel that he waves. As far as he's concerned, it's ""Open Sesame"". 9/11 is his way of saying, ""Okay, I'm fucking up now, but remember four years ago? That was cool."" I think he thinks he can use it for anything. ""9/11. On 9/11 we were attacked. And so, I should get to bang your wife."" What? ""Now, there are some nay-sayers out there who think I shouldn't bang your wife, well, that's the cut-and-run crowd."" || As a comedian, as a person, as a citizen, as a mammal - in all of those areas, I am looking forward to the end of the Bush administration with every fiber of my being. || I am sick of deconstructing their propaganda, because it's pretty much the same as it's always been. It's just repeating something over and over again until we believe it and we hope that you believe it. || I can't control what people think this was. I can only tell you my intentions. This was not a rally to ridicule people of faith. Or people of activism or to look down our noses at the heartland or passionate argument or to suggest that times are not difficult and that we have nothing to fear. They are and we do. But we live now in hard times, not end times. And we can have animus and not be enemies. || If you want to know why I’m here and what I want from you I can only assure you this: you have already given it to me. Your presence was what I wanted. Sanity will always be and has always been in the eye of the beholder. To see you here today and the kind of people that you are has restored mine. Thank you. || Nineteen people flew into the towers. It seems hard for me to imagine that we could go to war enough to make the world safe enough that nineteen people wouldn't want to do harm to us. So it seems like we have to rethink a strategy that is less military-based. || You talk about the Pro-Life movement being one of the great shames of our nation. I think, if you want number two, I think - I think it's that. I think it's absolute - it's a travesty that people have forced someone who is gay to make their case that they deserve the same basic rights. || I think you are looking at sexuality and not attributes, and I think it's odd because the conservative mantra is a meritocracy. And I think what you're suggesting is the fact that being gay parents makes you not as good as others. And I would suggest that a loving, gay family with a financially secure background beats the hell out of Britney Spears and Kevin Federline any day of the week. || Although to be fair, cherry picking isn't quite what we do. Cherries are sweet and delicious. What we do is more turd mining. And I'll thank you to give our work the respect it deserves! || It's the inevitable consummation of this largely manufactured battle between a man who makes people laugh for a living and whatever people think I do. In a televised, two-part hatefuck that is, by all measure, bound to dissapoint anyone that's been following it. Catch the fever! || I can't rationalize the brilliance and knowledge that you have about the intricacies of the market with the crazy bullshit I see you do each night. || The CEO of a company lied to you. But isn't that financial reporting? || When are we going to realize in this country that our wealth is work? That we're workers, and by selling this idea of, ""Hey man, I'll teach you how to be rich"" - how is that any different than an infomercial? || When my syndicated show got canceled, the next day I still knew how to write jokes. That was a huge revelation. Because at first you think, ""I won't have any shelter! What am I gonna do? The sun is hot. Very thirsty."" || That whole thing has been overstated by environmentalists. First of all, what is it, rocks and snow? C'mon, what is that, you want that? Go to Canada my friend. Believe me, rocks and snow are overrated. I've seen otters - they look better covered in oil.  || When you're accustomed to doing stand-up, so often you're the only person onstage and it's all your thing. It's very gladiatorial. Obviously, when you're in a scene with somebody, you're supposed to listen and react - and that's a bit of a transition. || I would think black people think everything is about race. They are the ones who are on the outside of the game. They are the ones who face it every day. || I'm a little bit too obsessed with the news. I find the news easier to follow than narrative entertainment programs. || Do you know what writing a book is? It's sitting alone in a room for weeks without making contact with another human. I felt like Howard Hughes. || Sitting around with funny people, banging out jokes and creating a television show. I have no hobbies, no outside interests. I'm fine with spending 14 hours a day putting a show together with tape and string. || I know change can be painful. But from change comes growth. || The real focus at first is to just become a good stand-up comedian, and then when you get to a certain level, then they allow you to do other things. You feel if you're overwhelmed by something or if you're not. || The goals for me have changed somewhat. There's a bit of seduction to the idea of being on network, but it got to the point where that wasn't important. What's important is doing something worthwhile. Which is why I've always avoided being on a sitcom. Yeah, it's high-profile and it's on a network, but you know what? You could be on Suddenly Stewart. || High school. You know, people say, 'I'll never do so-and-so again' - then they do it. So what? Sometimes somebody has crack, and you're looking to stay awake. || If I could be really competent, that goes such a long way toward things, because the majority of things are not competent. If I can be competent, and have moments of originality, that's all I would ask for. || But the main thing I don't want to be is un-funny. That's really the mandate. Just whatever we're doing, make it as funny as we can possibly make it. And believe me, if the show starts going down, we'll introduce a baby. We'll do everything that they did on `Family Ties.' I'm not afraid of that. || The disasters build a sort of odd Diacid feeling. When my syndicated show got canceled, the next day I still knew how to write jokes. That was a huge revelation. Because at first you think, 'I won't have any shelter! What am I gonna do? The sun is hot. Very thirsty.' || I’m not going to censor myself to comfort your ignorance. || Good evening everybody, ladies, gentlemen... Felicity. || Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is a rare commodity in this day and age. And let the chips fall where they may. || My life is a series of Hollywood orgies and Kabbalah center brunches with the cast of Friends. At least that’s what my handlers tell me. I’m actually too valuable to live my own life and spend most of my days in a vegetable crisper to remain fake news anchor fresh. || If there’s anyone out there involved in illegal movie piracy... don't do it. Take a good look at these people. These are the people you're stealing from. Look at them! Face what you've done! There are women here who can barely afford enough gown to cover their breasts. || Get a sense of humor. If you don't, it'll be incredibly frustrating. || Why is it that if you take advantage of a tax break and you're a corporation, you're a smart businessman, but if you take advantage of something you need to not be hungry, you're a moocher? || Any fool can blow something up. Any fool can destroy. But to see these guys, these firefighters and these policemen and people from all over the country, literally with buckets, rebuilding... that’s extraordinary. And that’s why we have already won... they can't... it's light. It’s democracy. They can't shut that down. || Yon Kippur. Greatest Jewish holiday ever. The Jewish day of attonement. You don't ear for one day, all your sins for the year are wiped clean. Beat that with your little ""Lent."" What is Lent? Forty days of absolution. Forty days to one day. Even in sin you're paying retail. || A half-hour show almost doesn't do it justice. There is so much material out there. The 24-hour news networks are talking about news analysis when they have no vested interest in news. They have vested interest in fanning the flames of conflict because that's what gets them ratings. That's what keeps them on the air. || Remember that guy who got gored by a bull and the bull pulled his underwear off and he had to run around the ring naked? If that footage comes out, I'll run that. || I like not to be good at anything, so I keep hopping around. || I probably owe you guys, like, five bucks. || Because sometimes ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX NEWS, MSNBC, CNN, HEADLINE NEWS, CSPAN, and CSPAN 2 just aren't enough. || I'm ""The Guy Who Seems to Be Ruining All Media."" || There's always anxiety when you start a new job, you're the one guy who doesn't know where the ketchup is. || My secret now is to try and make sure that my girlfriend, Tracey, is out of the house when I bring my dates home. That can be awkward. || I have a lot of hostility. || I really enjoyed doing the book, but you don't get any reinforcement. You just sit in a room being yourself for a long time, and it's hard to get comfortable with that. The idea of getting back in there in a room with a bunch of funny people and just cranking out jokes is just really appealing to me. || I always get that cautionary warning right before I get off the phone with an interviewer. It's: 'Good luck with the show. I really like it, and if this goes wrong, you'll be hearing from my attorneys.' || You feel kind of weird cheering for chaos. There is that sense that the crazier it gets, the better off we are. Before, when I was part of the American public, I was hoping for a reasonable and quick solution to the impeachment process. Now, I'm hoping for partisan bedlam and chaos. It's really what serves me best. || Whenever you take over something that is popular and has a fanatical following that loves it, you're never going to please everyone. The trick is to have enough wherewithal to follow through with what you want to do with it and give it time to evolve. || At first the difference will be in whatever atmosphere I bring into it. It's not going to be like, 'I really want to do The Daily Show and I'd love to turn it into an abstract musical.' I like the format and the chance to satirize the news. || The currency of this show is your own head. They've established a certain structure here, but it's still in evolution. || I really like to put my name on everything, so my roommate doesn't steal it. It's really a throwback to that. || Never name it after yourself. Maybe we'll throw a ""with"" in there. That seems to work. Like Late Show With David Letterman. || If you don't get it right with your first family, you can always do it again with another. || You never hear a woman say, 'Hey, lets go to balls.' || Everyone just needs to get over themselves. || As we approach the millennium with sort of the idea that society is going to start spiraling into chaos, I'd love to be making jokes about that. Who wants to miss out on that? If the world is going to end, I want to be there the night before, goofing off. || Hopefully the only things off-limits are crummy jokes, but being a standup comedian, I know that's not always the case... You know it when you have to take a shower afterward. || If you try to hit a grand slam, you're going to strike out. || The Internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom. || You wake up and you're still a little drunk and you can't believe that hot girl from last night actually has a beard and a penis. || What is the fear of the 'gay agenda' that has so upset people? Do people think that if gay people are given a place at the table, they'll be so convincing we'll all end up blowing them? What is the issue? 'You know, I'm straight, but you've made such a convincing argument...' || I don't care about wealth. What seems to be upsetting is institutionalizing the advantages that wealth gives you. || I've always liked Atlanta. And not just for the strip clubs, but the shopping and the food. || I'm too short to host a late-night talk show. It's like the bar at an amusement-park ride. You have to be six foot two or over. || If you watch the news and don't like it, then this is your counter program to the news. || We have it. The smoking gun. The evidence. The potential weapon of mass destruction we have been looking for as our pretext of invading Iraq. There's just one problem - it's in North Korea. || I can be in 20 movies. But I'll never be an actor. || I was born with an adult head and a tiny body. Like a 'Peanuts' character. || I'm thrilled to be asked to host the Academy Awards for the second time because, as they say, the third time's a charm. || There is no such thing as an impartial jury because there are no impartial people. There are people that argue on the web for hours about who their favorite character on ""Friends"" is. || McVeigh's lawyer got him the death penalty, which, quite frankly, I could have done. || Our culture is just a series of checks and balances. The whole idea that we're in a battle between tyranny and freedom - it's a series of pendulum swings. || President Bush remained undeterred by the massive display of American opposition, even though much of it came from the hundreds of thousands of voters who supported him by voting for Nader. || The seven marvels that best represent man's achievements over the last 2,000 years will be determined by Internet vote... so look for Howard Stern's Private Parts to come in No. 1. || There are a hell of a lot of jobs that are scarier than live comedy. Like standing in the operating room when a guy's heart stops, and you're the one who has to fix it! || Yesterday, the president met with a group he calls the coalition of the willing. Or, as the rest of the world calls them, Britain and Spain. || Yes, the long war on Christianity. I pray that one day we may live in an America where Christians can worship freely! In broad daylight! Openly wearing the symbols of their religion... perhaps around their necks? And maybe - dare I dream it? - maybe one day there can be an openly Christian President. Or, perhaps, 43 of them. Consecutively. || You have to remember one thing about the will of the people: it wasn't that long ago that we were swept away by the Macarena. || I celebrated Thanksgiving in an old-fashioned way. I invited everyone in my neighborhood to my house, we had an enormous feast, and then I killed them and took their land. || More than 150 heads of state attended the UN Summit, giving New Yorkers a chance to get in touch with prejudices they didn't even know they had. || I'm not just a boy toy. I have feelings and dreams like anybody else. || You just have to keep trying to do good work, and hope that it leads to more good work. I want to look back on my career and be proud of the work, and be proud that I tried everything. Yes, I want to look back and know that I was terrible at a variety of things. || The first time I got to second base, I was driving and my friend was in the backseat getting tit. I considered that scoring - the rearview mirror was just a technicality. I didn't have sex until college - and even then, it's not like the floodgates opened. When I finally had a girlfriend, she ended up scoring with the goalie of the lacrosse team, so that didn't work out. || The Supreme Court ruled that disabled golfer Casey Martin has a legal right to ride in a golf cart between shots at PGA Tour events. Man, the next thing you know, they're going to have some guy carry his clubs around for him. || So, is there hope for a truly democratic Africa? Long answer: Only if continent-wide improvements in education, human rights and public health are coupled with an aggressive and far-sighted debt-relief program that breaks the cycle of subsistence farming and urban squalor. Short answer: No. || I have some bad news. Bjork cannot be here tonight. She was trying on her Oscar dress and Dick Cheney shot her. || Democrats do have an historic race going. Hillary Clinton vs. Barack Obama. Normally, when you see a black man or a woman president an asteroid is about to hit the Statue of Liberty. || The best-laid plans of mice and comedians usually wind up on the cutting-room floor. || On an average day 7 minutes of news happens. Yet there are currently three full-time, 24-hour news networks. || That's the beauty of our show. Comedy or politics. We're sort of a mix. A space age polymer of both. A synthetic comedy-like material. || The night I turned twenty-two, I drank a shot for every year. I was so drunk, I'd just walk up to people in the bar and hit them in the balls. My friends drove me home and left me propped up on the couch holding a bucket. I woke up with vomit all over me. The bucket was clean as a whistle. || They create these rules and argue about things we don't even understand. It is like watching soccer. You sit there and you're sort of amused, but most of the time you're thinking, ""pick up the ball!"" That's what you're thinking. || Body hair. You know when you're swimming as a kid and you want to crawl on your dad? None of us went anywhere near him. 'My god, a beaver! Everyone out of the pool!' || In 1982 I was playing soccer at William and Mary, and a kid from Randolph-Macon called me a kike. I ran after him. 'I'm not a... well, yes I am.' || Liberal and conservative have lost their meaning in America. I represent the distracted center. || It's not that the Democrats are playing checkers and the Republicans are playing chess. It's that the Republicans are playing chess and the Democrats are in the nurse's office because once again they glued their balls to their thighs. || I am a tiny, neurotic man, standing in the back of the room throwing tomatoes at the chalk board. And that's really it. And what we do is we come in in the morning and we go, ""Did you see that thing last night? Aahh!"" And then we spend the next 8 or 9 hours trying to take this and make it into something funny. || I always knew I shouldn't have said that. || No. I'm not going to be your monkey. || On a personal note, I'm a comedian who makes fun of what I believe to be the absurdities of our government. Make my life difficult. Make this next four years really shitty for me, so that every morning all we can do is come in and go, 'Madonna is doing some Kaballah thing, you wanna do that?' I'd like that. I'm tired. || I've always run by the hierarchy of ""If not funny, interesting. If not interesting, hot. If not hot, bizarre. If not bizarre, break something."" || I don't have a sort of Amway-esque chart up on my refrigerator or anything. || Get there early because hope does not park your mother-fucking car. || The only time a politico will try to avoid playing the blame game is when they or theirs are to blame. || Here’s how bizarre the war is that we’re in in Iraq, and we should have known this right from the get-go: When we first went into Iraq, Germany didn’t want to go. Germany. The Michael Jordan of war took a pass. || Religion is far more of a choice than homosexuality. || GOP strategists hope the revelation of Kerry's wealth might debunk his status as a, quote, man of the people, and reveal him to be a bit of a fat cat. Unlike the President who as we all know before attending Andover and Yale, was a Cockney matchstick girl dying of tuberculosis. || Historic in a good sense, not historic in a sense of 'so we dropped bombs on everyone.' || The nation of Dubai banned the movie Charlie's Angles because it's offensive to the religion of Islam. Apparently, the religion of Islam is offended by anything without a plot. || Does anyone know... does the Christian persecution complex have an expiration date? Because... uh... you've all been in charge pretty much since... uh... what was that guys name... Constantine. He converted in, what was it, 312 A.D. I'm just saying, enjoy your success. || I'm 38 and could very much bare my midriff, but it may make some people nauseous. || Despite his infirmities, Strom Thurmond showed up to work every day and did not miss a Senate vote in his final year, though no one is sure if a shouted ""Bingo!"" counted as a yea or a nay. || That's what it's like to be a comedian. You basically stand and stare at the world and hope it craps out cause that's a good year for you. So that's not a pleasant feeling. || Scores of Iraqi exiles met in London to discuss ways to overthrow Saddam Hussein in a grand gathering dubbed the 'Iraqi Military Alliance Meeting.' Of course, these people are no longer Iraqi, they have no military, and there is no alliance. But they did have a meeting. || Just every moment with Dick Cheney has been my favorite. Here's what I wonder about Dick Cheney, and the reason that maybe they keep him only in loyalty oath audiences, is if he becomes angry, I do believe he turns into the Hulk. And so, they try and keep people from questioning him, because he'll just - the shirt rips, and suddenly he has hair. So he's been my favorite, because he just goes out there to a room full of supporters and says, 'You know we're all going to die, right?' You're going to die unless I'm in charge.' || Julie Christie was absolutely amazing in Away From Her. Brilliant movie. It was the moving story of a woman who forgets her own husband. Hillary Clinton calls it the feel good movie of the year. || President Bush's approval ratings have taken somewhat of a dive. A senior slump, if you will. Leading President Bush to one conclusion: He is the only one who realizes what a great job he's being doing. || The Oscars is really I guess the one night of the year when you can see all your favorite stars without having to donate any money to the Democratic Party. And it's exciting for the stars as well because it's the first time many of you have ever voted for a winner. || You know if I had nickel for every time Bush has mentioned 9/11, I could raise enough reward money to go after Bin Laden. || Even if the flag burning amendment does become law, the larger problem will remain of how to respectfully dispose of older, tattered flags. Well, fortunately the U.S. official Flag Code has a suggestion about this. Quote: 'The flag, when it is in such a condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem of display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.' Owwwwcchh. In response, the House Republicans are calling for tattered flags to be kept alive via a feeding tube. || If you're keeping score at home, so far our war in Iraq has created a police state in that country and socialism in Spain. So, no democracies yet, but we're really getting close. || When did our elections become the Special Olympics? You're not all winners. Not everyone gets a hug. You guys got crushed. || Give me back the $800 billion for the Iraq war and children’s television PBS is on the house. || Originally we were going to title it The Daily Show With Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays Off, but it was too long. || Oscar is 80 this year, which makes him now automatically the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. || Yes! Finally captured Martha Stewart. You know, with all the massive and almost completely unpunished fraud perpetrated on the American public by such companies as Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco and Adelphia, we finally got the ringleader. Maybe now we can lower the nation's terror alert to periwinkle. || I don't know why people think that somehow the First Amendment applies to network television. It doesn't. It's like the way free speech doesn't apply at work. You can't just walk into your boss' office and say 'you're a fuckface and I'm gonna go back to work now.' No, you're not. || People would like to place a standard on our show that doesn't exist. We're not set up for reporting; we don't have an apparatus for that. We're discussing things that hopefully people might get something out of, but it's wildly inconsistent. Just because we hit on points that resonate, or people think are real complaints - that doesn't make us journalists. || To have not shot his friend in the face would have sent a message to the quail that America is weak. || Most world religions denounced war as a barbaric waste of human life. We treasured the teachings of these religions so dearly that we frequently had to wage war in order to impose them on other people. || If everything is amplified, we hear nothing. || Donald Rumsfeld. Love him or hate him, you've gotta admit: a lot of people hate him. || Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I figured this out. I know what's wrong with what we've done in Iraq. We've been following time as it goes forward. What a classic mistake. Linear time is so pre-9-11. || Why would these English explorers search for these spices, yet never use them in their food? || As our larynxes descended, we were able to make sounds with our mouths in new and far more expressive ways. Verbal language soon overtook physical gesturing as the primary means of communication for all human beings except Italians. || In fourteen hundred ninety-two Columbus sailed the ocean blue and discovered America. Now, some have argued Columbus actually discovered the West Indies, or that Norsemen had discovered America centuries earlier, or that you really can't get credit for discovering a land already populated by indigenous people with a developed civilization. Those people are communists. Columbus discovered America. || What are you so mad about? That we still have a government? We still have “traffic lights.” We’re sorry. The government’s not perfect, but some people wish it was better, not gone. || What would Jesus, or any human being who isn't an asshole, do? || If I was to really get at the burr in my saddle, it’s not politics - and this is, I think, probably a horrible analogy - but I look at politicians as, they are doing what inherently they need to do to retain power. Their job is to consolidate power. When you go to the zoo and you see a monkey throwing poop, you go, ‘That’s what monkeys do, what are you gonna do?’ But what I wish the media would do more frequently is say, 'Bad monkey.' || I thinking gay and straight people use the same putters, it's not a matter of putters but a matter of hole selection. || As an adolescent, Vonnegut made my life bearable. || Bush proposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Some saw the move as an attempt to preserve traditional values, while others saw it as a cynical ploy to ensure that Vice President... Cheney will never have to pay for his gay daughter's wedding. || And then you've got Lieberman, who is for the war. And thinks the tax cuts could really help. He's basically for people who want to vote for Bush but don't think Bush is Jewish enough. || I think of myself as a comedian who has the pleasure of writing jokes about things that I actually care about. And that's really it. You know, if I really wanted to enact social change I have great respect for people who are in the front lines and the trenches of trying to enact social change. I am far lazier than that. || We'd always sworn, we're taking 60 Minutes down. You, Frontline, all you guys. You're meat. || We don't consider ourselves equal opportunity anythings, because that's not - you know, that's the beauty of fake journalism. We don't have to - we travel in fake ethics. || I've been to Canada, and I've always gotten the impression that I could take the country over in about two days. || Thomas Jefferson once said: 'Of course the people don't want war. But the people can be brought to the bidding of their leader. All you have to do is tell them they're being attacked and denounce the pacifists for somehow a lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.' I think that was Jefferson. Oh wait. That was Hermann Goering. Shoot. || Fatherhood is great because you can ruin someone from scratch. || You know what they say: If at first you don't succeed, fuck it. || I was born in New York City, but I was raised in New Jersey, part of the great Jewish emigration of 1963. || 61% of graduating teens have had sex, 37% will eventually have sex, and 2% become statisticians. || In case you're wondering what we all do here during the commercial breaks, mostly we just sit around making catty remarks about the outfits you're all wearing at home. || Like everyone else, I want to sleep with Leonardo DiCaprio. || He's not stupid ... he's not a retarded man ... he just doesn't give a shit about you, or anything. || I thought those two guys really vibed on each other. They seem to have a very respectful relationship. It felt really sincere. ""I respect you, you respect me."" And I'm not usually a big fan of sincerity. || It's lunch time in the Diamond District. All the stores close down and the street is filled with chasidim, who suddenly find themselves caught in Yidlock. || The value of holding a grudge. And to always refer to my father sarcastically as Mr. Wonderful. || I mean, I'm not hoping for the apes and the monolith. I'm hoping for controlled chaos to assist us. || Insomnia is my greatest inspiration. || Jews and Blacks come from the same history - 2,000 years of bullshit. We just expressed our suffering differently as people. Blacks developed the blues. Jews complain, we just never thought of putting it to music. || Every generation has their challenge. And things change rapidly, and life gets better in an instant. || Everybody talks about the entitlement generation. There is no time I would rather live in than now… There’s a tendency to live in a nostalgic state in this country, and think that other generations possessed an integrity and a tenacity better than the generation that is now. I wholeheartedly disagree with that, and I believe this is a group that will rise up to any challenge that comes before them, as well as any other generation in America would have done. My advice to them would be to please don’t think of me as an entitled moocher when I’m collecting my government benefits. || They always throw around this term 'the liberal elite.' And I kept thinking to myself about the Christian right. What's more elite than believing that only you will go to heaven? || To me, that's where a lot of satire lies. News used to hold itself to a higher plane and slowly it has dissolved into, well, me. || You know, I've always wanted to be a young Charles Kuralt. I started in this business with just a Winnebago and a dream. || Some are from the world of the arts, some from the fields of business, architecture, wine-making and education. What they have in common is that they are all known nationally - and many internationally - for their wide-ranging achievements. || New York became the first state to ban talking on hand-held cell phones while driving. First-time violators could receive a fine of $100, with an additional mandatory six-month jail sentence if your ringer plays a Latin-themed novelty song. || Critics noted Schwarzenegger's only previous government experience was serving as chairman of the Council of Physical Fitness, where his only responsibility was doing hundreds of jumping jacks he was doing anyway. || Capote, of course, addressed very similar themes to Good Night and Good Luck. Both films are about determined journalists defying obstacles in a relentless pursuit of the truth. Needless to say, both are period pieces. || Gay people can't be proud of the country and want to defend it too. What's the army afraid is going to happen if gay people are in it. ""Private, shoot that man!"" ""I can't, he's adorable."" || I don't want to die before my parents die, especially my mother. Because I think that's tragic. Because I don't want her to get the chance to pick out what I'm going to wear for eternity. || Hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill. In some respects, the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most - you know, the difference between potential and kinetic energy? - they have the most potential energy, so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion, the most interest. I don't mean for the audience. I mean for us. Everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we don't care about. || I think people are used to people in show business having a lot of hubris. I think I have a normal amount of self-loathing but because I'm in show business it's considered self-deprecation. In normal life I would just be considered your average neurotic. || Here's the point - you're looking at affirmative action, and you're looking at marijuana. You legalize marijuana, no need for quotas, because really, who's gonna wanna work? || We came, we saw, we sucked. || Most Americans don't live their lives solely as Democrats or Republicans or conservatives or liberals. Most Americans live their lives that our just a little bit late for something they have to do. Often it’s something they do not want to do, but they do it. Impossible things get done every day that are only made possible by the little, reasonable compromises. || If someone was to introduce hope and idealism into our political system, I think the tension that would create in other areas would certainly be ripe. You would think that if you bring oxygen to the organism, the organism lives. But there may be other organisms in there that thrive in darkness and in a more anaerobic environment. Watching those creatures writhe will always be interesting. || I just wanted to tell you why I grieve - but why I don’t despair. || We hear every damn day about how fragile our country is - on the brink of catastrophe - torn by polarizing hate, and how it’s a shame that we can’t work together to get things done, but the truth is we do. We work together to get things done every damn day! || The bias of the mainstream media is toward sensationalism, conflict, and laziness. || If you don't stick to your values when they're being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. || But we are at war, and we here at The Daily Show will do our best to keep you informed of any late-breaking... humor we can find. Of course, our show is obviously at a disadvantage compared to the many news sources that we're competing with… at a disadvantage in several respects. For one thing, we are fake. They are not. So in terms of credibility we are, well, oddly enough, actually about even. We're about even. || Ahh, Earth Day, the only day of the year where being able to hacky-sack will get you laid. || I heard Dennis Kucinich say in a debate, 'When I'm president...' and I just wanted to stop him and say, 'Dude.' || Yes, reason has been a part of organized religion, ever since two nudists took dietary advice from a talking snake. || The Westboro Baptist Church is no more a church than Church's Fried Chicken is a church. || The more you delve into science, the more it appears to rely on faith. || Religion. It's given people hope in a world torn apart by religion. || Sarcasm - I get it now! See at the time I thought your jokey manner was just the way you were sublimating your shame over the discomfort you feel deep in your soul after extinguishing the last smoldering embers of any of your program’s journalistic bonafides! || If I'd only followed CNBC's advice, I'd have a million dollars today. Provided I'd started with a hundred million dollars. || Being a superpower is like being a Santa Claus that everyone hates. || No one is better at not beating America than England. || I feel your scorn, and I accept it. || Happy Valentine's Day! And if this is news to you, my guess is you're probably alone. Valentine's Day is often times a, well, it's a manufactured day that really doesn't mean anything. || I can't sing. Never been able to sing. I can't do voices very well. Every impression I do sounds the same. I can't dunk. Man, would I give anything to dunk. Just once. || Don't cross Lorenzo Lamas. Ever. || Last week North Korea publicly admitted for the first time it has nuclear weapons. The Bush administration has so far shown very little concern, as the North Korean missiles are believed only capable of reaching the Blue States. || Maybe we should always show pictures. Bin Laden, pictures of our wounded service people, pictures of maimed innocent civilians. We can only make decisions about war if we see what war actually is - and not as a video game where bodies quickly disappear leaving behind a shiny gold coin. || The Jews celebrate Passover by eating unpalatable food to remind them what will happen to their people if they ever leave New York City. The traditional meal often includes gefilte fish. For those of you who don't know what gefilte fish is, it strongly resembles a ball of tuna fish that has been passed nasally. It's not good. During Passover, the angel of death passed over the Jews - an event that, up until the late 1950s, was re-enacted every year by Ivy League colleges and suburban country clubs. || A free and independent press is essential to the health of a functioning democracy. It serves to inform the voting public on matters relevant to its well-being. Why they've stopped doing that is a mystery. I mean, 300 camera crews outside a courthouse to see what Kobe Bryant is wearing when the judge sets his hearing date, while false information used to send our country to war goes unchecked? What the fuck happened? || It upset me that, five days after the hurricane hit down in New Orleans, the President's plan was for a day of prayer. I would have thought a truck of food. A day of prayer. Now, maybe I'm mistaken here and, again, I'm not a scientific expert, but isn't a hurricane officially an act of God? Isn't a day of prayer kind of redundant? Hasn't God already made up his mind on that sort of thing? So we do a day of prayer. The President has his stupid day of prayer. Three days later, Hurricane Rita hits. Somebody must have said something... something like, ""is that all you got?"" || You wonder sometimes how our government puts on its pants in the morning. || Honest or not, in what world is a 35:1 leveraged position sane? || As long as I don't end up hosting a skin care commercial with Cher, I'm happy. || If Obama's a tyrant, he's a pretty tame tyrant. How many tyrants do you know that really suffer because they can't get cloture? || The country’s 24 hour political pundit perpetual panic conflictinator did not cause our problems but its existence makes solving them that much harder. The press can hold its magnifying up to our problems bringing them into focus, illuminating issues heretofore unseen or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected dangerous flaming ant epidemic. If we amplify everything we hear nothing. || We grew up in the good old days before kids had these damn computers and actually played outside. || If the events of September 11, 2001, have proven anything, it's that the terrorists can attack us, but they can't take away what makes us American - our freedom, our liberty, our civil rights. No, only Attorney General John Ashcroft can do that. || Why did the Articles of Confederation fail so completely? Most historians believe the founding fathers spent a great deal of their first constitutional convention drafting the delaration of independence and only realized on July 3rd the Articles were also due. || I reject the idea there are just two sides. I think that with the amount of ideas and thoughts there are, it’s not even going to be consistent with the same person. People can hold liberal and conservative dogma points at the same time. They’re not living their lives via platforms. They’re living their lives. The whole thing is an awfully tired construct. || To the people who are upset about their hard-earned tax money going to things they don’t like: welcome to the fucking club. Reimburse me for the Iraq war and oil subsidies, and diaphragms are on me! || The press can hold its magnifying glass up to our problems and illuminate problems heretofore unseen, or it can use its magnifying glass to light ants on fire, and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected dangerous-flaming-ant epidemic. If we amplify everything, we hear nothing. || If you try to hit a grand slam, you’re going to strike out. || Reform Jews are the children of Conservative Jews, or as they are sometimes known, Christians with curlier hair. || Many of our soldiers are stationed at Camp Coyote just south of the Iraqi border. This is how you know we have a strong army, when you can actually tell your enemy exactly where your camp is and what its name is. || Look, we're both snake oil salesman to a certain extent, but we do label the show as snake oil here. Isn't there a problem selling snake oil as vitamin tonic? || I remember having a grade-school teacher I thought was a hard-ass. When you're that age, you think the guy is Himmler. Then you visit him eight years later and he's wearing polyester pants, he's four foot eight, you think he's gay, and you're like, 'Are you the guy I was afraid of?' || My life was typical. I played a little Little League baseball. I never wanted for food. I always had shoes. I had a room. There were no great tragedies. There were the typical ups and downs but I wouldn' t say it was at all sad. We were Jewish and living in the suburbs so there was a slightly neurotic bent to it, but I can't point to anything where a boy overcame a tragedy to become a comedian. As my grandmother used to say, 'I can't complain.' || By the way, when you finish the bottle of Crown Royal, you can still use the pouch to hold your broken dreams. || Pigmentation was a quick and convenient way of judging a person. One of us, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once proposed we instead judge people by the content of their character. He was shot. || We called her Mother Earth. Because she gave birth to us, and then we sucked her dry. || We must, together as a nation, stop watching Fox. || When did fact checking and journalism go their separate ways? || That is amazing! I mean these CEOs saying their own businesses are doing OK! I mean, it makes sense to take these CEOs word for it. For instance, I know O.J. Simpson. He told me he didn't kill anyone and he should know, he was there! || You can use your idealism to further your aims, if you realize that nothing is Nirvana, nothing is perfect. || The problem with the Tea Party is they're all ignorant hillbillies who drink moonshine and ride around on mules. And they believe in stereotypes too. || We declared war on terror - it's not even a noun, so, good luck. After we defeat it, I'm sure we'll take on that bastard ennui. || The reason I don’t worry about society is, nineteen people knocked down two buildings and killed thousands. Hundreds of people ran into those buildings to save them. I’ll take those odds every fucking day. || I have complete faith in the continued absurdity of whatever’s going on. || I visit Fox News every now and again, and it’s nice, because the Eye of Mordor is above the building. || Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit adultery. Don't eat pork. I'm sorry, what was that last one?? Don't eat pork. God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to outsmart everybody? || It's great having Bruce Springsteen on my show. We have so much in common! We're both from New Jersey, just from different neighborhoods. Sort of like how Martin Luther King and Margaret Mitchell both came from Atlanta. But from different neighborhoods. || Alright guys, I want to get out there and vote tomorrow. And not because it's cool, because it's not. You know what is cool? Smoking. Smoke while you vote. || He had a passion and a depth of belief, and an optimism, and a tenacity that I very much admired. He was one of the first people I remember learning about, and maybe his death left an indelible mark. I felt that Robert Kennedy was a man of political integrity. || We all know what happens to celebrities when their time is up - rehab and then a stint on VH1. || We are not warriors in anyone's army. And that is not trying to be self-deprecating. I'm proud of what we do. I really like these two shows. I like making 'em. I like watching them. I'm really proud of them. But I understand their place. I don't view us as people who lead social movements. || And try as I might, I am having difficulty giving a fuck. || For me it was just exciting to see fake news catching on like that. We don't you know, it's interesting. I think we don't make things up. We just distill it to, hopefully, its most humorous nugget. And in that sense it seems faked and skewed just because we don't have to be subjective or pretend to be objective. We can just put it out there. || Everybody thought Barack Obama was going to inspire people when he came to Washington, but, you know, the Senate seems like the place where smart people go to die. || Here's the way I look at it. President Bush has uranium-tipped bunker busters and I have puns. I think he'll be OK. || Why can't they have gay people in the army? Personally, I think they are just afraid of a thousand guys with M16s going, ""Who'd you call a faggot?"" || Orthodox Jews, or, as they are known in the Talmud, the Really Chosen Ones, are committed to the idea that the entire Torah was dictated by God verbatim to Moses at Mount Sinai... Other forms of Judaism dispute this claim, although it does explain certain passages in the first Torah, such as, ""I'm sorry, am I boring you?"" and ""What do you like better, Moses, Lord Almighty or Big Hoohah?"" || What you do for Jewish New Year is you go down to Times Square... It's a lot quieter than the regular New Year. It's just a few Jews walking around going, ""'sup?"" || I think the metric by which television is considered liberal is literally based on the metric of liberalism in each person's soul. Peoples' senses of humor tend to go about as far as their ideology. || Terrorists are planning to disrupt our democratic process. It's scary I know, but we're not going to let al Qaeda tell us what to do. In fact, our government has decided that if al Qaeda attempts to disrupt our democratic process, we are going to respond by disrupting it first."
Jonathan Winters,"Now the freaks are on television, the freaks are in the movies. And it's no longer the sideshow, it's the whole show. The colorful circus and the clowns and the elephants, for all intents and purposes, are gone, and we're dealing only with the freaks. || I was talking to a businessman, and I said, ""Don't you think most men are little boys?"" And he said, ""I'm no little boy! I make seventy-five thousand dollars a year."" And I said, ""Well, the way I look at it - you just have bigger toys."" || When you wear so many hats in society, you never know who you are. That's the beauty of it. Because once you find out who you are, you're screwed. || Nothing is impossible. Some things are just less likely than others. || I couldn't wait for success, so I went ahead without it. || If your ship doesn't come in, swim out to meet it. || Throughout my life, I've been gratified that I've been able to keep the child in me alive and inspire others. || If God had really intended man to fly, He’d make it easier to get to the airport. || God is in my head, but the devil is in my pants."
Kevin James,"I went water skiing and I found out that I scream the exact same if a great white attacks me... or if a piece of seaweed touches my foot. || I'm not a gay man, but I will say this: I get it now. I know what all the hype is about. || How big are muffins going to get before we all join hands across America? Have you seen them? They're huge. ""Yeah, I'll take a coffee and... Oh, my God! Yeah, I'll have the beanbag chair with raisins."" || Thanksgiving, man. Not a good day to be my pants. || Love the questions at the airport because they make you feel real intelligent. ""Sir, do you know what's in your luggage?"" ""No. I tied a sock around my eyes and packed with my feet. I'm thinking hot dogs and gunpowder."" || For some reason and I don't know why, but I don't think that I'm funny in California. So I always want to do my movies east somewhere. || Let go of the damn door! Sit your ass on the kerb, I will come around and let ya in! || Back in '93 I saw my first UFC fight and just became enamored by it then. || This annoyed me: I was on the phone with somebody today trying to get a phone number from that person and write it down, but they didn't have phone number rhythm and that pissed me off. You know what I'm talking about? Phone number rhythm. Especially if there's like an area code involved, like 'two one two - bum bum buh - bum buh bum buh!' That is the rhythm I think we're all familiar with. This guy had no clue! I was like ""Okay, Hank. Gimme the number."" He's like ""Alright. It's two one two nine - fifteen eight eleven six fou... tw... five... eight... seven... two."" ""Did you throw in your zip code? Cause I got a lot of extra numbers over here. I have extra. I can almost start a new number! What do ya got?! Start again from the top!"" They really screw you up on the last four numbers. That's where they get ya. ""Five five five - six... teen forty one"" ""Dude, I already wrote the six! I made the dash too close, I can't shimmy the one in there now! Forget you!"" || It was fun because, after shooting, Will and I would eat a jar of pickles and tell each other secrets. It was so much fun! || I did stand-up my whole career, and Vince didn't, and it's a little frustrating when he's funnier than me, and that bothers me a little bit. || How about we work out a plan at my apartment and dinner should be around. So we can just do both. || Why do you always give me jobs you know I'm going to fail at? || It's always cool to meet people who can do things that you have no capacity to do. || If I do a movie where I have to have a son and it's a chubby kid, my mother is always like, 'You were never like that.' She gets so upset about it. || I've always had something in my heart where I root for guys who struggle with women. || I would always love to be an athlete, but it's got to be a tough day when you have to hang up those cleats. || I want to do movies that I'm proud of where my kids, at some point, can see and I can feel comfortable sitting there watching it with them. And just that move people. That make people feel a little bit better about themselves when they leave the theatre. || I try to connect with the everyday, every guy. || Teachers have a chance to mold someone, inspire them. I hope all teachers realize that. || I don't want to be known as this goody-two-shoes who can only do comedies where puppies are licking peanut butter off my face. || I've always been the guy who doesn't necessarily get it with women. A woman would have to say, 'I like you, I want to go out with you, you can ask me.' And still I would question it. Did she mean it? || I took a public speaking class in college and managed to make the class laugh a little bit. || I could never be James Bond. || The mind is the only weapon that doesn't need a holister. || Every time I do a movie where it gets physical, I say never again. || Every few months I'll pop into a comedy club or go to Vegas. || A song can take you to a special time in your life. || From there, I tried out for a community theatre play, joined an improv group... it all started opening up. || There's no better feeling in the world than a warm pizza box on your lap. || I just want to put some positive stuff out there. If it works, great. If it doesn't, no problem. || My fitness goals are different than most peoples. Most people want to lose enough weight so they look good in a bathing suit or they want to lower their cholesterol. I just want to lose enough so my stomach doesn't jiggle when I brush my teeth. || I never played a musical instrument growing up but I knew kids who did and took it very seriously. || Now I'm starting to jog. But every time I do jog I have 9-1 pressed into my phone, with the next '1' ready to be launched in case I drop. || You know, when you're a fat guy you don't need a reason to sweat. Guys come up to me and go ""Jeez... what have you been doing - jumping rope in the attic or something?"" ""Umm, no... I peeled an orange about an hour ago, why?"" || I never played music, but it's an important thing... the studying, the inspiration. || I think I invented the phrase 'Don't overdo it.' || My favorite movie of all time is 'Rocky.' || As American as an apple is and as American as baseball is, they don't go together. You can't be chewing an apple at a baseball game. You've got to let go of the diet that day. || Once a year my back will go out and it'll be... it's like a sciatic thing and it's the smallest thing. Like I could be leaning over the sink to brush my teeth in a weird way and it happens. || I know De Niro, you know, it's all famous that he packed on 60 pounds for Raging Bull, but ah, he just did it for one movie, I do that for every movie. || Just me onstage with a mike having an intimate relationship with the audience. I don't get nervous for that. I just get excited. || I'm not a Hollywood guy. || I had my boy in Boston on Easter Sunday. That kills me, from a sports perspective. He's a Boston baby and I'm a New York guy. || I had many teachers that were great, positive role models and taught me to be a good person and stand up and be a good man. A lot of the principals they taught me still affect how I act sometimes and it's 30 years later. || You think school ends when it ends, but it doesn't. || There, there's your skin-flap. That piece that looks like my ass caught fire and somebody put it out with an old t-shirt is yours."
Kevin Pollak,"I am completely and utterly hooked to all the great shows on A&E and Court TV that are about small town murder. These shows like ""Forensic Files"", ""City Confidential"", I just can't get enough of them. It's always the same sort of deal. You know that they interview the actual people that lived through the experience. I miss Paul Winfield as the host of ""City Confidential"", may he rest in peace. || The law against sodomy is trying to stop homosexual men from enjoying themselves. That's what the law is all about. But this is stupid. What do you do according to the law? You find two men enjoying themselves sexually. You arrest them and throw them in... prison? That outta do it. || Peter Hyams - and these are his words, it sounds a little self-serving, sharing them from me - his suggestion was that Gabriel and I could lend a credibility, acting-wise, to an otherwise big, sloppy studio action film. || No one smokes because they like the way it tastes. If we did, they'd make cigarette-flavored cookies, candy, ice cream. ""What is this? Marlboro fudge with nuts? Give me a scoop of that, willya? She's gonna have the Menthol Swirl with the Camel chip."" || As rewarding as a good film role can be, there is just nothing like getting up on a stage and taking an audience for a ride. You make a movie, and the audience may not see it for another 10 months. Here, you know immediately their reaction. || If we do have any iPhone users out there, I have incredibly great news for you. I've developed after about six months and finally perfected and it'll be out on the market soon, an app that you'll all want. It allows you to make a phone call."
Larry Miller,"As women well know, the reason men are no good at playing dumb is most of the time we're not playing. || I don't want a clean living guy in the White House with his finger on the button. He thinks he's going right to heaven. You want to feel safe with a leader. Give me a guy who fights in bars and cheats on his wife. This is a man who wants to put off Judgment Day as long as possible. || Manufacturers are making products kosher to get in on that market, plus more people are looking for kosher. || Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to get old is when we're kids? If you're less than ten years old, you're so excited about aging that you think in fractions. ""How old are you?"" ""I'm four and a half."" You get into your teens; now they can't hold you back. You jump to the next number. ""How old are you?"" ""I'm gonna be 16."" Then the great day of your life; you become 21. Then you turn 30. What happened there? Makes you sound like bad milk. Then you're pushing 40. You reach 50; then you make it to 60. By then you've built up so much speed, you hit 70. After that, it's a day by day thing. You hit Wednesday... You get into your 80's; you hit lunch, you hit 4:30. My Grandmother won't even buy green bananas. ""Well, it's an investment, you know, and maybe a bad one."" Into the 90's, you start going backwards. ""I was just 92."" Then a strange thing happens; if you make it over 100, you become a little kid again. ""I'm 100 and a half."" || I've been a character actor, which I define as ""anyone in the movie who's not kissing Renee Zellweger. || Everything's nerve-wracking; you really shouldn't be in show business if you can't stand situations that are nerve-wracking, and you just have to learn to push that aside or rip it off and graft it onto your positive, creative energy. I mean, c'mon, I've been in 40, 50 movies and a bunch of TV shows. Someone asked a few months ago how many auditions I took, and I said, ""Boy, you got me. A lot, I guess. 700? 2,700? I don't know."" And then I started thinking and realized, ""Boy, I guess that's a lot."" You know what, either get some hard bark on you, or find another line. || It doesn't burn unless you take too long to blow it out. How true that is, for life in general. || I was asleep, in the upstairs bedroom, in the rear of the house. There was this tremendous crash, there was a terrible wind force hitting my body, and then I blanked out. || To women, we are like big dogs that talk. || Women say they have sexual thoughts too. They have no idea. It's the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. If they knew what we were really thinking, they'd never stop slapping us. || Every time a friend of mine has a kid I go over to the crib and say, ""You know, I used to hold your father’s head while he threw up."""
Lenny Bruce,"The only honest art form is laughter, comedy. You can't fake it... try to fake three laughs in an hour - ha ha ha ha ha - they'll take you away, man. You can't. || I credit the motion picture industry as the strongest environmental factor in molding the children of my day. || Guys are like dogs. They keep coming back. Ladies are like cats. Yell at a cat one time... they're gone. || Miami Beach is where neon goes to die. || If you're going to stop masturbating, you can't ""taper off."" You've got to quit, cold jerky! || If you can't say ""Fuck"" you can't say, ""Fuck the government."" || The role of a comedian is to make the audience laugh, at a minimum of once every fifteen seconds. || When you're eight years old nothing is your business. || All my humor is based upon destruction and despair. If the whole world were tranquil, without disease and violence, I'd be standing on the breadline right in back of J. Edgar Hoover. || A lot of people say to me, 'Why did you kill Christ?' I dunno, it was one of those parties, got out of hand, you know. || I won't say ours was a tough school, but we had our own coroner. We used to write essays like: What I'm going to be if I grow up. || Never trust a preacher with more than two suits. || The thing with Catholicism, the same as all religions, is that it teaches what should be, which seems rather incorrect. This is ''what should be.'' Now, if you're taught to live up to a ''what should be'' that never existed - only an occult superstition, no proof of this ''should be'' - then you can sit on a jury and indict easily, you can cast the first stone, you can burn Adolf Eichmann, like that! || The only truly anonymous donor is the guy who knocks up your daughter. || That's where the conflict starts. We all want for a wife a combination Sunday school teacher and a $500-a-night hooker. || The ""what should be"" never did exist, but people keep trying to live up to it. There is no ""what should be,"" there is only what is. || If you live in New York, even if you're Catholic, you're Jewish. || Liberals will buy anything a bigot writes. In fact, they really support hate mongers. George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi Party is probably a very knowledgeable businessman with no political convictions what so ever. He gets three bucks a head and works the mass rallies consisting of nothing but angry Jews, shaking their fists and wondering why there are so many Jews there. And Rockwell probably has only two real followers - and they're deaf. They think the swastika is merely an Aztec symbol. || I hate small towns because once you've seen the cannon in the park there's nothing else to do. || Never tell. Not if you love your wife... In fact, if your old lady walks in on you, deny it. Yeah. Just flat out and she'll believe it: ""I'm tellin' ya. This chick came downstairs with a sign around her neck 'Lay on Top of Me Or I'll Die.' I didn't know what I was gonna do...."" || Satire is tragedy plus time. You give it enough time, the public, the reviewers will allow you to satirize it. Which is rather ridiculous, when you think about it. || ""Sex"" and ""obscenity"" are not synonymous. || You put a guy on a desert island, he'll do it to mud, a chicken, a barrel, anything, a knothole. || Today's comedian has a cross to bear that he built himself. A comedian of the older generation did an ''act'' and he told the audience, ''This is my act.'' Today's comic is not doing an act. The audience assumes he's telling the truth. What is truth today may be a damn lie next week. || There are never enough I Love You's. || I've been accused of bad taste, and I'll go down to my grave accused of it and always by the same people, the ones who eat in restaurants that reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. || The whole motivation for any performer is ""Look at me, Ma"". || If you can take the hot lead enema, then you can cast the first stone. || Now a Jew, in the dictionary, is one who is descended from the ancient tribes of Judea, or one who is regarded as descended from that tribe. That's what it says in the dictionary; but you and I know what a Jew is - One Who Killed Our Lord. And although there should be a statute of limitations for that crime, it seems that those who neither have the actions nor the gait of Christians, pagan or not, will bust us out, unrelenting dues, for another deuce. || It's the suppression of the word that gives it the power, the violence, the viciousness. || I'm not a comedian. I'm Lenny Bruce. || I sort of felt sorry for the damned flies. They never hurt anybody. Even though they were supposed to carry diseases I never heard of anybody saying they caught something form a fly. My cousin gave two guys the clap and nobody ever whacked her with a paper. || Four years working in clubs - that's what really made it for me - every night: doing it, doing it, doing it, getting bored and doing different ways, no pressure on you, and all the other comedians are drunken bums who don't show up, so I could try anything. || Let me tell you the truth. The truth is what is, and what should be is a fantasy. A terrible, terrible lie that someone gave to the people long ago. || If Jesus had been killed twenty years ago, Catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses. || What is dirty? And what is clean? Now, if I had to make a choice, man, I would rather my kid watch a stag movie than a clean movie like King of Kings. Why? Because King of Kings is full of killing and I don't want my kid to kill Christ when he comes back. || Every day people are straying away from the church and going back to God. || Children ought to watch pornographic movies: it's healthier than learning about sex from Hollywood. || I am influenced by every second of my waking hour. || There is only what is and that's it. What should be is a dirty lie. || If I get busted in New York, the freest city in the world, that will be the end of my career. || I want to perform an unnatural act. || I'll die young, but it's like kissing God. || Communism is like one big phone company. || If a titty is pretty, it's dirty but not if it's bloody and maimed. || Marijuana will be legal someday, because the many law students who now smoke pot will one day be Congressmen and they will legalize it to protect themselves. I don't smoke pot, and I'm glad because then I can champion it without any special pleading. The reason I don't smoke pot is because it facilitates ideas and heightens sensations - and I got enough shit flying through my head without smoking pot. || The liberals can understand everything but people who don't understand them. || In the Halls of Justice the only justice is in the halls. || If you believe there is a God, a God that made your body, and yet you think that you can do anything with that body that's dirty, then the fault lies with the manufacturer. || Life is a four-letter word. || You know there's no crooked politicians. There's never a lie because there is never any truth."
Lewis Black,"I don't know if you realize, but I use the word ""Fuck,"" so that I can think of other stuff. || Normally, in February, in Boston and in most of the country, the weather is gray, rainy, gray, sleet, gray, rain, gray, sleet, snow, gray; every day it just gets grayer and grayer and grayer! You wake up one day, and you go, 'I'm not comin' into work today!' Your boss goes, 'Why not? You sick?' 'No! It's too gray!' || Homeland security is a problem... Because, it's a good idea, but it's a problem, because the man who runs it is Tom Ridge. And he is someone who has the leadership qualities of... a gerbil. He was a part of coming up with what is the color coding system of security. You know, orange and yellow, and whatever the fuck the others are. OK? And what's stupid about it is they had it color-coded, like we're in fucking elementary school! There's no need for that! Because every time they tell us what the color is, then they have to fucking explain it, so get rid of the fucking color! Simplify it; there should be three levels of security: Jesus Christ, Goddammit, fuck me!  || This is Grand Theft Auto 3. The object of this game, who cares? I'm too busy randomly hitting an old lady with a bat, carjacking a station wagon and running over people, or, my personal favorite, running over the person whose car I just stole, with the car I just stole! Now, this is a video game! Rescuing the princess is for pussies! || I will tell you, that you Christians have created a holiday that has become a beast that cannot be fed. Every year, Christmas gets longer and longer and longer, and you don't care, do you? You just take more and more of the calendar for yourself. It's unbelievable. How long does it take you people to shop?! It's beyond belief. It's insane. When I was a kid, Halloween was Halloween, and Santa wasn't poking his ass into it! || The people who told us about sun block were the same people who told us, when I was a kid, that eggs were good. So I ate a lot of eggs. Ten years later they said they were bad. I went, ""Well, I just ate the eggs!"" So I stopped eating eggs, and ten years later they said they were good again! Well, then I ate twice as many, and then they said they were bad. Well, now I'm really fucked! Then they said they're good, they're bad, they're good, the whites are good, th-the yellows - make up your mind! It's breakfast I've gotta eat! || I went to New Zealand this year, and, whew man, I know a lot of people want to go there. But let me just tell you, it's 22 hours by plane. So, if you have the opportunity, don't. || I knew it was way too cold this winter because I have not had one thought. I have not been able to complete a sentence in my own head. I find myself wondering, going; You know, I should really - fuck it's cold!  || The new millennium sucks! What a disappointment! What's the difference between the old millennium and the new millennium? Nothing! It's the same load of crap with a '2' in the front. When I was a kid, I am old enough so that when I was a kid, I looked forward to the new millennium. When I was young, I said, 'I'm gonna live through a change! A massive change! Things are gonna be different! Things are gonna be great!' Screwed again! No flying cars! No flying cars! || If the people of New Zealand want to be part of our world, I believe they should hop off their islands, and push 'em closer. || And then the other CEOs would gather and they'd go, ""Who's that?"" ""Who's that? That, my friends, is my very esteemed personal ball washer. What did you guys buy? Another car? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"" || In four days, I experienced five seasons. It was thirty, it was sixty, it was ninety, then it was twelve! And on the last day, there was thunder, lightning, and snow - together! And I hadn't done drugs. || When you compare Christmas to Hanukkah, there's no comparison. Christmas is great. Hanukkah sucks! First night you get socks. Second night, an eraser, a notebook. It's a Back-to-School holiday! || The best time to go to Vegas is during Christmastime, because nothing beats watching people gamble while they play Christmas carols. I'm Jewish, and I'm astonished. People going, ""Goddammit!"" ""Jesus Christ!"" ""Holy fuck!"" ""Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum, me and my drum."" || You know what they would do? They would come to my elementary school with films to show me how to protect myself from a nuclear-fuck-holocaust. They would show this giant nuclear-fucking-bomb just blowing the shit out of everything. Goats and monkeys flying everywhere. The windows of the elementary school blown out, the teacher banged up against the fucking blackboard. But there were the children... hiding safely under their desks. || It's absolutely stupid that we live without an ozone layer. We have men, we've got rockets, we've got saran wrap - fix it! || We exhaust ourselves worrying about our health. We're obsessed with it. We worry about our health and when we worry about our health, guess what? We're not fucking healthy! We're so worried about our health that we are now the fattest group of fucks on the planet Earth! ""Should I eat this or should I eat this? Well, I'll have to eat both!"" || Jesse Ventura is basically proof that the people of Minnesota are not social drinkers... they are obviously alcoholics. || The Catholics have it right. I love what they do. That whole ""the pope's infallible"" thing is tremendous. Let's face facts: If you took somebody with no religious leanings whatsoever and locked that person in a psych ward with nobody around and no stimuli, the Catholic church is exactly what he'd come up with. ""Listen to this. There's this old guy in a dress, see? He wears all these great costumes and wherever he says about anything from birth control to what to watch on television, that's it, 'cause pope knows best. He can't lift his head up, but, fuck, he's a genius."" || On the plane was a Time magazine and there was a 30 page article on diabetes, and I read every page. By the time that plane landed, I had diabetes. || I don't know if you've noticed, but our two-party system is a bowl of shit looking at itself in the mirror. || I get an idea about something. I just start thinking about it, and then I get onstage and I talk about it, and then I think about it some more and talk about it some more, and think about it some more and talk about it some more, until it starts to take a shape. || I don't need politicians doing a 24-hour prayer with Oral Roberts to get our country back on track. || I do the same gig. I might change it a little; I might slow it down if I'm in the South. I talk fast, and they're not used to people talking that fast. || I believe that summer is our time, a time for the people, and that no politician should be allowed to speak to us during the summer. They can start talking again after Labor Day. || Everybody's got cable. || Basically, I started on stage yelling and I kept yelling, and then I yelled some more, and then I yelled even louder. I'm modulated now. || You realize that for all the shenanigans that go on in the big circus of politics, everybody wakes up and goes to work. || I love anything that gets me outside of my own head. || If you are an adult, and you are planning to dress up on Halloween... don't. I will find you. I will hurt you. || Halftime at the Super Bowl is the best because halftime at the Super Bowl has gotten exponentially worse every year. I use the word 'exponentially' because I was taught it in math class and that was the first sentence I could use it in. 'Exponentially worse' means crappier and crappier and crappier. || FEMA I always thought was a bone here in your ass. || Can somebody explain to me why Pepsi and Coke advertise? Are we missing something? Seriously, everyone in this room has drank enough Pepsi and Coke in their lifetime they could piss it for a week. || I'd rather go ice fishing, which is the dumbest thing a man can do. You're sitting essentially in an out house and it's 30 below. You've cut a hole in the ice, and you're fishing for fish that you shouldn't eat, ‘cause any fish that is down there is fucking stupid. || Thanksgiving used to be Thanksgiving, and it was its own holiday, not Christmas: Part 1. When I was a kid, you ate, and you drank, and you passed out and nobody woke you up and said, 'Let's go shopping.' || If there is hell, it was modeled after junior high school. || Republicans have nothing but bad ideas and Democrats have no ideas. || There's no such thing as soy milk. It's soy juice. || Lactose intolerant milk? Kiss my dick! If you're lactose intolerant you can't drink milk. So what's in the fucking carton? Get it out of there, get it away from my milk. It is talking to my milk and making it feel bad about itself. || Is milk good or bad?... I rest my case. You don't know. You don't know anymore, and a lot of you are sitting there thinking ""Fuck, I'm an adult and I don't need to drink that shit anymore!"" || We always feel better in anticipation. You don't think about something and think ""Aw, it's gonna be shitty."" No! You say ""This is gonna be the greatest weekend ever! Sonuvabitch!"" And then, by Monday, you're throwing up and you're thinking ""You know, I always thought those guys were pricks!"" || The amazing thing is there are people who've never left this country who talk about the fact that we're the greatest country on Earth. How fucking dumb is that?! Cuz you don't know, if you haven't left here you don't know. There are countries that may be giving shit away every day! Canada's one of those countries. You know what they give away? Health insurance! || There is no better moment than this moment, when we're anticipating the actual moment itself. All of the moments that lead up to the actual moment are truly the best moments. Those are the moments that are filled with good times. Those are the moments in which you are able to think that it is going to be perfect, when the moment actually happens. But, the moment is reality, and reality always kinda sucks! || I started playing golf when I was a kid, because across the street from where we lived there was a little nine-hole golf course where my father worked. || If you're working out in front of a mirror and watching your muscles grow, your ego has reached a point where it is now eating itself. That's why I believe there should be a psychiatrist at every health club, so that when they see you doing this, they will take you away for a little chat. || It The Weather Channel is the most watched cable channel in America. I'll repeat that. It is the most watched cable channel in America. They were worried about the terrorists immobilizing us, and a portion of our countrymen watch weather. 'Kay, you don't get any more immobile than that... unless you're in a goddamn coma. That means you're saying, ""I'd go to the window, but it's too far."" If you want to know what the weather is you go to a window and stick your hand out and if you want to know what the temperature is you drive by a bank. || I have N'Sync and Aerosmith and Britney Spears. I have a trifecta from hell. || There are things about the Jewish religion that I carry with me to this day. Chief among them is Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, as it's so happily called. It had a profound effect on my innocent young mind. The service opens with the organ playing ""Kol Nidre,"" one of the spookiest pieces of music ever written. You hear it and literally are surprised bats and shit aren't flying around. || Nyquil comes in two colors, red and green, and it’s the only thing on the planet that tastes like red and green. || All the candy corn that was ever made was made in 1911. || I'm just so looking forward to seeing Dick Cheney because it's like the sighting of a rare white elk when he shows up. And I don't even think it's Dick Cheney anymore. We see him so rarely that I think he may be my old shop teacher. || If you want to elect Bush, that's the prick that I'm gonna yell about. If you want to elect John Kerry, I'm gonna be yelling about him. My problem is with authority. || You'll always feel good about your body when you go to the International House of Pancakes - no matter what your body is - because there's always someone there who weighs 350 pounds more than you’ll ever weigh. || What does the word 'meteorologist' mean in English? It means liar. || What I find most disturbing about Valentine's Day is, look, I get that you have to have a holiday of love, but in the height of flu season, it makes no sense. || Stupid presidents, smart presidents, white presidents, black presidents - doesn't work! What this country needs is a crazy Third World dictator. And Donald Trump has what it takes to be that. He's already got a plane with his name on it, solid gold buildings, a harem... || You know a religion has no sense of humor, when a guy can stand up and say, ‘you know, if you commit suicide for Allah, after you die you will be met in heaven by 70 virgins,' and nobody in the room just goes, 'Ahahaha! Son of a bitch! That was great!' || It has been way too cold this winter, I mean th-th-th-the temperatures have been ungodly, where the fuck is global warming when you need it!  || North Korea is the country that the monkeys in the Wizard of Oz came from. || Here's why I think there's something a little odd with George Bush. Because a lot of the times when he speaks, his words don't match his face. Something is askew. You can't talk about the war with a smile on your face. He does it constantly. If you're the President, you should go ""We're going to talk about the war, I must have a frowny face."" The only time you can smile when you're talking about the war in Iraq is when you go, ""Well, two Iraqis walk into a bar, hahaha."" || A father and two sons run Adelphia. It's a cable company. And they took from that company a billion dollars. A billion. Three people - three people took a billion dollars. What were they gonna do, start their own space program? 'Let's send the monkey to Mars, Dad!' || There are no fights in Ireland, people just get so drunk they go, ""Goddamn, ya sonofabitch!"" and pass out. And there's no Alcoholics Anonymous there, because if there's a meeting, it's always at the bar. || The weather is out of control throughout the entire country. Where ever you go, it's 90, then it's 30, then it's 80, then it's 20, and my balls can't take it. They're big and then small. Big, small, big, small. Apparently, I can't have kids, cause my sperm are gagging. || Online, there's no time. It's always Christmas. || I think comics in New York are interested in being comics. And there're comics in L.A. who are touring comics, who are certainly more interested in stand-up, but a lot of L.A. stand-ups are really looking to do something else. || I think one reason people play golf is it allows them to obsess about something other than the daily crap. It takes your mind off that. || I was broke until I was 40. Really broke. I could get by, but I had nothing. || How our government works... it doesn't. || If I wanted to be bored by 6,000 pages of unreadable dreck, I'd read War and Peace four times. || The reason you should go to Las Vegas is because, for only the second time, the second time, ever, they have rebuilt Sodom and Gomorrah. It's back!! And you have the opportunity to see it before it turns to salt. || See... What I felt they should have done, for our first public works project, is build a giant wall... across the entire border of Canada. Because that's where the cold air comes from. || Let's face it, Americans are fat all year round, but the holidays are when we really hit our stride. And you can bet the food we eat will be just as unhealthy as the families we're forced to visit. || If you listen to a song and get an image in your head, and then you go home and watch mtv and the image they're showing is the same as the one in your head, kill yourself. You're better off coming back as a lobster. || Writing is thinking and thinking is hard work. || I'm not big on Halloween. I never have been. As a kid my parents would send me out to collect for UNICEF, which just screws up the whole holiday. You're wearing a costume and people are giving you pennies and you're going, ""Well, give me some candy, you fuck."" And the grown-ups tell you, ""Absolutely not. You've got your pennies. Now go build a village, you little shit."" It still brings a tear to my eye. || If you're seeing a psychiatrist, you're wasting money because all you've got to do is get on a plane, get on a subway tomorrow and, inevitably, you're going to be seated in front of some guy who's playing with himself, and he'll be singing, 'Happy Days Are Here Again.' I tell you - when I see that guy, I feel pretty good about myself. || I would love to have the faith to believe that the world was created in seven days... but I have thoughts... and that can really fuck up the faith thing, just ask any Catholic priest. || What is the difference between a Democrat and a Republican? A Democrat blows, a Republican sucks. || Now, most of the time you couldn't be too sure of the quality of the drug. Although, in my experience the stuff was always of a very high quality, because back then we didn't have business majors peddling lower-quality stuff in an effort to increase profits. || If you don't drink 56 bottles of water a week, scientists say you should take a garden hose at the end of the week and shove it up your ass. || People believe that Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days, and that's a 'liar, liar, pants on fire' situation. Most Jewish families don't make it past the fourth day. It doesn't happen - 'Come on, aren't we going to light the lights?' 'Eh, no. Enough's enough.' || The thing is, whenever I see Hillary Clinton, I feel like I have to vote for her. She makes me feel guilty because I feel like I should vote for her so that she'll feel better about herself because she'd been in such a bad marriage. || I knew that I'd lived in New York too long when, a few years ago, I was on a subway going downtown, and it stopped at 14th Street. At the station, the doors opened, and the conductor announced that there was a bomb on board and we should evacuate immediately. Nobody moved. We just looked at each other, 'Do you see a bomb?' 'I don't see a bomb.' 'There’s no bomb.' 'I've only got two stops - let's go for it.' || I don't know if watching Chaz Bono will turn your kids into transsexuals, but I'm pretty sure that letting them watch Keith Ablow will turn them into assholes. || Why would you hire MTV to do music? MTV has nothing to do with music, ok? MTV is to music as KFC is to chicken. MTV is video, and video goes where? In your eye, music goes in your ear. Ear eye, eye ear, big fucking difference! Music is like a drug, when you hear it you have a vision, and that vision can change over time or remain the same. || Oral sex should be an Olympic sport because it’s harder than curling, and if you’re good at it, you deserve a medal. || If I get a week off, I'll go to a hotel that has a golf course. I like to come downstairs and go right onto the course. I'll do that five days in a row. || I believe that every paper in the country should have one headline that when you read it, you laugh so hard you can't stand it. It has to be that way. What about a headline like this: 'Hippo Eats Dwarf'? How good is that? You read that headline, and you immediately close the paper and say, 'Wow, it's gonna be a great day.' || And I know this happens because I took economics, and I'd explain it to ya, but I flunked that course. Not my fault. They taught it at 8 o'clock in the morning. And there is absolutely nothing you can learn out of one bloodshot eye. || In my lifetime, we've gone from Eisenhower to George W. Bush. We've gone from John F. Kennedy to Al Gore. If this is evolution, I believe that in twelve years, we'll be voting for plants. || I'm a selfish, little pig of a man. || I do have certain feelings. My feeling is that whoever is in charge, I want him out. || Who knew that the devil had a factory where he made millions of fossils, which his minions distributed throughout the earth, in order to confuse my tiny brain? || They've gotta stop reporting wind chill. That's nonsense. It really is. I don't know where they came up with it, why they came up with it, but it's a lie. They come on, ""Well, it's 27 degrees today, but with the wind chill, it's minus 3."" Well, then it's minus 3, asshole! I don't need to know what the weather was like if the conditions were perfect! || I would like to play Pebble Beach at some point. I keep waiting for them to call and ask me to that little pro-am thing, but I'm not big enough. || Each of us is full of shit in our own special way. We are all shitty little snowflakes dancing in the universe. || That's the funny thing about religion: it doesn't matter what you say, you're going to upset someone. || In a series of wonderful essays, Evan Handler gives himself up to us - warts and all. To our amusement and bemusement we share in his emotional growth as he struggles to mature. I not only laughed along with him but felt that I too had grown a little along the way. Who could ask for more? || I never thought that Bill Clinton should be the president. When he was running to be the president of the United States, he said on over a hundred occasions, he said the following: He said, 'One of the great accomplishments while I was the governor of Arkansas, was to take my state in education from 50th to 49th.' And I thought, ' you know, Bill, you should keep that a secret.' || He smiles so much, I don't think he has a central nervous system. || When I was nine, my life was devoted to seeing a tit. I was Captain Ahab, and it was my big white whale. I'd go down to Sears on a Sunday in hopes they'd remove a clothing from a mannequin. Sad but true, sad but fuckin' true. || I was on CNN in Atlanta at one o'clock in the afternoon because apparently everybody else was asleep, and they asked me what I thought of CNN and I said, ""I liked CNN until you started that writing on the bottom."" I don't know why it's there. Why do you put writing on a television set? We watch TV because we don't wanna read! We want somebody to read the shit to us so we can close our eyes and touch our nuts! || He's a guy who's in charge of determining our energy policy, and he's doing it with $31 million of oil company money in his pocket. Is anybody fucking home? || I don't know if you know about pilots. The way in which our country generates television, they take one episode, one, and then they take that episode, produce it, and show it to a room filled with monkeys. And if the monkeys don't shit themselves, you might have a hit! || Health clubs aren't healthy. In New York City, which has the most stairs of anywhere in the country, people pay money to go to a health club and use a stair master. When you live in a city, that has nothing but stairs and you pay money to use special stairs, that is not healthy behavior. It's fucking psychotic! || There are packs of baboons running around Africa that take better care of themselves than we do. You know what health insurance is for me? I've got Band-Aids in my car. || I have no religion because I was born and raised Jewish. And on the first night of Hanukkah, my parents, when I was very young, gave me a top to play with. They called it a dreidel. I knew it was a top. And as I looked at that top, I said, 'You know. I don't think I'm gonna be Jewish for very long.' || People go to Vegas, and they don't know what to do; here's what you do. You go to the casino in your hotel. On your arrival, you get $100 in quarters. Take that $100 back to your hotel room and stare at it for a long, long time. Why? Because you're never going to see them again. Then you take those quarters to the bathroom and you flush them, one by one by one. And the nice thing about that is that every so often the toilet will back up, and you'll feel like a winner!  || I love New York City. The reason I live in New York City is because it's the loudest city on the planet Earth. It's so loud I never have to listen to any of the shit that's going on in my own head. It's really loud. They literally have guys come with jackhammers and they drill the streets and just leave cones in front of your apartment; you don't even know why. Garbage men come; they don't pick up the garbage, they just bang the cans together. And if your block's too quiet, they actually hire a guy who wanders around going, ""Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!"" ... That was the first job I ever had. || Because when you say ""shit"", it makes them cry. ""Why didn't he say 'poopie'? Why didn't he say 'poopie'?"" || It was a really special winter wasn't it?... if you're a fucking moose! If you've got fur on your nuts it's been a fucking festival! || We don't have seasons anymore. You know why? We lost the ozone layer. Well, put it on milk cartons - let's find it! || I'm always amazed when I hear people saying; ""That George Bush, he's a great leader"". And I wonder, where can one find a drug that would make one so delusional? || You don't want another Enron? Here's your law: If a company can't explain in one sentence what it does, it's illegal. || Valentine's Day: the holiday that reminds you that if you don't have a special someone, you're alone. || I don't care who wins because I go to sporting events to scream. It's the one place on the planet you can shout anything you want. You can bellow at will, and nobody will bother you. I yell things like, 'My life sucks! Dan Quayle is a schmuck! If I don't have sex soon, I'm going to explode!' Parents turn to their kids as I leave the stadium and go, 'Hey, there goes a great fan.' || iPod now has music on a fucking credit card. Eventually they'll have it so that you wear underwear and you just hear it in your head. || But what about the children, Lewis? I can hear some of you asking. What about the children? It's more disturbing to hear adults talking about having seen a tit as shocking and disturbing and indecent than it is for children to see one. || Whenever someone says they believe the earth was created in 7 days, I grab a fossil and say, ""Fossil."" And if they keep talking, I throw it just over their heads. || Everyone of you has a health that is unique and totally different from everybody else. Completely! Because we... are all like snowflakes. || Wise men say that time is like a river. I say time is like a river of shit... and as you float down that river in your little canoe, your paddles are getting smaller and smaller. || I don't believe pumpkin pie is even made from pumpkin. I mean, how can something that smells that shitty make a pie so sweet? There's not enough sugar in the universe. || This book is dedicated to all of my friends who helped me get to where I am today - you know who you are... and when I find you I am going to kill you. || Then there was the man who declared in court, he wasn't a person. ""Excuse me, sir, why haven't you paid your taxes."" ""Well, as you can clearly see, I am not a person."" ""Well, you look like a person."" ""No it's all done with mirrors, trust me!"" || When I was a kid, you ate, and you drank, and you passed out and nobody woke you up and said, 'Let's go shopping.' || We're the greatest country on Earth except when it comes to getting shit done. || You don’t even know what they’re selling until the very end: three rabbits are on a log, and one of them goes home and hangs himself - 'Buy a bike!' || You know what would help the instruction form? Verbs! Verbs would be nice! Because they help you get to the end of a thought! || Everybody's family has different values. || ""Equestrian,"" by the by, is the gayest word in the English language. In fact, I thought ""Brokeback Mountain"" should have been called ""Two Equestrians."" || N'Sync and Aerosmith are two bands that don't even belong in the same state as each other! || They should have a store next to the bookstore called the shit store where you can get shit books to read while on the shitter. No one reads great literature on the shitter. || Apparently there is no profit in the unique, or not enough to make it worthwhile to preserve. Ultimately it drains the life out of us, and existentialism starts to make more and more sense. || Now I must leave you as you enter the world that is Fuck. You are fucking lucky to be here. It's almost utopian. || Anybody who likes writing a book is an idiot. Because it's impossible, it's like having a homework assignment every stinking day until it's done. And by the time you get it in, it's done and you're sitting there reading it, and you realize the 12,000 things you didn't do. I mean, writing isn't fun. It's never been fun. It's momentum, and once you get the momentum going, that's great, but it's a brutal experience in many, many ways. And when you're done, people tell you ""Well, gee, I'm not interested."" ""Great, I'm glad I sat down and wrote this!"" || If you stop eating donuts you will live 3 years longer. It's just 3 more years that you want a donut. || They're so broke that they've actually cut essential services. In many places, they've cut policemen, because, who the fuck needs them? Or firemen, son of a bitch, it's much more fun watching something burn down. || Americans continue to rapidly homogenize ourselves into a neutered oblivion. For a country founded on the protection of the unique, we relish our sameness. || We are all shitty little snowflakes dancing in the universe. || If you ask your congressman why, he'll say Because it's hard. It's really hard. Makes me want to go poopie. You know why we don't have solar energy? It's because the sun goes away each day, and it doesn't tell us where it's going! || You ever read the ingredients in sunblock? I've never seen those words anywhere. You don't even know what you're putting on your face, do you? You go, ""Oh no, the sun's out!"" It could be zebra cum; you don't know. You may not like that joke, but you don't know. || The whole Valentine's thing is fine, but you don't back it up right next to the biggest gift-giving holiday of the year. Unbelievable. And we find it acceptable. || My touring has never stopped; from the time I started doing stand-up, I've been on the road. || My father worked at the Naval Ordnance Lab, and they had a nine-hole course on the property. You paid a quarter. || I've got stuff about airline mergers, which just shows that my stand-up is getting more insane by the minute. || I've seen the end of the universe, and it happens to be in the United States and, oddly enough, it's in Houston, Texas. I know - I was shocked, too. Imagine my surprise when I left a comedy club one day and walked to the end of the block, and there on one corner was a Starbucks, and across the street from that Starbucks, in the exact same building as that Starbucks, there was - a Starbucks. I looked back and forth, thinking the sun was playing tricks with my eyes. That there was a Starbucks across from a Starbucks - and that, my friends, is the end of the universe. || I'll tell ya, in New York City, where I've lived far too long, 'fuck' isn't even a word, it's a comma. || While I was in Miami, they stole my rental car, because apparently, they didn't have enough time to load up a gun and shoot me. On the street, there was a Lexus, a BMW, and in the middle was my car; the rental car. The Plymouth Horizon. Here's a math problem for you, don't ponder it too long or your head'll explode, but how many drugs would you have to consume, in what period of time, to be on the street and go, ""Well, I gotta have the Horizon! Are you kidding me? I've never driven a car that's aqua!"" || If you really think there's a Santa, why don't you sit on the front steps all night in the freezing cold and see if he climbs down any chimneys tonight. Good luck. And since we're a family that isn't lucky enough to have a chimney, how would Santa get into our house? Does he bring a locksmith with him? And it probably would have to be a Jewish locksmith, because a Christian locksmith is going to want to be home with his family. And how many Jewish locksmiths are there? None. || There are people who believe that humans dinosaurs co-existed, that they roamed the Earth at the same time. There are museums that children go to, in which they build dioramas to show them this. And what this is, purely and simply, is a clinical psychotic reaction. They are crazy. They are stone-cold-fuck nuts. I can't be kind about this, because these people are watching The Flinstones as if it were a documentary. || Earth Day was created because we were doing a lot of drugs, more drugs than you could ever imagine. And so we came up with Earth Day, so we'd have one day that would remind us what planet we were living on. || I've always really liked theater. It fascinated me. You can create a reality and get people involved in that reality. It takes place in real time. || I'm not a great joke writer, which is odd for a comic to say, but I'm not. || Some people have religion as a means of solace. But, I had a dreidel, so that was out. || These ballot initiatives remind us that America is the land where people are free to dream whatever they want, so long as that dream doesn't make Midwesterners feel icky! || Ninety percent of a shirt that not only was bright purple and green but with a design on it that, if you moved too quickly, might cause a seizure in an unsuspecting onlooker. || I was home alone watching George Bush speak on television. So it was just really the two of us. And as I listened to him, I realized, that one of us... was nuts! And for the first time ever, I went, 'Wow, it's not me!'"
Louie Anderson,"I have a very warm spot in my heart for Vegas. || A real estate closer. Oh, what's that? I'm a real estate opener. What is a real estate closer? You mean at the end where you've got to sign all those papers? || I was with a famous comedian when a young fan walked up and asked for an autograph. The comedian blew him off. I'll never forget the look on the young boy's face. He was devastated. || I'm going to be talking about food, being fat, and being over 50 - all the 'F' words. || I have a cousin Ernie who buys stuff. He's got a big snowblower that's actually the biggest snowblower you can buy, with a remote control, so he doesn't even have to go outside. He's got the microwave and a satellite dish, it's all in one. He cooks and watches at the same time. || Dr. Phil was very helpful and caring. I believe he helped all of us there and watching how to better relate, understand, and communicate with our families and loved ones. Dr. Phil recommended reading my new book. || It's so much easier to be cynical. || I'm a 7 o'clock act. My people want to go to a show, a dinner and then go home and go to bed. || My mom was a garage sale person, save money. Come on in to the garage sale, you might find a shirt. She'd get in that garage sale and point stuff out to you. There's a good fork for a nickel. Yeah, that's beautiful. It's a little high. If it were three cents I'd snap it up. || I've been in Vegas. That's where you get into the money thing. Boy, you get greedy in Vegas, you know. That's the only place that you can bet $25, get it up to $500 and refuse to quit. || I felt ashamed for what I had done. I don't have any excuses. I did what I did. I take full responsibility for myself and my actions. I wouldn't pawn this off on anybody. I'm sorry it happened. And I hurt people. || My inspiration is coming more and more from the way I feel and the gratitude I feel. The older you get the more humility you have. || After 34 years, I feel like I did when I was starting out. I feel excited and feel I've never been better doing what I do. || I have added a lot. There's some Vegas stuff and hotel stuff and a whole chunk on health. || I live in California, the worst place in the world for fat people. There are three of us. They have us on eight-hour shifts, so it works out. || Credit-card debt and day trading-I feel like Michael Corleone in Godfather III, just when I think out, they pull me back in. || I started a big part of my career in Vegas. || My first words were ""Seconds, please"". Most kids in kindergarten napped on a little rug. I had a braided 9x12. || You have to be funny about it and honest about it. You can't leave yourself out of that mix. You have to be honest enough to say, I'm that messed-up one in the family. || We were on welfare when we were kids. Thanks for reminding me of that. || We all think we're going to get out of debt. || Minnesotans really think they run the whole world, I love that."
Louis C. K.,"Every day starts, my eyes open and I reload the program of misery. I open my eyes, remember who I am, what I'm like, and I just go, 'Ugh'. || I like pressure. Pressure doesn't make me crack. It's enabling. I eat pressure, and there might be times when I get a bad feeling in my gut that this might be too much, but you feel pressure when you're not doing something, you know? || You know, the people who do indie film and decide who gets those little budgets? They're mean, man. They're cold and very cool-oriented. || Perception is created and twisted so quickly. || Nice to be here. I had a good day today I went to a movie. Before the movie now they show you that presentation where they explain that you shouldn't download movies on the Internet because you're hurting all the people that work on them. They need to feed their families so you shouldn't download the movies. And I saw this and I thought, ""Wow, I had no idea. I didn't know you could download movies on the Internet... I don't care about those people."" || I find that when people laugh it's usually because they're connecting and identifying in a way that they hadn't considered. That's my payoff. I'm not interested in other people thinking differently. I don't care. I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, ""I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives"". || I don't believe in this idea of, 'That's hate speech, stop it.' || I ate too much and masturbated too recently, you know? It's bad to like jerk off and run out the door, 'cause you run into somebody. ""Oh, she knows..."" You got to take some time alone to process the shame. || I wish I could know everything ever, like that would be my wish - that's what I hope heaven is, that they tell you who shot JFK and all that stuff. || My uncles were all funny. My dad wasn’t funny, but my uncles were all funny. Now I go back and I like him better than them, they were manipulative funny. || It's just a big excuse to say awful things. || The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time, and if you don't give up, you will get better. || Last week I got a flu that I caught, 'cause my daughter coughed … into my mouth. || It’s been a very old thing for people to gather together and laugh at stuff. The first comedian in America really was Abraham Lincoln. He used to go to a pub near where he lived and stand in front of the fire and he packed the place every night and he would just talk and bust everybody in their guts. He was just a hilarious speaker and that’s what he did. || Sometimes I just want to tell a story regardless of whether it fits what the show is saying. I’ve been in a lot of writing rooms where somebody says an idea and everyone’s dying, like laughing so they’re delirious. It’s like a black hole in a good way, everything starts to fall into it, you know what I mean. || Fuck it... That's really the attitude that keeps a family together, it's not ""we love each other"", it's just ""fuck it, man."" || I thought about going to NYU film school - that was this ideal to me. But I didn't make any kind of grades in high school. || You have to be really tenacious. You have to keep at it. There are many roads to get there. If you can get yourself into Harvard, that’s a good way to go, because every Harvard graduating class, the agencies come trolling around and they’ll look for you. So if you go to Harvard, you’ll get found there. || I don’t feel those limits when I’m on stage. For some reason, audiences let me get away with things. Remember, it’s all comedy. Words. Thoughts. All thoughts are safe and worth exploring. || Everybody is different. Some comedy is more musical like Steven Wright. His is a pillar of comedy to me. He invented a whole form and all his jokes are poems. So it's different. I wanted to do it like George Carlin. Now I do it like me. || I just don't trust any of it. Every time I read something about how there's been another ridiculous climb of the Dow Jones, there's a part of me that goes, “This can't be good.” None of this is real money. You know what I mean? It's not like there's actually more of anything. It's just ideas. When people are getting richer and richer but they're not actually producing anything, it can't end well. || I thought for like five years that when you have sex, you come and one of your balls comes out. That's what I thought happened, that you have to come a ball out of that little whole at the tip of your dick. I was terrified! That's what I thought, you just... Bahh! And you push a ball out and she's screaming and there's blood everywhere...and you can only do it twice and then you're out of balls. That's what I thought. You come and have two babies, and then you just walk around with an empty sack for the rest of your life. Which turned out to be true... || I can't sit down and write jokes. I just flows in from some maddeningly elusive place. Believe me, if I had an Alaska in my brain, I would drill baby drill, and I'd cum right on Sarah's back while I was there. || I always tell my kids to cut a sandwich in half right when you get it, and the first thought you should have is somebody else. You only ever need half a burger. || It's really the kids that do you in. We have two kids. That's fucking stupid. Don't do that. || I’ve always benefited from knowing machines well, because it’s freedom, it gives you freedom, I always knew that. || If you study something and you find all this stuff about it, you just went skin deep, so if you keep going and going, you should be left with a fucking mess of unanswered questions. || I don’t know if you’ve ever had just five dollars in the bank, but I’ve found that if that’s all you have, you can’t get it out. || Very few American parents give a crap about how they raise their kids. They put minimal effort into it. Who told you it’s a good idea to buy a developing mind a video game? || Nobody ever wins an argument. Nobody ever goes, 'Oh, I'm wrong.' Somebody eventually just goes, 'Shut up. We gotta eat, so let's shut up for minute.' || I hate when people ask me the time on the street 'cause something happens to me. I just panic. I can't read my watch. When I'm alone, I'm great at reading my watch, but when someone asks me, I just have this anxiety attack, and I just can't make it out... I always end up saying something useless, like, 'It's 20 of 9:40.' || I did that on a date once - I was wearing a bathing suit under my pants because I didn't do laundry. She wouldn't have known except for I had that white string flapping outside of my fly. She was like, 'What do you have - a tampon in there? What the hell's wrong with you?'  || That's a very white attitude. You can take a white guy to Africa, and he'd be like, 'Look at all the minorities they got over here. Jesus!' || I think the idea of fucking someone who just watched you perform is... it's just not me. || If you do something and people think you're stupid, just go for crazy. You get more respect that way because nobody likes stupid people. || I do actually use a boxing trainer when I train for stand-up. || I used to like people more, but now I have children and that changes your life in a lot of ways. Like you spend time with people you never would have chosen to spend time with, not in a million years. I spend whole days with people, I'm like, ""I never would have hung out with you. I didn't choose you. Our children chose each other based on no criteria by the way. They're the same size. They don't care who they make me hang out with."" || I've had two great years, probably five good years. So I had 20 years of just kind of uncertainty and suffering and ego destruction and poverty. All these things. There's no way I'm ever going to catch up to the misery years. It's impossible... If I don't do anything dumb or I don't get a disease or something, and then I've got to five to eight years I think where it'll really be great and then it will start to degenerate like uranium, you know? || I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, ""I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives."" || When you're a father in a marriage, you sort of become the mother's assistant. And you sort of get a list from her every day and you run down the list and it feels very much like a chore. || Bill Gates has 90 billion dollars. If I had 90 billion dollars, I wouldn't have it for long because I would just dream of all the crazy stuff I could do with it. This guy, 90 billion dollars. He could buy every baseball team and make them all wear dresses and still have 88 billion dollars. || I grew up in Boston, and in Boston, people just beat the shit out of each other for no reason. They just beat the shit out of each other. But I kinda think you need that to keep quality control 'cause in places where it doesn't have it, they're too free. || Look, it's some cunt coming out of that cunt's cunt. || It's in the Ten Commandments to not take the Lord's name in vain. Rape isn't up there, by the way. Rape is not a Ten Commandment. But don't say the dude's name with a shitty attitude. || 'I had to sit on the runway for 40 minutes.' Oh my god, really? What happened then, did you fly through the air like a bird, incredibly? Did you soar into the clouds, impossibly? Did you partake in the miracle of human flight and then land softly on giant tires that you couldn't even conceive how they fucking put air in them? You're sitting in a chair in the sky. You're like a Greek myth right now.  || You can figure out how bad a person you are by how soon after September 11th you masturbated, like how long you waited... and for me it was between the two buildings going down... I had to do it, otherwise they'd win. || I like all ladies of all different ages. || One time, I threw a candy wrapper on the street. I was with a friend who said to me, ""You just littered on the street! Don't you care about the environment?"" And I thought about it, and I said, ""You know what? This isn't the environment. This is New York City. New York City is not the environment. New York City is a giant piece of litter. Next to Mexico City, it's the shittiest piece of litter in the world. Just a pussy, runny, smokin', stinkin' piece of litter. || I don't stop eating when I'm full. The meal isn't over when I'm full. It's over when I hate myself. || I like being full, every day, with stuff that I have to do. || I love comedians. They're my community. || Drugs are so fucking good that they'll ruin your life. || I'm pretty sure 100% of animal sex is rape. It's just all rape. || Well, my wife assassinated my sexual identity, and my children are eating my dreams. We don't bother you with that. We just say ""Great."" || I'm a good citizen. I'm a good father. I recycle and I masturbate. || I spend enough time onscreen looking hangdog and depressed. || When girls go wild, they show their tits to people. When women go wild, they kill men and drown their kids in a tub. || I think one reason TV has always done well is because there is something comforting where you kind of know what you're going to be taken through. || I've started to kind of hate people, and it's not because I have anything against them. It's just, I enjoy it. It's recreation. || I have a crazy amount of different jobs, so the way I manage that is to not do more than one at a time. It's like old computers that had small memory chips, they would do something called swapping, where they would fill the memory with one task, do it and get it out. || There's a woman I see who's not my therapist, but she's like an old friend who's a therapist in profession. She lets me talk to her like a therapist once in a while, and she does a great thing. Whenever I have a big dilemma, like this is a big problem in my life, she always says, 'Wow, you're going to have to figure that out.' || Gay men have to go through something to own their - who they are. They get beat up. They get ostracized. Whatever they go through, if they survive it, they come out very confident people. || A very painful part of being a parent is having really negative feelings about your children when you love them so much. || Well, when I was younger, I lied all the time, because once you understand the power of lying, it's really like magic because you transform reality for people. || My kids are really easy. I often worry that they're too easy to deal with. They're really nice people. || I got tits now, too. I just got tits! That is a fucked up day in a man's life, when you look in the mirror and you realize, ""Fuck! I got..."" Because you don't see them coming, they're sort of pouting out little by little, and then one day they just fuckin' fall a little and that's it, you have tits. And they're there for good. They're not gonna like go back, it's fucking over.  || Anytime you see a bit where some stranger does something to me, it's me. || I was driving in Manhattan. There's traffic, nobody's moving... The guy behind me is honking just at me. He kept yelling at me. I decided that I'm gonna argue with this guy, but I'm gonna argue about something else. I'm not having his argument; I'm having mine. So, he's like, 'Go!' And I go, 'Well give me back my jacket!' And he stopped. I was like, 'Yeah, you got my jacket! Give it back! I said you could borrow it, not have it! You're stretching it out, you fat pig! Give it back, now!' He got back in his car, and he locked his doors. || Comedians work great as actors because they're good under pressure. With a lot of actors, you have to make them feel like everything's going really well to get a good performance out of them. But, if you have a comedian on the set, you can tell them, 'Hey, you really are screwing this up,' and then they just get better. || For my scale, how I grew up and live my life, I'm making plenty of money. || I do feel a lot of times like I'm out of my league with my kids in terms of what my responsibility is. || I don't know what it's like to be an actor, where if your show gets canceled, really you're just a bum. || I don't think it makes any sense to try to get anyone to not talk. || I get mad like anybody else does, but being able to laugh about getting mad is very healthy, and my kids know that. || I grew up watching all these crazy movies, European movies and stuff, and I guess that I always laughed at things that were a little more offbeat. || I know what it's like to have a bunch of material that's working that you don't care about. You want to die. || I'm not condoning rape, obviously. You should never rape anyone. Unless you have a reason like you want to fuck somebody and they won't let you, in which case what other option do you have? How else are you supposed to have an orgasm in their body if you don't rape them, like what the fuck? || A man will cut your arm off and throw it in a river, but he'll leave you as a human being intact. He won't fuck with who you are. Women are non-violent, but they will shit inside of your heart. || I'm not a political comedian. That's just not what I do. || I've never sucked a dick. Isn't that weird? My whole life! That's weird to me. It is! It's weird. Because almost everybody has sucked a dick, when you think about it, most people on earth suck dicks. It's true. Because 51% of the population are women and they suck dicks. Then there's all the gay guys who suck dicks. Then there's all the straight guys who have been forced to suck a dick under various circumstances. So there's only like a thousand of us out there who never blew anyone. Just a bunch of selfish assholes that are fuckin' gettin' blown and not blowin' back, you know. || People get successful and they start saying, 'Well of course I am! I was chosen! I'm special!' No, you're not. || I have a lot of beliefs and I live by none of 'em. That's just the way I am. They're just my beliefs. I just like believing them. I like that part. They're my little ""believies."" They make me feel good about who I am. But if they get in the way of a thing I want, or I want to jack off or something, I fuckin' do that. || You've got to be optimistic to be single. Stupid. You have to be stupid. That's what optimistic means, you know. It means stupid. An optimist is someone who goes, ""Hey, maybe something nice will happen!"" Why the fuck would anything nice ever happen?! What are you stupid?! || Some entertainers don't pay attention to what's going on around them. || Sometimes I try to take a nap before shows. That clears my head. || There's no real preparing at home for stand-up. You just go and you just do it. || Farts are - I just refuse to be snobbish about certain shit with comedy. You know, farts come out of your ass and they make a fucking trumpet sound. That shit smelling gas comes out of your ass and it makes a toot sound. What the fuck is not funny about that? It’s perfect, it’s a perfect joke. It has all the elements. || To me, it's very exhilarating when somebody else does a great thing, and it's not me. || When I am in a hotel, and I turn off the lights and the TV, I just freak out. I turn the TV back on and don't get any sleep. || When I take my kids out for dinner or lunch, people smile at us. || Most people are dead. Hitler. Ray Charles. Some other guys. But mostly those two. || You can't cancel my stand-up tours. It's impossible. There's too many separate bosses. There is no 'bosses.' || You can't direct without a good crew. || Television for a child creates such a high bar of stimulus that nothing else competes. A beautiful day is absolute crap to a kid who watches tv. || Life's too short to be an asshole, as an employer or as an employee. || All these words we use, anybody can be a genius now. It used to be you had to have a thought no one ever had before or you had to invent a number. Now, it's like, ""Hey, I've got a cup in case we need another cup."" ""Dude, you're a genius!"" || My dick is too aware that your pussy is a chamber of financial ruin! || People don't talk to me on airplanes. || I'm buying a Cinnabon … at the airport … I arrived at. You understand why that's extra disgusting, right? Because when you're at the airport you're leaving from, you can say, ""Oh, I gotta eat. I need some food, because I might be trapped in the sky forever, so I should eat right now."" But I've landed. The trip is over. I'm 20 minutes from my house, where I got bananas and apples and shit. And I'm sitting on my luggage just fucking eating a Cinnabon with a fork and knife. || We have white people problems in America. That's what we have, white people problems. You know what that is? That's where your life is amazing, do you just make shit up to be upset about. People in other countries have real problems. Like, ""Oh, shit. They're cutting off all our heads today."" Things like that. Here, we make shit up to be upset about. Like, ""How come I have to choose a language on the ATM machine? It's bullshit. I shouldn't have to do that. I'm American."" || I'm not sure why I'm so often disgusting on stage. I don't always know where it comes from. || If I do something for my kids, I get a medal, because most fathers don't. || Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird, but it's true because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce … That would be sad. If two people were married and they were really and they just had a great thing and then they got divorced, that would be really sad. But that has happened zero times. || I did a show in New Jersey in the auditorium of a technical high school. Technical high school, that's where dreams are narrowed down. We tell our children, ""You can do anything you want."" Their whole lives. ""You can do anything!"" But this place, we take kids - they're 15, they're young - and we tell them, ""You can do eight things. We got it down to eight for you."" || People say 'my phone sucks.' No it doesn't! The shittiest cellphone in the world is a miracle. Your life sucks. Around the phone. || It's like Platoon. You've got all this fucking stuff; you have an impossible amount of shit to carry, and usually, a kid sometimes too. And I see parents all over the place with skinny little ankles and, you know, with no particular features and they just, life's worn them down to a basic like human shape, you know. Their personality and whatever they, the lines in their face and the chiseling is gone. They're just this thing and it's like ant strength, and you just have to, you just have to do it to get through whatever fucking, you know, we've got to get from here to there. And she didn't want to be here any more, and she has to go to the bathroom, and I've got a stroller. || If I owned a network, I would never let a guy just put people on without telling me who they are. || It's hard to know where your thoughts come from, especially when you have a thirst for material because you need it professionally. || Oh, I love stand-up. || I'm not an atheist. I think god is there and that he is watching and he made us. I just don't give a shit. I don't ""believe in god."" I have zero idea how everything got here. I would personally say that, if i had to make a list of possibles, God would be pretty far down. But if I were to make a list of people that know what the fuck they are talking about, I would be really far down. || Kids are like buckets of disease that live in your house. || When I read things like ""the foundations of capitalism are shattering,"" I'm like, maybe we need that. Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey with pots clanging on the sides. Because everything is amazing right now and nobody's happy... In my lifetime, the changes in the world have been incredible. Now we live in an amazing, amazing world and it's wasted on the crappiest generation of just spoiled idiots that don't care, because this what people are like now. They've got their phone and they're like ""Uh, it won't"" Give it a second! It's going to space! Can you give it a second to get back from space? Is the speed of light too slow for you? || First of all, I came immediately, and also I started farting as I came. That's how my sex life started. Fucking shame and depression. || It's a positive thing to talk about terrible things and make people laugh about them. || If you're a cartoon character or most TV characters, sure, you'll fight, because the punches are juicy-sounding and they don't leave marks. But in real life, if somebody punches you in the eye, it doesn't make any noise and your eye is swollen for, like, six months. It's a nightmare to get punched in the eye. || Plenty of crazy people in New York. There are so many crazy people here, I think it's like one out of every one person is completely out of their mind. || I'm not motivated to entertain people through Twitter, so just by having Twitter and not saying anything, I make people mad. || I don't like comedy. I like funny things. I don't like comedy. Like, comedy movies are just, 'Oh Jesus.' || There's no such thing as a cheap laugh. || I'd like to name my kid a whole phrase. You know, something like ""Ladies and Gentlemen"". That'll be a cool name for a kid. ""This is my son, Ladies and Gentlemen!"" Then, when he gets out of hand, I get to go, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please!"" || Sorry, Americans only buy things that come from suffering. They just enjoy it more when they know someones getting hurt. || I like to talk to strangers. I like to go up to people I don't know and just start conversations with them, just start a conversation. Try it. But the way I do it, don't start the conversation in the beginning, just start it in the middle. Try it. Just go up to somebody you don't know and and just go, 'Well how do you think I felt?' || Why can't we have racism that's ignorant but nice? You could have stereotypes that are positive about race. You could say, ""Those Chinese people, they can fly!"" ""You know about the Puerto Ricans... they're made of candy!"" || When I read things like the foundations of capitalism are shattering, I'm like, maybe we need that. Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey with pots clanging on the sides. || It's more fun to experience things when you don't know what's going to happen. || There’s nothing that beats proving you’re funny by making a funny thing, and right now there are huge outlets for that, with You Tube and all the other stuff online. || You're all gonna die. Then you'll be dead for way longer than you're alive, like that's mostly what you're ever gonna be. You're just dead people that didn't die yet. || How many advantages can one person have? I'm a white man! || I really think it's crazy that we hit our kids. It really is. Here's the crazy part about it. Kids are the only people in the world that you're allowed to hit. Do you realize that? They're the most vulnerable and they're the most destroyed by being hit, but it's totally OK to hit them. And they're the only ones! If you hit a dog, they fucking will put you in jail for that shit. || Friends should always tell you the truth. But please don’t. || The earliest stand-up comedy I was aware of was Bill Cosby. I watched Saturday Night Live as soon as I was aware of it, and Monty Python used to be on PBS at weird hours, so I used to try to watch that. And I loved George Carlin on SNL, that was the first stand-up I ever really remember seeing on TV. And then Steve Martin. I guess I was in fifth or sixth grade when Steve Martin showed up, and he was instantly my idol. And Richard Pryor around the same time too, I sort of became aware of him, though I don’t remember the first time I saw him. || I would rather be with my kids than anybody else. || I read something in the paper that really confused me the other day. It said that 80 percent of the people in New York are minorities... Shouldn't you not call them minorities when they get to be 80 percent of the population? That's a very white attitude, don't you think? I mean, you could take a white guy to Africa and he'd be like 'Look at all the minorities around here! I'm the only majority.' || I think you have to try and fail, because failure gets you closer to what you're good at. || I definitely look at my body and I go: 'Yuck.' || I can feel how an audience is reacting when I’m on a stage, but when you are on stage, your perception is distorted. That’s something you just have to know. It’s like pilots that fly at high Gs and they lose, sometimes, consciousness and hand/eye coordination and they just have to know that that’s going to happen. They have to be trained to not try to do too much while they are doing that. So when you are on stage, you have to be aware that you are wrong about how it feels a lot of times. || There's two kinds of press that you get when you put out a TV show: The reviews, and the people that just decide what the reviews say. || The thing is, comedy's gone in a weird direction. People are really into ironic comedy and fakeness and cleverness. || The only pitch I have to movie people is the same as this one: Just give me $8 million. I'm not telling you what it's about and I'm not telling you who's in it. || Pushing the envelope' sort of implies that you're inside the envelope with everyone else, and you're trying to find the edges on the outsides. || I'm enjoying the work while I get it right now. || Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I'm very suspicious. It doesn't make sense to me that you'd have the same solution to every issue. || Comedy isn't polite and it isn't correct and it isn't accurate, even. It's just a mess. So that's the way that I approach it. || If you're a woman and a guy's ever said anything romantic to you, he just left off the second part that would have made you sick if you could have heard it. || I really love Barack Obama. Sorry if that’s like “Ew. The president. That’s lame.” I love Barack Obama. What a great man. I’m so lucky to have voted for that guy. || America's a family. We all yell at each other. It all works out. || The Jackass movies are honestly some of the best movies I've ever seen. I laugh so hard at them. Those guys are geniuses. If they had grown up with a different group of people, they could've been performance artists at Bard College, and people would be writing papers about them. || Well, I think ""likability"" is an overused word. I don’t watch people 'cause I like them; I watch them because they’re compelling. Sympathetic is a little different. Likable just thins you out. Working to make a character likable is what kills most TV shows. || I'd love to have a shitty job. I couldn't hold any down. Standup was the only thing I could stick with. I'm an idiot that way. || The last jobs I had were fixing cars and covering football games for a local access TV station. As in driving the mobile van to the field, setting up 3 cameras, teaching depressed grownups and interns how to use them and directing the game from the van and then wanting to kill myself. || Being popular with an audience is a very rickety ladder to be on. || I don't care about the weight. You know, I'm lucky; I'm one of those people - I can eat donuts, whatever, and I just get fat. || I could never sit down and write jokes. || Breaking records is not something you expect to be doing. That's like a sports thing, it's not usually a comedy and writing thing. || One thing I learned from drinking is that if you ever go Christmas caroling, you should go with a group of people. And also go sometime in December. || Being single at 41 after ten years of marriage and two kids is difficult. That’s like having a bunch of money in the currency of a country that doesn’t exist anymore. || Dating is horrible, it's awful. I don't get it. It's like you're standing there: 'Hi. Do you want to have sex and later wish you hadn't?' It's horrible. And it's awkward at 42 because I don't have the body or the drive. I just sit in the car and hope somebody gets in. || I don't like waking up. I feel like staying in bed usually, but I can't because I've got two kids standing next to my bed, just eager to live another day. || After you do standup for for, like, five years, you're kind of screwed because you have no other skills. You can't get other jobs. It's like being in prison: you're not suitable for any other career. || I've had, what, two years? Probably five good years. Before that I had twenty years of uncertainty and suffering and ego destruction and poverty. All those things. That'll always outweigh the good times. || God is like a shitty girlfriend. || I like New York. This is the only city where you actually have to say things like, 'Hey, that's mine. Don't pee on that.' || Technically, I've learned that having good legs and wind is good for being on stage. You have to be in shape and have endurance. || The problem is, the more famous you get, the more people see you who didn't choose to. || There's been a lot of simple vilification of right-wing people. It's really easy to say, 'Well, you're Christian, you're anti-this and that, and I hate you.' But to me, it's more interesting to say, 'What is this person like and how do they really think?' || When I got divorced, I thought 'Well, there goes my act.' || When two kids are being completely berserk, and they're naked and throwing food around, sometimes I just let it go because I can see a future where they're going to be dressed, and they're going to be at school. So I kind of let stuff go sometimes. || You have to be aware of who you're talking to in an audience. || Even after 9/11, during the darkest moment of our recent history, the President told us, “Go shopping.” That's how we were told to uphold American values; go out and fucking buy more shit. So what were we supposed to do? || When I was first divorced, I started dating younger women, and it was really exciting. But after a while I was like, 'This is just dumb.' || Most people are dead. Did you know that? It's true, out of all the people that ever were, almost all of them are dead. || Life is full of horrible mistakes. || A lot of TV is put together by teams, by writing staffs and several different directors. It's a great, very smart way to make television. It's worked for however long TV's been around. || I was a nerd growing up, and I'm a little antisocial and awkward. || I don't have a room full of writers pitching ideas. It's just me out of my head. || A lot of the struggle I had with movies is I really loved moments and tones and feelings in a scene, and I loved creating those, but I never really had great stories to string them together. || Talking is always positive. That's why I talk too much. || ""I'm bored"" is a useless thing to say. You live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen none percent of. || I've learned from experience that if you work harder at it, and apply more energy and time to it, and more consistency, you get a better result. It comes from the work. || Everything that people say is testable. || I never viewed money as being 'my money' I always saw it as 'the money.' It's a resource. If it pools up around me then it needs to be flushed back out into the system. || I think I'm past any window where I'm suddenly going to become surprisingly ripped so that people go, 'Oh, my God, what happened to you?' || I've met a lot of people who've lost their jobs and they still have a sense of humor. || I've tried to do away with lying in my life in the last few years, but it's hard. || It's easier to cancel a show if it's expensive. || It's kind of awkward to eat alone in a restaurant because everybody's looking at me. || I don't think women are better than men, I think men are a lot worse than women. || I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping as we all should. I dunno. You don't live that long. It doesn't matter. || Twitter and Facebook and MySpace; all that stuff makes you warped. We've all basically given ourselves data entry jobs. I've actually heard people say things like, “Aw shit, I have to update my Twitter.” Really? You have to? That's a big priority for you? || To me the goal of comedy is to just laugh, which is a really high hearted thing, visceral connection and reaction. || I do have very deep, fond memories of my family in Mexico City, but I also remember feeling funny for not speaking English - I was basically an immigrant. But I picked up the language fast and soon I knew that I wanted to be a writer. || There are people that really live by doing the right thing, but I don't know what that is, I'm really curious about that. I'm really curious about what people think they're doing when they're doing something evil, casually. I think it's really interesting, that we benefit from suffering so much, and we excuse ourselves from it. || I wish I could keep a journal. I have a lot of journals with one page half written in. I sometimes will write myself a quick email on my Blackberry when I think of something. || Who wants to blow their husband? You want to blow a guy that you've been dating. And he's mysterious and you suck his cock and go home. Who wants to blow a guy and then go to IKEA with him all day? || I’m a vulgar, fucked-up degenerate comedian who did drugs. And I’m connecting with Christian mothers and fathers. I love that. That means so much to me. || You could drive a rental car until you don't want it. Just get out of it while it's moving and just walk away. No, I don't feel like being in that car any longer. Just call Hertz. Hi, your car is drifting into the intersection of 28th and Broadway, if you're interested. It's now your problem. || My ex-wife, she really didn't like the material that I did. And that's something I regret, that I wasn't more careful about making sure that she was O.K. with it. I just sort of didn't ask. So that's how that goes. || Whenever single people complain about anything, I really want them to shut the fuck up. First of all, if you're single, your life has no consequence on the earth. Even if you're helping people aggressively, which you're fucking not, nobody gives a shit what happens to you. You can die, and it actually doesn't matter. It doesn't. Your mother will cry or whatever, but otherwise, nobody gives a shit. || What we’ve done with our modern food supply is absolute insanity. It’s not even real any more. You used to be able to give a kid an apple and they would love it. Kids can’t even taste apples any more. Apples taste like paper to kids now. || Cars and cameras are the two things I let myself be materialistic about. I don't care about other stuff. || My last name is Szekely. Sounds like Saykay. When I was a little kid I had an instructor in camp who called me Shnizneckely. He would make fun of my name and it hurt my feelings because I was a little pussy and I cried. He said, 'Well, how do you say it?' I said, Seekay. So he wrote 'C.K' on my jersey and everything. He made my name 'C.K' and I just stuck with it. || My bank is the worst. They are screwing me. You know what they did to me? They're charging me money for not having enough money. Apparently, when you're broke, that costs money. || To me, comedies are usually the least funny movies. Movies that are actually a comedy are usually not all that funny. To me Goodfellas and Raging Bull are two of the funniest movies I ever saw. || Now we live in an amazing, amazing world and it's wasted on the crappiest generation of spoiled idiots. || Everything that’s difficult you should be able to laugh about. || A household name is like ketchup. Everybody wants ketchup. Ketchup doesn't hurt anybody. || I've always loved boxing. It's something I've always been extremely excited about. || I've had soccer moms come up and tell me they can relate when I say that I want to throw my baby in the trash. || Life isn't something you possess. It's something you take part in, and you witness. || I don't have a gun, but if I did, I would shoot a baby deer in the mouth and feel nothing. || Don't smoke pot. Don't bitch. Don't give up. Go on stage anywhere. Try, fail, repeat. || Human kindness has no reward. You should give to others in every way you see. You should expect absolutely nothing from anyone. It should be your goal to love every human you encounter. All human suffering that you're aware of and continues without your effort to stop it becomes your crime. Humans are always evolving. If you do one thing that if done by every human would destroy the world, that makes you Hitler... I don't live by any of those. But I believe them all very strongly. || I don't have a brother in real life. || I love being married, it's great, but I hate arguing. I hate fighting. You know what I do now? When we get in an argument, I just take her side against me. It's just easier; it goes quicker. She's like, 'What's wrong with you?' And I'm like, 'I know! Damn it! Argh!' She wins most of them anyway. I might as well be on the winning side occasionally. || When you first get married, you have a relationship that's so important to you, and you're working on it together. But then you have a kid. And you look at your kid and you go, ""Holy shit, this is my child. She has my DNA. She has my name. I would die for her."" And you look at your spouse and go, ""Who the fuck are you? You're a stranger."" || We have white people problems in America. You know what that is? That’s when your life is amazing, so you just make stuff up to get worried about. || I am really tired of looking at my hips. I’m seriously really tired of standing naked in the mirror and staring at my hips for hours and hours while muttering, ""You hips. You hips need to get it together."" || I find that when people laugh really hard, it's usually because they're connecting and identifying in a way that they hadn't considered. That's my payoff. I'm not interested in other people thinking differently. I don't care. I'm not even educated; it's something that I'm not qualified to do. I'm just like yeast - I eat sugar and I shit alcohol. And there's a huge culture that goes with that. Alcohol creates massive shifts in world history, and it changes people's lives. People get pregnant because of alcohol. But the yeast doesn't give a fuck. The yeast isn't going, ""I really want to help people loosen up and bring passion into Irish people's lives."" || The Greatest Generation gets too much credit. Those World War II guys, if they had all the shit we have today, they'd be assholes too. It's just circumstantial. It's what you're called on to do that makes you great. We haven't been called on to do anything but buy shit and get fat. || Everything's amazing right now, and nobody's happy. || Most Americans have so much crap, that you could lose most of it and still have way more stuff than the average Canadian. || Shut up... let me tell you, let me. Every time I look at your face or even remember it, it wrecks me. And the way you are with me and you’re just fun and you shit all over me and you make fun of me and you're real. I don't have enough time in any day to think about you enough... I don't even think about women anymore. I think about you. || There’s nowhere I won’t go. As long as it’s horribly, horribly true and or wrong. || Whenever I've encountered a Christian saying, 'Why don't you stop talking like that so I can hear you?' I think, 'Well you're the one putting the earmuffs on, but I wish you could hear me because I like you.' || To me, art supplies are always okay to buy. || People are too afraid of uptown. A lot of people will tell you, like, 'Don't go to Harlem. You can never go there 'cause as soon as you get there, they kill you.' That's what people think. As soon as you arrive in Harlem, someone just stabs you in the face right away... That's people's image of Harlem: just everyone standing around waiting for lost white people to kill all day. || We spend all our time now on customer service phone calls. I used to read when I was on the toilet, but now that's when I make customer service calls. || I had five dollars in the bank that I couldn't have for three days until they charged me another 15. Leaving me with -10. What does that mean? I don't even have no money any more. I wish I had nothing. But I don't have it. I don't have that much. I have not ten. Negative ten. I can't afford to buy something that doesn't cost anything. I can only afford to get something that costs you give me ten dollars. || The other kid we have she's a girl and she's four. And she's also a fuckin' asshole. It's true man, I'm serious. I say that with no remorse. Fucking asshole, she's a douchebag. She is! Fucking jerk. || I'm close to my audience. I think I have more tools in my box than other guys who might try it. Also, I know how to do this stuff. I know how to write and shoot and edit. I'm technically adept and that helped with the website. You need a big skill set. || When you're young as a comic, you don't have a lot of leverage. || Credibility lasts about two cycles of bad material, and then you'll probably never get it back. If you let people down, that's really hard to come back from - harder than climbing from nothing to something, even. || It's hard to really look at somebody and go: ""Hey, maybe something nice will happen."" You just don't - I know too much about life to have any optimism, because I know even if it's nice, it's going to lead to shit. I know that if you smile at somebody and they smile back, you've just decided that something shitty is going to happen. || They charged me 15 dollars. That's how much it costs to only have 20 dollars. || I remember the day I saw my hair was thinning. I don't remember caring much. I don't care. It's just hair. It never bothered me much. I was pretty young, too. And it happened and is happening very slowly. I have a feeling dead people get really mad when we complain about losing hair. || I just always loved comedy and I really wanted to be good at it. And it was heartbreaking, 'cause I started and I wasn't good at it. I was only 17-years-old, so I had a lot to learn about life in general. But I just kept on trying. I was young enough and stupid enough and I had no other choice. I had nothing else I was good at. || There’s a need to perfect things in a writers’ room, and that can take a lot of fun out of a show sometimes. It’s a struggle. It depends on your personality. Some people love working with a writing staff. I had a great writing staff on Lucky Louie, but it sometimes felt like Congress or something. || You know what hilarious means? Hilarious means so funny that you almost went insane when you heard that shi... its so funny that is almost ruined your life. You're homeless now because you can't cope or reason anymore. Because that hilarious thing just shattered your mind and three months later you got shit and leaves in your hair and you're drenched in pee in the gutter. That's how funny hilarious is. || When you write from your gut and let the stuff stay flawed and don't let anybody tell you to make it better, it can end up looking like nothing else. || There’s a huge amount of work that goes into placating a network in regular television. It’s literally 70% or 80% of your workload, is showing them the material, getting their notes and presenting it to them and making sure they weigh in. It’s a huge amount of work."
Martin Lawrence,"If you don't believe in yourself, then who will believe in you? The next man's way of getting there might not necessarily work for me, so I have to create my own ways of getting there. || I know you think I'm crazy. I go into a different room and I actually felt like it takes me to a better place, positive instead of negative. || I didn't know the full facts of life until I was 17. My father never talked about his work. || We grew to know the meaning of love. That is what allowed me and my family to stay close together. || For me, this was all or nothing. I left no room for anything else. That goal was just for my own push, my own self-esteem. The fear of not being a success in my life made me push even harder. || I don't really judge. To each his own. You like what you like. If you want someone who's big-boned and you like that, ain't nothing wrong with having a little extra meat on there. If you like them thin-boned, then thats okay too. || It's always fun to be able to have a voice, because it helps me to stay in tune with the project and the people that I am working with. Ther's nothing worse than being on a project and not being able to have a voice. I don't like that. || My career and life are over, and I have nothing to live for. || Here goes all these rumors writin' about me. I see on the paper, one of'em says ""Martin tries to jump out of a plane using his jacket as a parachute."" Now ain't that some bullshit! As I'm trying to get my life together, they're gonna write that bullshit. I know damn well you can't jump out no plane using your jacket as a parachute. Shit, I know you got to use your pants. || Nobody's ever challenged me and tapped into what I can do. I ain't played a villain which I believe I can do and do real well. There hasn't been any director who has been able to challenge me to go there. At this point in my life I've done a lot of things from stand-up to my own television show for five years to successful comedy shows, and concert films. || I wanted to trust in my partners and the directors and producers and do the best I can to deliver what I could deliver. || No one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life. || You can be cool and at the same time respect your woman, who will hopefully become your wife, who will hopefully become the mother of your kids. America needs to get back to family values. || Sorry, I had told Craig and them I'm gon' kick it with them. Gotta go! See you when I see you! || If somebody pisses me off and I understand it ain't personal then I'll go to another place and I'll meditate. || Fatherhood means a great deal to me. I love it. To me, there aint nothing better, because your kids keep it real with you. When you think things are bad, you look at them and they show you how things could be all right, and it's all worth it. || Enjoy your popcorn and enjoy the jokes. It's just a movie, so have fun! || It's botherin' me, man. You know, ""you can't say this, you can't say that,"" I'm like, well, how am I gonna talk about the world? You know? I mean I need to talk about something to you all, can I - can I do it? Can I talk to y'all? I mean, I hope the kids are in bed, you know, because I got to talk, y'all.  || White parents use time out. My mom used a different type of time out. She'd be like, 'There... take time out to pick up your teeth.' || I don't live to eat, I eat to live. || Somebody put something in his mouth. My zipper's stuck. || Here’s a synonym for procreation... fuck you. || Go head on, with yo' fat apple pie ass, Aunt Bea! || You make due with the time you have here. Hopefully when you pass on, somebody can look back and say, 'Wow, they made a difference in some kind of way.' || There better not be a black person in here that says they don't know nobody in jail... 'cause that's bullshit. Ray-Ray, Earl, Craig, Shorty Tim, Lil' Reg, all them motherfuckers in jail... Shonda's little brother... all of 'em, in jail... chillin'. || Boxing kept me out of the streets, by giving me something to do. And it gave me a father figure in the coach that was there for me. I just reiterated what my mother was trying to teach me about focusing and getting my life together. || I don't want to sound facetious, but humour is the key to the soul. You know what I mean? || You used to be looking good from afar. Now you just far from looking good! || On the Wizard of Oz Lion's lookin' for some courage... Tin Man's lookin' for a heart... ain't none of them lookin' for some pussy, and they skippin' down the street with a bitch! || God inspired me, because I was blessed with the knowledge that I wanted to do this. And my mother supported it. She said, 'Whatever it is you want to do. If you believe acting or comedy is what you really want to do, I can only tell you it's not easy, it's very hard, but I'll support you.' Her supporting me enabled me to move forward. || I'm most proud of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me, in my life. He's given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down, but you can still get back up. Hopefully I'll learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing I do."
Milton Berle,"If evolution really works, how come mothers only have two hands? || I remember the first time I met Cynthia it was at the beach. I was digging for clams and I came up with her. || I remember every one of your insulting jokes... I use them later. || Marriage is one of the few institutions that allow a man to do as his wife pleases. || Folk who don't know why America is the Land of Promise should be here during an election campaign. || A committee is a group that keeps minutes and loses hours. || One of those Christmas songs says, “You better not shout, you better not cry, you better not pout.” How’s my wife going to get along? || We owe a lot to Thomas Edison - if it wasn't for him, we'd be watching television by candlelight. || My doctor recently told me that jogging could add years to my life. I think he was right. I feel ten years older already. || Santa is having a tough time this year. Last year he deducted eight billion for gifts, and the IRS wants an itemized list. || I just bought a great gift for my boss - a leaky ant farm. || A good wife always forgives her husband when she's wrong. || What is this, an audience or an oil painting? || Money can't buy you happiness, but it helps you look for it in a lot more places. || That's your little joke? Don't worry! We'll mop it up later. || My wife wants something foreign for Christmas - like a Mexican divorce. || I bought my mother-in-law a beautiful chair for Christmas, but she won’t let me plug it in. || You can lead a man to Congress, but you can't make him think. || They’ve got plastic Christmas trees now. They’re hard to tell from the real aluminum ones. || I bought a Christmas tree for twenty dollars. When I came home the next day, my wife was wearing it in her hair. || I bought my son a bat for Christmas. On New Year’s it flew away. || Valentine’s Day is the day when you remember that Cupid was a lousy shot. || At the Christmas party, the secretary with the long red hair ate three pickles, and four salesmen panicked. || Motivation is when your dreams put on work clothes! || Now that doctors have stopped making house calls, lots of patients now have to die without their help. || Jews don't drink much because it interferes with their suffering. || I'd rather be a could-be if I cannot be an are; because a could-be is a maybe who is reaching for a star. I'd rather be a has-been than a might-have-been, by far; for a might have-been has never been, but a has was once an are. || Experience is what you have after you've forgotten her name. || I bought my kid an educational toy to help him make it through life. No matter how you put it together, it’s wrong. || I bought an ideal gift for my mother-in-law - a battery-operated mouth. || That is not a Bob Hope joke! That is a no hope joke. || Remember that night you did that oriental cooch-cooch; the cops came and threw you in the can-can. || A man is hit by a car while crossing a Beverly Hills street. A woman rushes to him and cradles his head in her lap, asking, Are you comfortable? The man answers, I make a nice living. || In Washington, a man gets up to speak and doesn’t say a thing, and the other men disagree with him for three hours. || I don't mind personal insults, but when you insult the jokes that I tell you're insulting Fred Allen, Bob Hope, Burns and Allen, Trevor McGee and Molly Picon. || I take New Years with a grain of salt and three aspirins. || On Valentine’s Day, I wired flowers for my mother-in-law, but she found the fuse. || My wife sent me a Valentine card that said, “Take my heart, take my lips, take my soul.” That’s just like her. She kept the good parts for herself. || The TV news people keep saying that this could be the greatest Christmas we ever had. I kind of thought the first one was. || The Post Office is very careful nowadays. When they get a package marked “Fragile,” they throw it underhand. || Talk about cheap - on Christmas Eve, my neighbour shoots off three blanks and tells his kids Santa Claus just committed suicide. || My son has a big Christmas problem - what do you buy for a father who has everything and you’re using it? || It’s always consoling to know that today’s Christmas gifts are tomorrow’s garage sales. || In the suburbs it’s hard to buy your Christmas gifts early in the year. You never know who your friends will be in December. || I was in a department store and I saw a weird-looking gadget. I asked the young saleslady what it was. She answered, “It doesn’t do anything. It’s just a Christmas gift.” || I had a great Christmas. I received a lot of presents I can’t wait to exchange. || The company accountant is shy and retiring. He's shy a quarter of a million dollars. That's why he's retiring. || At Christmas you can get real bargains. I saw one item marked down ten dollars. It was a yacht. || Remember those magical nights Cynthia... we would dance cheek to cheek. I'd rub my stubble against yours. || All of your life you were crazy about cars, I guess that's why you turned out to be such a crank. || Laughter is an instant vacation. || I never stole a joke in my life. I just find them before they're lost. || I'm 83, and I feel like a 20-year-old, but unfortunately there's never one around. || I just filled out my income tax forms. Who says you can't get killed by a blank? || Poverty is not a disgrace, but it's terribly inconvenient. || I live to laugh, and I laugh to live. || I feel like Zsa Zsa Gabor's sixth husband. I know what I'm supposed to do, but I don't know how to make it interesting. || This is how it is today: The teachers are afraid of the principals. The principals are afraid of the superintendents. The superintendents are afraid of the board of education. The board is afraid of the parents. The parents are afraid of the children. The children are afraid of nothing! || I just got wonderful news from my real estate agent in Florida. They found land on my property. || Why are we honoring this man? Have we run out of human beings? || He's so old that when he orders a three-minute egg, they ask for the money up front. || Mr Gallop you have a beautiful tale there. If you wear your coat long enough no one will notice it. || Remember when I met you on the high seas Cynthia how coy you were. You tried to get away from me and what a fight you put up. You bent four of my harpoons. || I know why superman left krypton. Earth was the only place where he could get steroids! || A man falls down a flight of stairs and somebody rushes over to him and asks, ""Did you miss a step?"" ""No,"" he answers, ""I hit every one of them!"" || They've finally come up with the perfect office computer. If it makes a mistake, it blames another computer. || Remember when you had your face lifted... and the guy brought it back. || That's a vicious rumour! A rumour started by a few million people. || We grew together. I grew up. She grew sideways. || What an orchestra! They just sit there, but their minds are thousands of miles away with their bookies. || You look like a normal person, if you can find a normal person who wants to look like that. || The only place success comes before is in the dictionary. || I bought my son an indestructible toy. Yesterday he left it in the driveway. It broke my car. || I gave my wife a twenty-five-dollar gift certificate. She used it as a down payment on a mink coat. || I wanted to get the guy who works next to me in the office something he really wants, but how do you wrap up a saloon? || My sister-in-law found a real surprise in her stockings - my brother. || My son asked for very little - a kickstand, with a motorcycle attached. || My son gave me a nice bottle of cologne - Eau de Owe. || My wife and I were shopping for the whole family. In the music department my wife said, “Let’s get your nephew a set of drums. That’s what your brother did to us last year.” || My wife can’t figure out what to buy me. What do you give a man who’s had everything up to here? || Our local department store had two Santas - one for regular kids and one for kids who wanted ten toys or less. || She wanted an Italian sports car - with the sport still in it. || There are a lot of things money can’t buy. Not one of them is on my son’s list. || War toys are scary. They have a rocket launcher with a bayonet attached, in case you miss. || All my wife wanted for Valentine’s Day was a little card – American Express. || I like to do things for my wife on Valentine’s Day. I open the door for her when she puts laundry in the washing machine. || My son really has the spirit of Valentine’s Day. When he was in college, he used to send his mother a heart-shaped box of laundry. || My wife is a real Puritan. She thinks licking the stamp on the envelope of a Valentine is foreplay. || She was nice to him on Valentine’s Day. She gave him a heart-shaped rash. || The only thing that can break a piece of Valentine candy is another piece of Valentine candy. || Valentine’s Day – a nice holiday because it’s the first day of the rest of your wife. || Valentine’s Day is like Armistice Day – you declare a truce. || If it wasn't for the olives in his martinis, he'd starve to death! || Radio... that wonderful invention by which I can reach millions of people... who fortunately can't reach me. || I listened to Jack Benny on the radio last night, he was so funny I dropped my pad and pencil. || Every year my boss used to give me a bottle of expensive brandy because I’d told him that my doctor suggested a drink once in a while. This year my boss gave me the name of a new doctor. || A thing of beauty is a job forever. || I gave my wife a gift certificate for Christmas. She ran out to exchange it for a bigger size. || I made a terrible mistake last Christmas. My wife made me swear that I wouldn’t give her a fancy gift. And I didn’t. || Our Christmas tree was so puny we used orthopedic bulbs. || This man’s wife told him, “For Christmas, surprise me.” On Christmas Eve he leaned over where she was sleeping and said, “Boo!” || I like to think of myself as the middleman between Fred Allen and Henny Youngman. || It’s amazing how fast later comes when you buy now! || An adult western is where the hero still kisses his horse at the end, only now he worries about it. || Do you want to feel insecure? Count the number of Christmas cards you sent out, and then count those you received. || Don't tell jokes only the band laughs at. || How proud you were when they named you America's best... then you found out they meant America's beast! || I can't tell you his age, but when he was born the wonder drug was Mercurochrome. || You look like something the dog just buried in the backyard and is trying to forget where. || Anytime a person goes into a delicatessen and orders a pastrami on white bread, somewhere a Jew dies. || If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door. || For Christmas the just came out with a battery-operated battery. But the batteries aren’t included. || Your marriage is in trouble if your wife says, 'You're only interested in one thing,' and you can't remember what it is. || I have a brother who is afraid to go to sleep, he dreams he's working. || I always wanted to write a book about you Cynthia, but somebody beat me to it. He wrote The Hounds of Baskervilles. || A young man fills out an application for a job and does well until he gets to the last question, ""Who Should we notify in case of an accident?"" He mulls it over and then writes, ""Anybody in sight!""."
Mort Sahl,"We claim we believe in compassion, which is an abstract, and when it's personified we discredit the man. || If anybody comes up to you and says, ""My kid is a conservative - why is that?"" you say, ""Remember in the 60′s when we told you if you kept using drugs your kids would be mutants?"" || Those who the gods would make rich and famous on TV, they first drive mad. || Hillary’s explanation of the Libyan action to Congress was so good, I wonder who explained it to her? || One reason to keep going is that the country was given to us as a sacred charge. It is, as Stephen Vincent Benet says in 'the Devil and Daniel Webster,' not the only place that created free men - but its a place that demands that we decide what to do with out freedom. You can only punish yourself, That's the existential view. I don't think there's any reward beyond participating, beyond being here. And the antithesis of reward is punishment, and the only punishment that can come is self-inflicted. I remain optimistic. Whether or not the optimism is justified, I don't know. I want to stay around for the third act. || There's a danger our fiscal bankruptcy might overtake our moral bankruptcy. || New book on Malcolm X says we don’t know how he was killed. Want to bring in the FBI. Maybe they were in already. || Would you buy a second-hand car from this man. || Remember when movies were just good or bad, before auteurs, film festivals, and guys from USC who were the first to shoot underwater? || One thing about being narrow-minded: you'll never be lonely. || We would have broken up except for the children. Who were the children? Well, she and I were. || In the forties, to get a girl you had to be a GI or a jock. In the fifties, to get a girl you had to be Jewish. In the sixties, to get a girl you had to be black. In the seventies, to get a girl you've got to be a girl. || I found people looked better when they laughed. || My whole life is a movie. It's just that there are no dissolves. I have to live every agonizing moment of it. My life needs editing. || People tell me there are a lot of guys like me, which doesn't explain why I'm lonely. || We all know that America is the worst country in the world, except for all the others. || That feeling of hopelessness only serves your masters. || The distance between taking social action and having the knowledge is as wide as the mouth of the Mississippi. || This matter of two sides to every question is bad logic and bad practice: sometimes there are no sides; sometimes there are a hundred. || Now that Obama is at war in a 3rd country, does that mean he has to give back his Nobel Peace Prize? || He was wearing a velvet shirt open to the navel. And he didn't have one. Which is either a show business gimmick, or the ultimate rejection of mother. || Most people past college age are not atheists. It's too hard to be in society, for one thing. Because you don't get any days off. And if you're an agnostic you don't know whether you get them off or not. || Every time the Russians throw an American in jail, the Committee throws an American in jail to get even. || I've arranged with my executor to be buried in Chicago. Because when I die, I want to still remain active politically. || If you were the only person left on the planet, I would have to attack you. That's my job. || There's so much Botox around now that you can't tell when a Jewish girl is angry! || I’m for capital punishment. You’ve got to execute people. How else are they going to learn? || In addition to optimal atmosphere, the tight-knit staff at Kelly's made performers feel welcome and above all respected. Elsewhere, that wasn't always the case. I made some good friends there. It was a wonderful place. You never missed home when you were there. I was having a good time, and people were awfully good to me. || Television is never more false than when it's openly sincere. || Bush is the face on the can. But who canned that soup? || There were four million people in the Colonies and we had Jefferson and Franklin. Now we have over 200 million and the two top guys are Clinton and Dole. What can you draw from this? Darwin was wrong! || I took benzedrine - I got clairvoyance. With benzedrine you can have a very wide view of the world, like you can decide the destiny of man and other pressing problems, such as which is the left sock? || Remember that no matter how selfish, how cruel, how unfeeling you have been today, every time you take a breath, you make a flower happy. || If you maintain a consistent political position long enough, you will eventually be accused of treason. || Everything I tell you is true, but this is factual. || Women want their men to be cops. They want you to punish them and tell them what the limits are. The only thing that women hate worse from a man than being slapped is when you get on your knees and say you're sorry. || I took a course at Cal once called Statistical Analysis. And there was a guy in the course who used to make up all his computations and he never used Sigma. He used his own initials. 'Cause he was the standard deviation. || I met this girl... very aggressively... I just walked up to her and I said ""Who are you? I have to know who you are."" It's a good opener, but you can't sustain that level of excitement. Later on chicks start complaining the relationship doesn't have that much drive anymore. You have to remind them, ""I'm the guy who ran up and said ""Who are you?"" And they always say ""Well, you never do that anymore."" And you have to say ""Yes, and I still don't know who you are. || 'She looks great but what'll I say to her in the morning.' I'm searching for the new maturity: she looks great, but I have nothing to say to her now. || I went to computer class with my Dell and I was bullied by a guy with a Mac. || I don't think crucifixion is the answer. I believe in the resurrection. I like that part of the story. || You know what I want you to do? I want you to blow out the candle and curse the darkness. || I don't think fascism is dying for. || There are Russian spies here now. And if we're lucky, they'll steal some of our secrets and they'll be two years behind. || What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas - except the drone. || I made the mistake early in my career, when I moved to Hollywood, of being attracted to actresses. I used to go out exclusively with actresses and other female impersonators. || I'm not a liberal, I'm a radical! || Obama is running again for spite. || Liberals feel unworthy of their possessions. Conservatives feel they deserve everything they've stolen. || If you can't join them, beat them. || Washington couldn't tell a lie, Nixon couldn't tell the truth, and Reagan couldn't tell the difference. || If someone were to ask me for a short cut to sensuality, I would suggest he go shopping for a used 427 Shelby-Cobra. But it is only fair to warn you that of the 300 guys who switched to them in 1966, only two went back to women. || The beat generation is a coffeehouse full of people expectantly looking at their watches waiting for the beat generation to come on. || I watched Ken Burns' Civil War series on PBS. My favorite segment is when Bob Hope entertains the troops at Gettysburg. || Obama said he went to Libya because of his conscience. Did anyone ever wrestle with his conscience and lose? || Those who learn nothing from history are condemned to rewrite it. || When Obama ran, he said, ""We can change the world!"" The world: can you change it back?! || A Yuppie is someone who believes it's courageous to eat in a restaurant that hasn't been reviewed yet. || I never met a man I didn't like until I met Will Rogers. || Nixon's the kind of guy that if you were drowning 50 feet off shore, he'd throw you a 30 foot rope. Then Kissinger would go on TV the next night and say that the President had met you more than half-way. || Professional comedians, surprisingly, have a lack of humor. They're insensitive to the insanity of our times. || The fact is that you can't have a good relationship with a girl who hasn't settled things with her father. || You know me, I love lost causes. || I don't believe in good people and bad people. I believe in the better parts of people. || You haven't lived until you've died in California. || Reagan won because he ran against Jimmy Carter. If he ran unopposed he would have lost. || Obama says his recreation consists of reading the Constitution... looking for a loophole. || The bravest thing that men do is love women. || A conservative is someone who believes in reform. But not now."
Norm Macdonald,"It got very tedious saying the same jokes in the same way with the same attitude. || After months of speculation, the sitcom star Ellen DeGeneres admitted that yes, she's gay. Inspired by her courage, today, diet-guru Richard Simmons admitted that he is really, really, really, really gay. || Note to self... Sex with blow-up doll is not as good as advertised. || They're like ''You're an alcoholic.'' I go ''No, I'm not.'' and then-apparently that's what alcoholics say too, you know? || He has the disease of alcoholism. And he came to me... and he told me, and I'm the kind of guy that likes to look at the bright side of things. So I told him, I said, 'Richie, it's true that you have a disease and everything, but I think you got the best one.' || I've just seen really, really funny guys, and if I didn't know them, I wouldn't know they were funny from the television. I don't know what it does, it just sucks it away. || Pulp Fiction is a, uh, gritty, urban satire. Pump Friction is a uh-uh, a bunch of uh, dudes and ladies having dirty sex. || I went to a hypnotist. He put me under a spell, and every time I had a craving for a cigarette, I would throw up. It's very embarrassing right after sex. I find it pretty hard to get that second date after that. Girls get all snobby after you barf on them. || I think clever people think that poor people are stupid. || I saw this one - it was for cat food - at the end of it, it says, 'All natural food for your cat.' All natural food? But cat food's made out of horse meat. Yeah, that's the way it works in nature: the cat, right above the horse in the food chain. || You ever hear guys with small cocks talk about sex? Can't talk about it enough. They even got poems. They'll say, 'It's not the motion of the ocean, it's the boat of the lotion.' I've even heard variants..., ""it's not the tree or the size, it's the axe that you wax.' It's a whole sub-genre of poetry now that's taught in many of our finer institutions.  || Many people are skeptical about marriage of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Pressley. They say, Lisa Marie is more of a sit at home type, while Michael Jackson is more of a homosexual pedophile. || When I hear a guy lost a battle to cancer, that really did bother me, that that's a term. It implies that he failed and that somebody else that defeated cancer is heroic and courageous. || Scientists believe they may have discovered a primitive form of life on Jupiter's moon Europa. That primitive form of life? You guessed it, Frank Stallone. || I was in my peak physical condition when I was about like, uh... one. Oh God, I looked good, young and fresh! You wouldn't know me now if you'd seen me when I was one, you know? I even looked good for my age. People would come up to me and go, ""what are you, zero?"" And I'd go, ""no, I'm one over here!"" || I always told everybody the perfect joke would be where the setup and punch line were identical. || I don’t do much. I’m too lazy. That’s my problem. Hang around my couch, watching the TV. Just too lazy. I realized this the other day, I get hit my a truck tomorrow - a big truck could hit me - paralyze me from the neck down. Wouldn’t effect my lifestyle a bit really. || I'll tell you why nobody knows, 'cause, people forget a very important thing. The Chinese are a lot smarter than us... So, it's hard to-to criticize. But some things, we excel at that they don't, you know, it's - I mean, I have never seen a Chinese guy in a porno. || I don't care for sex. I find it an embarrassing, dull exercise. I prefer sports, where you can win. || Back in the old days, a man could just get sick and die. Now they have to wage a battle. So my Uncle Bert is waging a courageous battle, which I've seen, because I go and visit him. And this is the battle: he's lying in the hospital bed, with a thing in his arm, watching Matlock on the TV. || I'm not gay, so I don't know much about Broadway musicals. || Actually, with those dirty movies, I find like, they're good for about fifteen, twenty minutes. I'm really interested. And, then, uh, there's one point, that all of a sudden I'm bored. You know? I just lose interest completely and I feel deeply ashamed. || Last Christmas, I got the worst gift a guy ever gave me. He gave me a lottery ticket... what’s the guy even thinking there. ""Here you go... nothing! Merry Christmas! It’s nothing!"" || Ever see this? It’s a homeless guy but he’s got a dog... The dog’s really thrilled with this idea. The dog’s going, ""Hey pal, I can do this by myself pretty well. The longest walk in the world you got me on here."" || I don't really like politics that much. And I like the order and simplicity of sports. They have an ending. You can argue with your friends about it, but in the end you still like sports. I almost love the fantasy world of sports more than the real world. || All kinds of violence on the TV. You're not supposed to watch violence on the TV. Children, they can't watch it 'cause they're afraid maybe the kids will copy something they see on the TV. I can't even get a funny cartoon anymore because some 12-year-old somewhere watched a particularly violent episode of the Road Runner-Coyote show, and the next day, they found him at the bottom of a canyon, two giant springs strapped to his feet. || Sex couldn't be simpler. I think there's only like five things you can do in the whole fucking thing. You ever think you invented a sixth? Then later you go, 'Ah, in all humility, I guess that was pretty close to number five.' || They say that if you're afraid of homosexuals, it means that deep down inside you're actually a homosexual yourself. That worries me because I'm afraid of dogs. || You ever see 'The Dating Game'? That's a weird game show. The prize on that show: another contestant. Talk about cheap. || Comedy is surprises, so if you're intending to make somebody laugh and they don't laugh, that's funny. || You ever lie for no reason at all? Just all of sudden, a big lie spills out of your evil head. Like a guy will come up to you, 'Hey, did you ever see that movie with Meryl Streep and a horse?' And you go, 'Yes.' In the back of your head, you're like, 'What in the hell am I lying about over here? I stand to gain nothing by this lie.' || There's no such thing, of course, as an old-fashioned gay guy. They're the most decadent people. || You know, with Hitler, the more I learn about that guy, the more I don't care for him. || Kenny G will be releasing a CD fully comprised of Christmas songs. Happy birthday, Jesus - hope you like crap. || I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure... if you die, the cancer also dies at exactly the same time. So that to me is not a loss; that's a draw. It's not like... the cancer's going to jump up and go, ""Arrrgh I fucked Uncle Bert's wife, where is he? I won fair and square."" || I sort of try to write everything for me. I'm a huge sports fan but have no interest in minutiae. I don't remember who won Super Bowls five years ago or listen to sports talk radio. I'm trying to make sure the jokes are self-contained so they're accessible to everyone. || I like doing a funny show where I don't have to act and fall in love with a girl. || I just like doing standup, that's all I'm interested in or good at. || 'I want you to buy this pit bull. This will protect your valuables.' I don't own anything very valuable. If I buy the pit bull, that would be the most valuable thing I own. I'd have to buy something to protect it then.  || I just got back from New York. You ever been there? There was a big gay parade going on there when I was there, and I never been to one of them, and I like a parade. I always like a parade. So, I go there, and it turns out, it's just a bunch of gay guys. || The subtext of every one of these beautiful poems is that it doesn't matter how big your cock is, it's what you do with it. Like the guy with the giant cock would have no clue.  || The Rolling Stones reunited for a twenty-fifth anniversary tour last week. Keith Richards said that he's happy to continue to do what he's been doing for the past twenty-five years: cheating death. || Man, them engagement rings, boy, they cost a lot. I was looking at 'em. Cost like a thousand bucks, two thousand bucks, y'know. Three thousand bucks. Something like that- four thousand bucks. Big number divisible by a thousand, anyways. || It's tough to know who's better in cliff diving. Like, you see a guy diving off a cliff and you go, ""Oh, man, a guy diving off a cliff! And then another guy'd dive- ""Oh, there's another guy diving off a cliff there. But you can't tell who's better, y'know? Like, uh- if you survive at all, hey, you're a great- you're a great cliff diver there. There's only two classifications in cliffdiving. There's, uh- 'Grand Champion' and then, uh- 'Stuff On a Rock.' Very hard to make a comeback in that sport, I'll tell you that. || I would love to stay at SNL forever. But you can't stay in the same place. People think you're a loser. || You know, I don't think Richie would go to my Uncle Bert and go, 'Hey, I understand you got bowel cancer. Oh man, I know how you feel, I gotta drink a lot of booze. What's your symptoms, Uncle Bert?' 'Well, my bowel, I got blood pouring out of it all the time? and I got searing, clawing pains?ripping, tearing, mind-screeching bowel pains?and they're combined with aching, dull, soul-deadening bowel pain. Those are basically my symptoms; how 'bout you?' 'I get happy. I tend to be able to talk to people easier, I find. Sometimes, I'll meet a lady at a bar, got the same disease I do, and I'll fuck her.' || This is the amount of time you think about sex: every once in a while. The problem becomes, when you think about it, it's all you can think about. It encompasses your whole brain. You're like a fucking werewolf or something. Usually you're a civilized human being, but then every couple of days, you?re like 'arrrgh.' Then you've got to close the blinds. || You ever be having a really good dream, and then, uh- right in the middle of the dream you wake up, right in the best part of the dream? And there you are, back in your stinkin' life again? Man, that's rough, eh? || This is a thing I read by a scientist... it said scientists now say that a man thinks about sex once every 7.3 seconds. Now, I know what I think every 7.3 seconds. It's just a bunch of meaningless gibberish."
Pat Cooper,"We need to try to work out something so folks can be there. We're going to try to find some solution so we don't have to keep repeating ourselves during the regular meeting. I think it is a board issue, but we're just going to try to make some suggestions. We would be open to doing the meetings at a different time. || When I was a boy, we had forty five statues of saints in my house. Ever have ninety eyes looking at you every time you have to go to the bathroom? || The new breed of comics are completely different than what I did. || One time I visited my mother and found St. Anthony's statue upside down. I say, 'Mama, why's St. Anthony upside down?' 'He don't answer my novena, he stays that way!' || One of my sisters wanted to be an opera singer. So, we spent a few dollars to try to train her, because Italian people would like to have an opera singer in the family. But she's got trouble coughing, let alone singing. One day, she was in the shower singing 'Madame Butterfly,' three days later the Japs attacked Pearl Harbor. || When I got older I said, ""Pa, I want an automobile."" He said, ""What do you want an automobile for, when you have the subway. Five cents - the open the door for you, you sit down. Then when you get to the station they open the door and you get out. In a $700 auto who's going to open the door for you?"" You couldn't argue - they were never stuck for an answer. || I say, when you tell the truth, you never offend nobody, particularly if you do it with dignity. || I remember on Thanksgiving all the kids wanted the drumstick. There were four of us then. Well, today you can go into the supermarket and get 12 drumsticks. Years ago you couldn't do that. So I was sucking on the neck for two years. My mother told me it was the leg, and I believed it. I went to my father and said, ""Why is my leg always cockeyed?"" He said, ""The bird has arthritis."" || When my mother would make me sandwiches for school - zucchini and eggs, pepper and eggs, everything was with eggs - the oil would drip out of the bag. She didn't care if I lost the sandwich - she wanted that brown bag back. She used to give me artichoke sandwiches. You have no idea how embarrassing it is to sit in the schoolyard eating an artichoke with a piece of bread. A lot of kids didn't know what it was, they'd say, ""Look at that guy eating flowers!"" || We said to them to take all of the students who are troubled students and work with them. They're not bad. They're troubled because they don't have what you had and what I had growing up. It was tough, and it's still tough, but Jodi and her staff are making it work. These are the kids that would have been out on the street robbing and stealing.  || Today when kids receive their confirmations you have to give them a contract that you're going to buy them a car. I wanted a bicycle, and as I got a little order I was told Santa Claus might bring me a bicycle. Then one year my father borrowed a bicycle at Christmas, put it under the tree and I rode it all that day. The next day it wasn't there. ""Where's my bicycle?"" My father said, ""Somebody stole it."" Then I'd see an other kid on the street, and he'd have a bike. What I didn't know was that all the fathers were doing the same thing - the were all using one bicycle. || My grandmother, on the stage, has an abortion! Gives birth to a three-pound Shetland pony! My grandfather is the jockey, comes in third and paid $2.80! || I was the worst bricklayer in the world. I can show you buildings I worked on - they're a hazard. I closed a window one time. I forgot to set back a brick and I just kept going - there I was singing 'There's no business like show business'. || My uncle was the first one in my family to get a telephone. It was like going to the moon. He came running over to tell us, and we were so proud. A telephone! We didn't have to go to the candy store to phone any more. We went around telling everyone. But we didn't hear from my uncle for three days, so my father got worried. He said, ""Let's go over there."" We got there, and my uncle was very depressed. I asked, ""What's the matter?"" He said, ""I got a telephone and nobody called me."" He didn't give his number out - he didn't know that you had to! || I used to ask my father, ""Can we go on vacation?"" He'd say, ""Yeah, on the fire escape."" One day I was out there when it was raining, and I banged on the fire escape. He said, ""I can't hear you, you're on vacation."" Then he'd ask, ""Do you really want to go on vacation? O. K. The Whole family will go, pack your bag."" In those days they had little cowboy bags. I put my shirt in and - we went into the yard. The yard! He said, ""Isn't it wonderful that you are here, in India?"" I looked at my father like he was cracking up. He said, ""It was a wonderful trip on that boat."" I said, ""This isn't India."" He said, ""If I say you're in India, you're in India."" || I knew I loved it because I could take the failures. I was like a professional fighter - they're beat 20 times in a row and they just want that one win."
Paul Reiser,"I'd distract myself until finally it was a combination of things. The show was over and I had time on my hands. I had taken time and played and just relaxed. || A new child in the house is a huge tourist attraction. It's like Disneyland, except there the lines are longer and no one brings casseroles. || The best part of being married is... you don't have to explain a lot of things. Those wordless moments when you both know that what you witnessed together is funny, idiotic, or really sweet. Being connected is pretty miraculous. || There's something that happens in that delivery room, when a woman becomes ten times more a woman, and a guy becomes six times less a man. You feel really dopey and useless and like a spectator. I did, anyway. || The first time I tried to put a new diaper on my baby, I yanked the little Velcro strap too jerkily and actually punched the little guy in the jaw. A real solid shot, too. I knew instinctively that this could not be correct. Unless you're specifically trying to raise a welterweight, continual deliverance of powerful uppercuts is not advised when handling newborns. || This is not the most right I've ever been. || The simple combination of letters and sounds you select as a name for your baby can result in a life of carefree coolness or decades of expensive therapy. ""Hi, I'm Jake"" versus ""Hi, I'm... Tapioca"" || The most challenging part of being a dad is trying to postpone the moment when they realize you don't know anything. I love any sentence that begins with ""Daddy...?"" because it's implied they're looking up to you - that you'll have the answer. The truth is, I don't have any answers.  || We had the boy's name picked out, but we didn't have a girl's. When he turned out to be a boy, we were so relieved. Literally, in the middle of contracting and pushing, and with my wife being drugged - out and half - lucid, we were still coming up with names. || The most rewarding part about being a dad is just looking at children who didn't exist at some point. The first time you saw them, they were the size of a quarter, in a sonogram, and now they can pour orange juice and yell at each other. || My wife and I never agree on the dishtowels. It's a matter of terms. She asks me not to put the dishtowel in the sink. So I drape it over the sink, but not in the sink. If that's our biggest problem, I think we're in good shape. || When you realize you would consider not having a child just so you could take an occasional snooze and be available to see Batman Retires the same weekend it comes out, you have to take a good hard look at yourself and acknowledge, ""I am a shallow, shallow person."" || We have such a long, familiar history with Peter Falk. The minute his mug is on that screen people smile. || We made this movie for $17, and nobody got anything. So it never dawned on me that we would get real people. || The most used appliance in our house is my 10-year-old son Leon's Xbox. || He was born early. But he was born within a safe range of premature. || Having a baby dragged me, kicking and screaming, from the world of self-absorption. || The biggest thing I remember is that there was just no transition. You hit the ground diapering. || Field of Dreams is the only movie - and I saw it in the theater - on an afternoon when I was on location somewhere, and there were like 12 people in the theater. I was just so devastated; I couldn't get out of my seat. And I sat and watched it a second time. || My wife would say my worst habit is that I'm not good at dropping subjects. If something bothers me, I'll bring it up endlessly and relentlessly. I think it's a search for clarity, but she uses different words. || In fact, I had the idea because of Peter Falk. I saw my dad watching a Peter Falk movie and something clicked in my head. I gotta go make a movie for Peter Falk and me. || In the original draft I was 27 and Peter was 55 in the script. That's not the same as a guy in his 40s and a dad in the end of his 70s. It's a different point in both our lives. || And after you've done the acting, there's a lot of places you can put your input - in the editing, in the production of it, in the rewriting of it and so on. || And in that time, I lost my dad and had kids of my own. It was like, OK, I get it now. I know what fatherhood is all about. And you look at your parents differently. || The way I figure, there are two types of people: those who get it and those who don't. If they get it, there's nothing to explain, and if they don't, there's no point in trying to explain. They don't get it. Move on. || But at the same time that the experience is pulling you apart, it's also bonding you. You have this joint venture! You both made this baby. And that's the thing I still can't get over. || Every time I see Peter Falk in the movie I think that would be great. We'd be fun together. || But you get past that and realize you have to let go of what you think you want. There'll be plenty of time for that later. Right now, go and be with that baby. Just play with this beautiful little boy. || New parents always sound like hucksters in a pyramid scheme. Anyone who has kids and then gets you to go and have kids gets a check from Huckster Headquarters. || It's not like some movies where you're following a bunch of different stories you can cut around. There was nowhere to cut to. It's these guys. We're not cutting back to anybody else. || Nothing would make me happier if Peter Falk would finally win his Oscar for this. Not just as the writer but as a fan and a friend. It would be so great. || I love coffee. I don’t drink coffee but I love it. I drink tea and I don’t like it. Let me say something about tea. Tea starts out bad and never gets better. You put in honey, cream, sugar, lemon and you still go ""Ooh that’s bad!"" And the people who make tea know it’s bad. That’s why they give you so many choices. You go into a store and there’s a thousand types of teas. Every herb fruit and spice in every combination. They’re desperate to make this stuff palatable and it almost works. You think, ""Wow! Look at this! Apple, cinnamon, mango cherry tea. This should be great. I like all those things... This is going to be just great."" You take a sip and go ""Nope That’s still very bad."" || But I really felt that, something about the lights going down, and the sense of community. I saw this movie at one festival, and there were 1700 people. || I'd never directed before and this movie's too important to me to put in the hands of some guy who has never directed. Even if it's me. || I've come to realize that making it your life's work to be different than your parents is not only hard to do, it's a dumb idea. Not everything we found fault with was necessarily wrong; we were right, for example, to resent, as kids, being told when to go to bed. We'd be equally wrong, as parents, to let our kids stay up all night. To throw out all the tools of parenting just because our parents used them would be like making yourself speak English without using ten letters of the alphabet; it's hard to do. || We all hold on to some image of the family we want, based one way or another on the family we had. Lots of people are thrilled about the families they came from, others couldn't get away fast enough. Most people fall into that vast middle ground: great affection mixed with a few ideas for improvement. A couple of things they wish could have perhaps been done differently. || They don't see that whole pattern. Worm/death. Worm/death. I would catch on.  || You know, the fact that every morning you get a script in your mailbox, that's going to stop. All these little pedestrian, mundane things. And the cash. || I'm feeling very vindicated that, when I see the audiences laughing and being moved, we were right. || Peanut butter and lamb chops were not foods that had ever been a significant part of our life before pregnancy. In fact, my wife almost never ate either.So where did these craving come from? I concluded it's the baby, ordering in. || The jewel in the baby product crown is the stroller. And if in America you are what you drive, then in Parentland, you are what you push. || Parents often give middle names just so that later, when they're yelling at the kid, they can drag it out. ""Henry David Thoreau, you come in here this instant!"" || The consumer mentality - we like something, what other flavor does it come in? We like that TV show, does it come in a book form? Does it come in a capsule? How about a soup? || I was just following the corporate manifest, but at the premiere my sister punched me in the stomach. I thought, 'This doesn't bode well for the public.' || Marriage is just an elaborate game that allows two selfish people to periodically feel that they're not. || I used to walk into a party and scan the room for attractive women. Now I look for women to hold my baby so I can eat potato salad sitting down. || It felt very natural right off the bat. It was really tailor-made for him and mine was tailor-made for me, so it was easy to jump into. || I was visiting my parents, and I walked into a room where my father was watching a Peter Falk movie on TV... I think it was 'The Cheap Detective.' Anyway, my father was belly-laughing, and he never really did that. I thought, 'If Peter Falk can make my dad laugh, then I'm going to come up with a movie in which Peter Falk plays my father.' || By shrewdly linking procreation to an act likely to make you stupid with excitement, God has seen to it that Life does indeed go on. It's possible, by the way, that this is why God's name comes up so often in the middle of the act; it's a salute to the author: ""Hey, whoever made this up - thanks."" || There was a period where our child's birth was getting really close, and we still had nothing. We were dangerously close to calling him Untitled Baby Project. || Any issues my parents went through are very prominent in the movie, even though they enjoyed a happy relationship. The story actually started for me when my mom told me a few years ago that because she got a job, she never made it to the World's Fair in New York, and that's a missed opportunity that always stayed with her. || It is not important to know what facts are true. The relationships portrayed are real. My mother did have a job interview with my father. She worked alongside him for awhile, they dated, were married and had a family. She never did get to the World's Fair. || A friend told me to listen to my heart. Another friend told me to listen to my gut. Maybe I need an autopsy, because right now my colon is kind of iffy. || As you get older you realize your parents don't look so dumb - and that you're not as smart as you thought you were. || Middle names are kind of like vice presidents: It's a fine distinction and certainly an honor, but you're never not aware that someone else got the real job. || People come up to us and ask how we knew so much about their own family... I'm talking about people from faraway places, too. I get people from Turkey and Chile coming up to me and saying I wrote about their family. || Once in a while you get a moment of clarity - an inspiration - and they don't come that frequently. || So we’re on this plane, and across the aisle from us was another couple, about our age, traveling with their two children - a two-year-old girl and a very new boy who, though tiny in stature, had a crying scream so piercing, it was annoying people on other planes. || If a tree falls on your head in a forest and no one hears it, it still hurts. || You don't have to have 14 committees and studios weighing in. Its really just you. || There's something very refreshing about being on stage. || I'm not smart enough to write about something that didn't actually happen to me. But I couldn't write a space movie if you put a gun to my head. || I remember my wife and I used to get on plane and see everybody else with their babies. They'd be putting strollers and car seats up above, and we'd think: Oh, please Lord, don't make us go through that. || Not only do I sing to him, I sing entire conversations. You become Jerry Lewis. || She kind of reminds one of Helen. There's something very similar about Elizabeth Perkins. || Get a good dog. We have not picked up food in the kitchen in 15 years. || Upstate New York in the middle of October. You can't get more beautiful than that. || I always loved comedy, but I never knew it was something you could learn to do. I always thought that some people are born comedians, just like some people are born dentists. || But the two of them together, broke my heart. Olympia and Peter, those scenes... When they're kissing in their 20s and then kissing in their 70s, that's what it is. And they had never met five minutes before they shot those scenes. || It felt like such a right idea that it didn't bother me to put it away, because I knew it would be ready when it's ready. When I had kids, I realized I understood my parents better. I had more compassion for them and I look at my kids and realize, 'Oh, man. This is just the same cycle all over again.' || If the powers that be see there is a bigger market out there, it will make it easier for the next time around. || Babies awaken slightly disoriented, with a look that's half Angel and half Lost Tourist. || When people talk about wanting to ""have children someday,"" what they really mean is that they want babies. Nobody wants an angry adolescent. Nobody wants an obnoxious seven-year-old trying to wear out dirty words they just learned in school that day. What they really want is cute, adorable babies who love you and need you. The bad stuff is just the price you agree to pay for having the good stuff. || They're not the sharpest people - babies. So, you must be everything to them. || Younger kids, they understand that things aren't so perfect with their father or with their mother. || When my son said, ""I can't stop thinking about girls,"" I said, ""That's not gonna stop. Congratulations. You're in the club. From now until the day you die, one way or another you'll be thinking about girls."" || Over the years, there certainly have been plenty of ideas that I've had and given up on, but for this one, the only thing that was standing in its way was me doing it - I just had to write it... And then if it didn't happen, it didn't happen. But I didn't want it to be for lack of effort on my part, so I had hunch that it would be a good story and that we would work well together. And it certainly worked out that way. || Three has always been tougher than Two. Think of any of your famous threesomes. The Three Stooges? Look at the anger there. My bet is that before Curly was born, Moe and Larry could play together for hours without even a single poke in the eye. Huey, Dewey, and Louie? Donald Duck never had a moment's peace. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly? I rest my case. || Our date-nightrule is no talking about the kids. That lasts about to the end of the driveway.  || From the minute we're born, boys and girls stare at each other, trying to figure out if they like what they see. Like parade lines, passing each other for mutual inspection. You march, you look. You march, you look. If you're interested, you stop and talk, and if it doesn't work out, you just get back in the parade. You keep marching, and you keep looking. || My parenting style could be described as not ""good cop"" or ""bad cop"" so much as ""nervous cop."" I'm always yelling for somebody to stop because they're about to get hurt. I'm the ""take a jacket,"" ""slow down"" guy."
Paul Rodriguez,"Those are adult magazines. Anybody can own them. It doesn't prove the charge. || Sometimes I think war is God's way of teaching us geography. || Everybody really needs to laugh... If you don't laugh, you're not going to live long. || Maybe he's my good luck charm. || What’s wrong about eating cows? What do you think god made them for? Their big, their stupid, their delicious. You want more reasons? I never met an animal more prepared to die than a cow. Next time you go to the farm look at a cow in the eyes, it is begging you for a bullet. || Hunting is not a sport. In a sport, both sides should know they're in the game. || It's like a dream coming true. So when you actually accomplish it, you almost don't know how to react. You imagined you'd run up and down the street screaming, but you're just stunned instead. Like, 'Is this real?' || It is my belief that Latinos in show business have to be self sufficient and creative while aggressively attempting to penetrate post-mogul Hollywood. Self- starting is becoming the path to serious studio support. || Latinos are black, white, brown, beige. What does that say about our ancestors? We'll sleep with anybody! || Animals don't have anyone to protect them. If we don't stand up, the people who are harming animals will never get stopped. || Life isn’t like a box of chocolates. It’s more like a jar of jalapenos. What you do today, might burn your butt tomorrow."
Paula Poundstone,"How do you come back? It's one step at a time. I'm optimistic because I don't know what else to be. || I have jokes I've told before and will tell again, but my favorite part of the night is talking to the crowd. || I'm thankful that my memory is good because my vision is going. || I'll probably never have children because I don't believe in touching people for any reason. || There are those wonderful moments of clarity in life when one is reminded how irreparably flawed we humans are. Once, when I was nineteen, on the subway in Boston I lost my balance slightly and bumped into an elderly woman. I quickly apologized and she replied, ""Well, hold on to something, stupid."" There it is. That's it. That's it in a nutshell. I don't want to sound negative, but I think every fetus should be shown a film of that incident, maybe projected up on the uterine wall, and then asked if it wants to come out. I am a strong believer in a woman's right to choose, but I also think that in the last trimester, the kid should be given every opportunity to back out. || They're not going to teach science at all. What they do is take the science students down to the lake, tie them in burlap sacks, and throw them in. If God thinks they're good science students, they float. || My act is sort of improvisational. I have a skeleton in my head, but no fat or skin on it. || There is no course of life so weak and sottish as that which is managed by order, method, and discipline. || There are really only so many foods and so many ways you can prepare them. || When I sat down to write I just felt like a geek writing about myself. And then it dawned on me, just because of the way I am, I can't stop talking, and part of the problem is that anything that gets said reminds me of something that happened to me one time, and invariably I cut people off and talk about myself. || I was the youngest in my family. When the other kids went to school, my mother would make them breakfast and then she would go back to bed for an hour, so I was sort of babysat by television. || Inside there are three pouches of two. This is what happens to me: I open the first pouch, and I eat one tart, and I enjoy it very much, as naturally I would. And then I feel, Well, I have to eat the second one or it will go stale. Well, now I’ve eaten two, and it’s no longer just a snack, it’s a meal. I figure I may as well eat two more. And then finally I’m just like, Well hell, I don’t just want two pop tarts hangin’ out in a box. I eat the last two just to tidy up, really. || I checked in to a hotel the other day and the woman behind the corner said to me, “Do you have a floor preference?” I go, “Yeah, I would like a floor.” Apparently, they can just suspend you from the ceiling now. || I only do two things in my life, and that's take care of my kids and work. Fortunately, these are my favorite things to do, so it works out. || I'm the only person I know of who's ever been pulled over for attempted speeding. || The pleasure of the mulch pile is incomprehensible. I wouldn't care if they just hauled the mulch to the landfill somewhere. Obviously, grass clippings are biodegradable, but when they're bunched together at the landfill, they become badly influenced by other garbage. || If only someone would do for cows what Bambi did for deer. Cows have been in films, but they haven't starred. I'm still willing to eat a species that is only a supporting player. || I've always thought that if my death was imminent, I would read. When I can't focus on a book, I tend to keep reading the same page. My guess is, I would've read, like the first page of Nicholas Nickleby over and over again. || I used to use Shopping for a Better World by the Council on Economic Priorities for my responsible consumer needs. It rates companies with an A, C, or F on their environmental impact, their record on hiring women and minorities, and their willingness to disclose that information to the public. So, for example, there's Chevron with an F in the environment category but a B under minorities and an A under the disclosure heading. It seems to me that if a company is destroying the earth, the fact that they're including minorities in their pillaging and are willing to tell us they're doing it should be little comfort. It's like forgiving an ax murderer who is nice to children. || I have short-term memory loss, though I like to think of it as Presidential eligibility. || The mistakes that I made I made because I drank too much. I don't think that's going to happen any more. Am I going to make mistakes as a parent? Sadly, every day. I'm looking around for the perfect parent and I haven't seen one yet. || I mean, I do love clever and witty, but I think that the 'Three Stooges' were geniuses. They'd have to be for their appeal to have lasted this long. || I'm really more prolific than most stand-ups. My act changes. I do fold in new experiences, new observations, whatever you want to call it. || I have a horrible memory and I used to consider that a liability, but I've learned along the way that talking to people is really a beautiful thing. || I get the first flight out from anywhere I am because I have to come home to my kids. || I don't need a holiday or a feast to feel grateful for my children, the sun, the moon, the roof over my head, music, and laughter, but I like to take this time to take the path of thanks less traveled. || I did auditions at a club called the Comedy Connection. They wanted nothing to do with me. But one night they were doing a night of all women comics, and they invited me to do that. || I also like a great Caesar salad with anchovies, although I don't know why some places say 'with anchovies.' If you're making a proper Caesar salad, it's going to have anchovies. || I don't have a bank account because I don't know my mother's maiden name and apparently that's the key to the whole thing right there. I go in every few weeks and guess. || I'm thankful for the three ounce Ziploc bag, so that I have somewhere to put my savings. || Adults are always asking kids what they want to be when they grow up because they are looking for ideas. || I was diagnosed a number of years ago with obsessive-compulsive disorder - which everyone has, to some degree - and I have this really annoying trait where in conversation, I always steer it back to something that happened to me. || My Mom said she learned how to swim when someone took her out in the lake and threw her off the boat. I said, 'Mom, they weren't trying to teach you how to swim.' || I have a very silly sense of humor. I've never laughed harder in my entire life than seeing someone with toilet paper stuck on the bottom of their shoe. || When every high school graduate can spell the word, 'inauguration,' let's put lampshades on our heads and listen to his speeches until Obama's voice gives out. || I got my dog three years ago because I was drunk in a pet store. We had nine cats at the time. The cats started hiding the alcohol after that. || I'm thankful for Sarah Palin's vice presidential bid, which taught us that Alaska is not in a box off the coast of California. || I think that's why they have so many religious freaks in the airports, they even keep the flowers behind the counter 'Go, go my children... be fruitful and annoy.' || Inside the Pop-Tarts Box there are three pouches of two. This is what happens to me: I open the first pouch, and I eat one tart, and I enjoy it very much, as naturally I would. And then I feel, “Well, I have to eat the second one or it will go stale.” Well, now I’ve eaten two, and it’s no longer just a snack, it’s a meal. I figure I may as well eat two more. And then finally I’m just like, “Well hell, I don’t just want two pop tarts hangin’ out in a box.” I eat the last two just to tidy up, really. || We need a twelve-step group for compulsive talkers; they could call it Anon Anon. || It's funny that we think of libraries as quiet demure places where we are shushed by dusty, bun-balancing, bespectacled women. The truth is libraries are raucous clubhouses for free speech, controversy and community. Librarians have stood up to the Patriot Act, sat down with noisy toddlers and reached out to illiterate adults. Libraries can never be shushed. || President Obama could keep a big map with push pins on it to keep track of how many countries hate us, and when we get down to only half, let's have a ball. I'll blow up the balloons myself. || Once I was gone for a month and I was just miserable, so I flew back from Florida for two hours just to be home and see my cats. || I was born in Alabama, but I only lived there for a month before I'd done everything there was to do. || I talk to a lot of librarians, and there's always a steady drumbeat of how libraries are places of community. But a lot of them have also recently - and just in the nick of time - refurbished, because during this economic downturn, people have a tendency to borrow instead of buy. || I can make things, but I don't cook them, exactly. Like salmon, I can stick that in a pan. Or the other day I made noodles, but they were hard. It never occurred to me to check them; I just stopped cooking them when I felt they were ready. Really, I'm too absentminded. || My mom is one of those really angry moms who gets mad at absolutely everything. Once when I was a little kid, I accidentally knocked a Flintstones glass off the kitchen table. She said, ‘Well, dammit, we can’t have nice things.’ || Hell yeah, I still wear zoot suits on stage!!! I don’t care that they went out of style in the 30s and that I went out of style in the 80s. Look at it like this: You know how Gallagher smashes watermelons and Larry the Cable Guy says ‘Get Er Done’ and Bill Hicks deconstructs society and enlightens people with the truth in a deeply hilarious way? Well, I wear horrendous looking outfits on stage. That’s my thing. And, dare I say, it’s worked out pretty damn well for me. Everybody in the world used to know who I was twenty five years ago. And that’s due in large part to the dalmatian neckties and the piano key neckties I would wear. Neck wear actually made me a legend! How many people can say that or would even want to say that? Not many. Tucker Carlson, maybe… || Gay Republicans, how exactly does that work? 'We disapprove of our own lifestyle. We beat ourselves up in parking lots.' || It is my wish to die of unique causes, perhaps in a high-speed tricycle crash, a bizarre stapling incident, or as a result of inadvertently sucking my brains out through my ear while trying to untwist the vacuum hose. || What moron said that knowledge is power? Knowledge is power only if it doesn't depress you so much that it leaves you in an immobile heap at the end of your bed. || The wages of sin are death, but by the time taxes are taken out, it's just sort of a tired feeling. || Speaking of happy successes, after years of struggling to lose those few extra pounds every mother puts on during adoption, particularly when the doctor orders bed rest, in 2004 I sent my assistant to the Gap in dark glasses with a fake ID to purchase my first pair of ""Easy Fit"" jeans. || Remember when you were considered an environmentalist when you didn't throw junk out the car window? I sure do miss that simpler, happier time. || I've decided that perhaps I'm bulimic and just keep forgetting to purge. || The problem with cats is that they get the exact same look on their face whether they see a moth or an axe-murderer. || I was one of the first people to almost actually vomit over hearing the use of the phrase ""family values"" and I pride myself on never having fallen for the idea that Barbara Bush was sweet and grandmotherly. I met Barbara Bush and, as I expected, she was a tank with eyes, not a nice person at all and why should that blow anybody away? || Can you remember when you didn't want to sleep? Isn't it inconceivable? I guess the definition of adulthood is that you want to sleep. || It is the best part of the night. The classic interactive lines are 'Where are you from? What do you do for a living?' I almost always get something interesting. || The position of First Lady has no rules, just precedent, so its evolution has been at a virtual standstill for years. If Martha Washington didn't do it, then no one is sure it should be done. || When we live up to our Constitution, let's form a Conga line around the Capitol and bungee jump off the dome. || I love key lime pie, although it's never made the proper way. || The law must be stable, but it must not stand still. || I made mistakes and I broke the law and I'm more than willing to pay a price for that. But there's a price beyond that that my children have paid, and that's not what was supposed to happen. || I love talking to the audience, and I must be the luckiest performer in the world. I always land something or somebody that just takes off. || I don’t believe for a second that weightlifting is a sport. They pick up a heavy thing and put it down again. To me, that’s indecision. || When we save the rain forest, the polar bear, and Al Gore, we should party so hard that Canada calls the cops on us for noise. || I was court-ordered to Alcoholics Anonymous on television. Pretty much blows the hell out of the second A, wouldn't you say? || I used to watch 'The Waltons' and sob because my family was nothing like that. We had a cruel sense of humor in my family. || I like to work on New Year's Eve. It has a nice spirit; a nice feel about it. If you are all about the 'year-end' thing at all, then laughing with fellow human beings is a great way to start the new year."
Phyllis Diller,"My father used to call me the laughing hyena. || You want to look younger... rent smaller children. || I’ll never forget my first fur. It was a modest little stole. Modest? People thought I was wearing anchovies. || We had a civil ceremony – his mother couldn’t come. || You think I'm overdressed? This is just my slip. || Fang says he eats a lot to settle his nerves. I said, ""Have you seen where they’re settling?"" || Actually, I comb my hair quite often. Of course, I use an electric toothbrush. || For Fang, getting out of bed in the morning is a career move. || I became a stand-up comedienne because I had a sit-down husband. || Just the other day I said to Fang, ""Don't you think we've got a storybook romance?"" and he said, ""Yes, and every page is ripped."" || Would you believe I once entered a beauty contest? I not only came in last, I got 361 get well cards. || I will never give up. I am in my 14th year of a 10-day beauty plan. || When I go to bed, I've got so much grease on my body, I wear snow chains to hold up my gown. || One night I asked Fang to kiss me goodnight. He got up and put on his work clothes. || I once baked a rum cake that gave Fang a hangover. || I got my first laugh when my mother entered me in a baby contest. || When I was a kid and we used to play Post Office, I was the Dead Letter Office. || I joined an astrology club and every week we meet and discuss the stars. This week we're discussing Paul Newman. || My sister-in-law is so skinny that she has a striped dress with only one stripe. || Fang is so dumb. When he won his letter for high school the coach had to read it to him. || Fang said if they had used my figure for the hourglass, the day would be very short. || My mother-in-law buys her coats in a carper shop. She wears a 9x12. || Fang came home loaded one night, went into the closet and said: ""Third floor, please."" || He has so many muscles he has to make an appointment to move his fingers. || Health - what my friends are always drinking to before they fall down. || Remember, only a policeman is allowed to express himself on an expressway. || When I go to bed at night, I've got so much grease on my body I wear snow chains to hold up my nightgown. || I was sort of tricked into marrying. One night I was out with Fang and a girl said, “You better hand on to him.” I thought I had a prize. I didn’t know she meant that after one drink he falls down. || Before you get married you should meet your fiance’s parents. It is not enough that you like his parole officer. || I have so many liver spots, I ought to come with a side of onions. || 'Fang' is permanent in my act of course. Don't confuse him with my real husbands. They are temporary. || When I told Fang I was going to have my face lifted, he said, 'Who'd steal it?' || Nothing was happening in the bedroom. I nicknamed our waterbed the Dead Sea. || I met my husband when a friend sent him over to my house to cure my hiccoughs. || I still take the pill because I don't want any more grandchildren. || I realized on our first wedding anniversary that our marriage was in trouble. Fang gave me luggage. It was packed. || My timing is so precise a heckler would have to make an appointment just to get a word in. || A passport picture is a photo of a man that he can laugh at without realizing that it looks exactly the way his friends see him. || A stand-up comic is judged by every line. Singers get applause at the end of their song no matter how bad they are. || I don't know how you feel about old age... but in my case I didn't even see it coming. It hit me from the rear. || Like all good ruins, I look better by moonlight. || Your husband is lazy if when he leaves the house, he finds out which way the wind is blowing and goes that direction. || My eight-year-old bought a bicycle with the money he saved by not smoking. || They just elected me Mis Phonograph Record of 1966. They discovered my measurements were 33 1/2, 45, 78! || I was born at home on newspapers. I still have a story on my butt, although now the print is much larger. || I'm from such an old family, it's been condemned. || When I go to the beach, even the tide won’t come in. || The last thing my kids ever did to earn money was lose their baby teeth. || Most people get an appointment at a beauty parlor... I was committed! || It’s hard to find a negligee in my size. I wear a Junior Mister. || It’s an ill will that blows when you leave the hairdresser. || I’m the only woman who can walk in Central Park at night... And reduce the crime rate. || Keep at least one window pane clean to check the weather. Once when I didn't do this I sent the kids off with umbrellas for six weeks straight. || Never refer to your wedding night as the original amateur hour. || No matter what time your guests arrive, pretend they're early, so naturally you're not ready. || Right from the start my parents had left me to fend for myself. Apparently unaware that I was a kid, they invariably treated me like an adult, perhaps because they themselves were no spring chickens. || Tranquilizers work only if you follow the advice on the bottle - keep away from children. || What I don't like about office Christmas parties is looking for a job the next day. || I buried a lot of my ironing in the back yard. || There's so little money in my bank account, my scenic checks show a ghetto. || My photographs don't do me justice - they just look like me. || Old age is when the liver spots show through your gloves. || Our dog died from licking our wedding picture. || The last thing I'd learn, well into my career, was how to get on, how to say hello, how to get in with the audience. || Just because I have rice on my clothes doesn't mean I've been to a wedding. A Chinese man threw up on me. || Fang drops so much food on his ties we keep them in the refrigerator. || Fang took the entire family out for coffee and donuts the other night. The kids enjoyed it. It was the first time they’d ever given blood. || I spent seven hours in a beauty shop... and that was for the estimate. || The only parts left of my original body are my elbows. || I once wore a peekaboo blouse. People would peek and then they'd boo. || My vanity table is a Black & Decker workbench. || I love to go to the doctor. Where else would a man look at me and say 'Take off your clothes'? || In most states you can get a driver's license when you're sixteen years old, which made a lot of sense to me when I was sixteen years old but now seems insane. || He was in the air most of the time. On the air, in the air, one way or the other. It was his thing and this was his airport. || Your husband is lazy if coffee doesn’t keep him awake – even when it’s hot and being spilled on him. || Some wives have model husbands, I got one that needed remodeling. || When you hire a person to plan your wedding, this does not include securing the groom. Plan to get married on Friday the 13th. In years to come this will make it much easier to explain why things turned out badly. To look beautiful at your wedding, take time to plan it. It took me a long time to find two ugly bridesmaids and a frumpy little flower girl. || My body's in such bad shape I wear prescription underwear. || Fang's breath is so bad the dentist works on him through his ears. || I found a great new weed killer, but it stains the carpet. || Fang will not go on a picnic. He says we have the whole thing at home: bugs, dirt, tainted food. At our last picnic we wanted to play horseshoes, but his mother refused to go barefoot. || If Fang had a brain operations, it would be minor surgery. || The only way I can get Fang out of bed in the morning is to wear a black dress and a veil, and sit on the edge of his bed and cry. || My husband, Fang, is so dumb I once said, ""There’s a dead bird."" He looked up. || You know you're old if your walker has an airbag. || Most children threaten at times to run away from home. This is the only thing that keeps some parents going. || My cooking is so bad my kids thought Thanksgiving was to commemorate Pearl Harbor. || A bachelor is a guy who never made the same mistake once. || I'm eighteen years behind in my ironing. || Best way to get rid of kitchen odors: Eat out. || I want my children to have all the things I couldn't afford. Then I want to move in with them. || What I don't like about office Christmas parties is looking for a job the next day. || It's a good thing that beauty is only skin deep, or I'd be rotten to the core. || Money's scarce, Times are hard, Here's your fucking Xmas card. || If your children write their names in the dust on the furniture, don't let them put the year. || My house used to be haunted, but the ghosts haven't been back since the night I tried on all my wigs. || Fang is such a drag. He took his suit to the cleaners to be cleaned and depressed. || A smile is a curve that sets everything straight. || Cleaning your house while your kids are still growing up is like shoveling the walk before it stops snowing. || My mother-in-law had a pain beneath her left breast. Turned out to be a trick knee. || I've been asked to say a couple of words about my husband, Fang. How about short and cheap? || You know you're old if they have discontinued your blood type. || Christmas is a time when everybody wants his past forgotten and his present remembered. || Fang can’t stand to see trash and garbage lying around the house. He can’t stand the competition. || This woman was so cross-eyed. She can go to a tennis match and never move her head. || I never made 'Who's Who,' but I'm featured in 'What's That?' || Remember there is no way you can give the father custody of the children without getting a divorce. || I realize it is normal to argue. I almost missed World War II watching my parents fight. || I finally had a ship tattooed to my chest. I wanted something on it. || My idea of exercise is a good brisk sit down. || I admit, I have a tremendous sex drive. My boyfriend lives forty miles away. || If your house is really a mess and a stranger comes to the door greet him with, ""Who could have done this? We have no enemies."" || The best contraceptive for old people is nudity. || My recipe for dealing with anger and frustration: set the kitchen timer for twenty minutes, cry, rant, and rave, and at the sound of the bell, simmer down and go about business as usual. || It would seem that something which means poverty, disorder, and violence every single day should be avoided entirely, but the desire to beget children is a natural urge. || The doctor looked my body over. I said: ""Is there any hope?"" He said: ""Yes. Reincarnation."" || I have nothing against dogs. I just hate rugs that go squish-squish. || If it weren't for baseball, many kids wouldn't know what a millionaire looked like. || The only time I ever enjoyed ironing was the day I accidentally got gin in the steam iron. || We spend the first twelve months of our children's lives teaching them to walk and talk and the next twelve telling them to sit down and shut up. || Always be nice to your children because they are the ones who will choose your rest home. || Never go to bed mad. Stay up and fight. || Today my alphabet soup spelled ""UGH."" || Whatever you may look like, marry a man your own age - as your beauty fades, so will his eyesight. || Some bad things have been happening to me. A pervert called me. Five times. Collect. And that damn fool won't tell me where he lives. And my fan club broke up today. The guy died. || I went into a lingerie department one day and I said to the lady, 'I'd like to see something in a bra,' and she said, 'I bet you would!' || I asked the waiter, 'Is this milk fresh?' He said, 'Lady, three hours ago it was grass.' || Women want men, careers, money, children, friends, luxury, comfort, independence, freedom, respect, love, and three dollar pantyhose that won't run. || I was the world's ugliest baby. When I was born, the doctor slapped everybody. || I’m at an age when my back goes out more than I do. || The only thing domestic about me is I was born in this country. || I asked my hairdresser what would look good on me. She says a Los Angeles Rams football helmet. || My husband always felt that a marriage and career don’t mix. That’s why he’s never worked. || Aim high, and you won't shoot your foot off. || It's a certain kind of immortality, because those Disney films do go on and on and on. || Housework can't kill you, but why take a chance? || Think of me as a sex symbol for men who just don't give a damn. || I got a figure that just won't start. || The romance is dead if he drinks champagne from your slipper and chokes on a Dr. Scholl’s foot pad. || Do not taste food while you’re cooking... you may lose your nerve to eat it. || I’ve turned many a head in my day... and a few stomachs. || Burt Reynolds once asked me out. I was in his room. || His finest hour lasted a minute and a half. || I wanted to become me, totally me. The more me, the better. I instinctively knew this and I was right. || The real reason your pro tells you to keep your head down is so you can't see him laughing at you. || You know you're old when someone compliments you on your alligator shoes, and you're barefoot. || My husband is so useless that it’s hard for me to be romantic with him. I get down on the floor and say, ""If you love me, blink your eyes."" || When I go to the dentist, he's the one that has to have the anesthetic. || The only time I ever enjoyed ironing was the day I accidentally got gin in the steam iron. || Maybe it's true that life begins at fifty. But everything else starts to wear out, fall out, or spread out. || My mother-in-law must be the probation officer I got for the crime I committed of marrying my husband. || If I wore a peek-a-boo dress, it would be like turning in a false alarm. || Fang had a terrible accident. He found a job. || Do I believe in Witchcraft? I'm the result of it. || My horoscope was so depressing today, it included a list of poisons. || Have the man at the station put the air in the tires. I did it once myself. Have you ever seen a car with a limp? || When I go to the beauty parlor, I always use the emergency entrance. || Carry an oar when you drive. Three times I’ve ended up in water. || Your husband is lazy if the directions on his medicine say, “A teaspoon before going to bed,” and in one day he uses seven bottles. || You can say the nastiest things about yourself without offending anyone. || We Californians are constantly accused of not having seasons, but we do. We have fire, flood, mud, and drought. || There’s such a buildup of crud in my oven, there’s only room to bake a single cupcake. || It’s true Fang and I fight, but we’ve never gone to bed mad. Of course, one year we were up for three months. || I’m beginning to have morning sickness. I’m not having a baby, I’m just sick of morning. || If it weren’t for my adam’s apple, I’d have no shape at all. || I should have suspected my husband was lazy. On our wedding day, his mother told me: ""I’m not losing a son; I’m gaining a couch."" || I hate smart sales clerks. I said to one, ""What do you have in lingerie?"" She says, ""More than you’ll ever have!"" || Fang and I are always fighting. When we get up in the morning, we don’t kiss; we touch gloves. || My own laugh is the real thing and I've had it all my life. || Your husband drinks too much if he says he never drinks alone, but considers the goldfish somebody. || Feminism is doomed to failure because it is based on an attempt to repeal and restructure human nature. || By far the most common craving of pregnant women is not to be pregnant. || There's a new medical crisis. Doctors are reporting that many men are having allergic reactions to latex condoms. They say they cause severe swelling. So what's the problem? || The reason women don't play football is because 11 of them would never wear the same outfit in public."
Ray Romano,"I wasn’t really that informed about the two-year-old. Oh, I'd read about them, and occasionally I’d see documentaries on the Discovery Channel showing two-year-olds in the wild, where they belong. || The comics that are just conversing with you up there and drawing on their own life, yeah, I guess so. I guess some do political humor, some do topical humor, but the ones that I like, the ones that are appealing to me, were guys who were just talking to you about their life. || I've since converted to a different sect of Catholicism - part-time Catholicism. || If we did a reunion show we should do it now and show it in 10 years just so everybody still looks good. || ""Eulogy"" which is the independent film I did this Spring is being screened this week, but I'm just part of a large ensemble cast, so they can't blame me totally if it tanks. || I'd rather be in Las Vegas 104 degrees than New York 90 degrees, you know why? Legalized prostitution. In any weather that takes the edge off. || In a way, comedy is like sex. The more noise you hear, the better you think you're doing. || It is our swan song, and winning kind of symbolizes the closure at the end, and I miss it already. I'm gonna go bawl now. || That’s when you know you’re a true married couple: when you have to apologize for what you did in her dream. || I wanted to do something different, but it`s a weird transition you`re making here. You`re trying to get the audience to come with you. || When you wake up one day and say, “You know what? I don’t think I ever need to sleep or have sex again.” Congratulations, you're ready to have children. || Every parent knows that for a kid, the car is chloroform. || Parents, just keep in mind that kids will always round off to the nearest obscenity. || We want to recognize that it is the end of the show without really saying it. But we'll satisfy the audience's desire for a little heart. || The first time I played golf was in Flushing Meadows, Queens, when I was about 16 or 17. They had an 18-hole pitch-and-putt. My buddies and I would hop the fence and sneak on and play. || I love hitting into the rough because it gets me close to the people. || I'll be spending the holidays with my family. Nothing special, just some light bickering and biting sarcasm. || It's starting to feel good, although I don't like feeling too good - that's not where my comedy comes from. || The fact that they let me in a movie with Gene Hackman has left me with no faith in show buisness. || If a guy’s ever telling you a four-hour sex story with a straight face, just feel sorry for him. Not for lying to you, but for lying to himself. As a matter of fact, stop him right in the middle of the story and just hug him. Nine times out of ten he’ll just break down and cry. He knows you know. || We've written the stories as they've happened in our lives, and they have happened in our lives, and people seem to identify with them. And as scary as that sounds, people seem themselves in us. || I came from an Italian house. The refrigerator was always full. I never knew you had to buy food. I thought there were food fairies that came at night. || I do what I do because I love it. || I don't think men talk as much as women, but when we have something on our minds we'll get it out. || My wife said to me 'I hope you win... but if you do and you go up and say you love me, don't think it makes up for never saying it when we're alone.' || My wife gets all the money I make. I just get an apple and clean clothes every morning. || I have this mistress: show business. || I have the show because I'm insecure. It's my insecurity that makes me want to be a comic, that makes me need the audience. || I feel very privileged that I am able to do something. All of us saw the images on TV and we said we can send money but we still wanted to contribute more. || I would do a nude scene, sure, if they ever made the movie ""Flat Ass Comes to Town!"" || I love hitting into the rough because it gets me close to the people. || If I'm really considering doing film from now on then that is the smart thing to do, or you can go either way. You can just do the same character over and over again and make a different comedy like over and over again. || You don't want to shock them and do something totally opposite, but you also want to play a different character. || We're good friends, but we hate each other. Last year, Kevin made the cut and I didn't. My show is over. Kevin's got a really big movie coming out. What else do I got? || I am like Hugh Hefner minus anything good about his life. || You know, a TV show is a slow build. || People are going to see both of us and think it`s an Abbott and Costello kind of thing. It`s not an easy switch. It`s not an easy transition from TV to film. || He missed a shot and got frustrated and accidentally hit himself on the head with his own putter and needed stitches on the course. It was hysterical. He continued playing. He didn't get hurt. It wasn't serious. || Mike Royce and I have always had success writing what we know. What we know now is that we're middle-aged, neurotic and fat. || In school, I wasn't a very good student - I was very irresponsible and never did the studying but always liked to get the laugh. || I still got my hair, I'm not fat. || I still feel like an immature idiot inside, but I look in the mirror and - as a friend of mine once said- this old guy keeps getting in the way. || I lived at home till I was 29. || I do know its important to keep the romantic spark alive in your marriage. But with four kids, sometimes it’s enough just to keep yourself alive. || I don't get sick. || I can't complain about my career, that's for sure. || You have to remember: the wife been home all day cleaning asses and feeding faces. Sometimes the opposite. || I like doing film, you know, single-camera. || Everyone should have kids. They are the greatest joy in the world. But they are also terrorists. You'll realize this as soon as they're born, and they start using sleep deprivation to break you. || I just don't want to play the same guy again over and over. || I feel like this is a dream - and I apologize for how I dressed some of you. || I don't want to say work is who I am, but some people feel more centered and more whole when they're producing and creating. || I don't want to be a spokesman for family values, but that's the way my standup is perceived. || I do still get intimidated by certain things. || Each day it's like: 'How many more days am I going to feel young and vibrant? I feel young and vibrant now, but I also feel the aches and pains a little bit.' || My wife gets so jealous. She came home from work and was mad at me because there was a pretty girl on the bus she thought I would have liked. || My daughter’s tricycle said “Some Assembly Required.” It came in a jar. || Nothing like a little chest pain to restore your faith. || This year, I will hug my wife more. Or have my assistant hug her more for me. || Why can't I love him (a 2 yr old nephew) from afar? That’s how I want to love him – through pictures and folklore. || Without identical twins, you’ll never get to experience entering a hotel room with one of them and watching him run into the full-length mirror because he though he saw his brother. || After 'Raymond,' there was this big feeling of, 'What do I do next?' || You don't want to shock them and do something totally opposite, but you also want to play a different character. || I remember the first time my wife (then girlfriend) came over to the basement. I spent the entire day cleaning it, just so I could say, “Sorry the place is such a mess.” I had to clean all day to qualify for mess status. || Now, each baby is different, but this baby, whom we will call Hypothetical... || Sex after one child shows down. After twins… ooh… I’ll tell you what it is for us. I’ll share it with you. Every three months. We don’t plan it that way. That’s just how it works out. It’s the weirdest thing. You know what I do? Every time I have sex, the next day I pay my estimated tax. My quarterlies are due. If it’s oral sex, I renew my driver’s license. || I live in L.A. Now. || I love standup and I haven't given it up. || My twin boys are two and they’re cute… but when they become adults, the danger of identical twins, I hope they’re handsome. Because if they’re even slightly ugly, there’s two of those. You notice that. If you see one slightly ugly man walk across the room that’s no big deal. But if you see the same ugliness right behind him. “Hey! Look at that… I didn’t think he was that ugly until I saw it again.” || I married a saint - well, a saint who curses. || It is even better the second time now that my tongue isn't scared. || That’s the one thing I have over any twenty-one-year-old: a proud history of accumulated neuroses. That's the game in which I'm da man. || You know, before I would think, my cab driver hates me. Now I think my limo driver hates me. || The successful golfers - they're like astronauts or pilots. They have that demeanor that they can focus and stay within that one moment and nothing distracts them. That's not me. || The best comedy, I feel, comes in a drama because it balances each other out. || Right after 'Raymond' I had a world-is-my-oyster attitude, but I found out I don't like oysters. I had this existential emptiness. 'What is my purpose? Who am I?' I had a big identity crisis. || People are going to see both of us and think it's an Abbott and Costello kind of thing. It's not an easy switch. It's not an easy transition from TV to film. || My kids are growing up and it's hard to accept they are their own person and they're independent. || My career has been my craziest adventure. || You might think that’s an exaggeration but believe me, if you leave twin two-year-olds alone in your living room, at some point a cow will be airborne. || It seems to be a common denominator with a lot of comics, this low self-esteem thing. || If I'm really considering doing film from now on then that is the smart thing to do, or you can go either way. You can just do the same character over and over again and make a different comedy like over and over again. || I've always wondered, what am I going to do that's important with these stupid jokes that I tell. || I love stand-up and I haven't given it up. || I'm always giving myself the Alzheimer's test. My shrink told me to do this. It takes one minute. You name every word that comes to mind that begins with the letter F. || I'm aging, and the world is seeing it. || I'm a little different from the average dude because I'm on high-def TV now. || I would get my student loans, get money, register and never really go. It was a system I thought would somehow pan out. || I was wracked with insecurity. || I want to do well and I want to fit in. || If golf wasn't enjoyable and there wasn't a lot of humor and enjoyment, even though the game is so frustrating, you would wonder why you put yourself through it. || The married man has all but eliminated that worry from his life, simply because his wife knows all about him: the good, the bad, and the tiny. || It’s hard to idolize a ballplayer when you're forty and he’s, let’s say, twenty-one. How can I be yelling “You da man!” when he da kid? || Well, I'm a 14 handicap. Anyone who golfs knows what that means. || I had a very Italian house - the “plastic furniture you couldn’t sit on” house. Did anybody have the museum house? For a kid it’s traumatic. Towels you can never touch. China no one’s ever gonna use. Everything is for a special occasion that never happens. My mother was waiting for the Pope to show up for dinner. Or Sinatra. Or Chachi. || For the sake of your marriage, get a king-size bed. And if you really want to say married, get two. || Having children is like living in a frat house - nobody sleeps, everything's broken, and there's a lot of throwing up. || If my father had hugged me even once, I'd be an accountant right now. || The only thing I miss from the sitcom format is that immediate gratification of when you're, if we're talking about comedy, of the live audience. || I did 15 shows a week when I lived in New York. I did five shows on a Friday and seven shows on a Saturday. It was everything I did and it was my sole source of income. || My theory has always been that everyone in show business is there because they were deprived of some attention as a child. || You try to pretend like you're paying attention to your family, but in the meantime, you're like ""Grandma, can you pass the gravy? I'm open!"" || I think maybe my four-year-old has come up with a new metaphor. We don’t want “everything out of life,” we want “everything and a kite”! || Would I go to see a pediatrist or a proctologist to remove a foot from my ass? || When you go to standup, there seems to be a common denominator of some form of need or want for validation from the audience that maybe you were lacking as a kid. || Whenever I walk off the golf course, I thank God that I'm able to tell a joke. I thank God I'm good at something. || If you ever want to go golfing, take Brad with you. He will make you look better. He came in dead last. There were 75 celebrities and pro athletes and he came in dead last. || I'm now unemployed. It's a weird feeling with no work, but at least there's still golf. Standup comedy is like my core, it's what I do. But I want to be a pro golfer. It's a love/hate relationship with golf. I can come away feeling so serene, and yet, it's the thing that I can let get to me to throw a club and say curses that don't even exist. I'm obsessed with something that won't let me master it. I don't know. I need therapy. || When you talk to a kid on the phone, you gotta remember the conversation could go in any direction. You just gotta get ready. There’s no segues in the conversation. “Dad, are you coming home tomorrow?” “No, I’m not.” “I have 1,000 pennies.”"

Redd Foxx,"Music played a large role in the survival of the black people in America - that and a sense of humor that just couldn't be enslaved. || I feel sorry for people who don’t drink or do drugs. Because someday they’re going to be in a hospital bed, dying, and they won’t know why. || I'm going to get my bud-nipper and start nipping some bud! || I'm gonna put five of these where you sneeze. || Love. Hygiene. That's the important thing. Hygiene. The toughest thing in the world: you have to turn to your mate one night and say: ""You gotta wash your ass!"" Shit. Knowing how difficult it is, I said it for you: you gotta wash your ass. || You see, I can’t, on account of my Arthritis. || What's the difference between a pickpocket and a peeping tom? A pickpocket snatches watches. || This is the big one! You hear that, Elizabeth? I'm coming to join ya, honey! || Hey! Leave the door open will ya? The flies haven’t been out all day. || I'm gonna put five of these where you sneeze. ||  I ain't afraid to give you one across the lips! || There’s the members of the new partnership: Fuentes, Fuentes, Chico, and Dummo. || Lamont, when I die, it's not gonna be ""Sanford and Son"" no more; it's gonna be Nobody and Son. || You’re going into business with that Puerto Rican? You ought to call yourselves “Julio and Big Foolio.” || I carry a knife now because I read in a white magazine that all black people carry knives. So I rushed out and bought me one. || I ain’t from Africa. I’m from St. Louis. || Sanford and Son is more than just a name. It's a condition, a dynasty, an empire. This here is the finest pile of junk of the world. || What’s an archive, son? Is that anything like a closet? || That’s what happens when the “Big One” comes. You go to bed fine, then you wake up dead. || If I go over there I might have a heart attack when I see he’s dead. If I stay, I might have a heart attack just from the suspense of not knowing. So, whether I stay or I go, I go. || Fred was a funny kid, and I got a lot of humor from him. For a while, we were in a Catholic school up in Milwaukee, and Fred used to get laughs pulling an electric iron around the floor, like dragging a dog on a leash. Every day he had a new thing going with the iron. Fred was a great ball player too. He tried out with the Chicago White Sox, but that was years before Jackie Robinson made the break, and he was too early. || I'm a Sagittarian, see, I can't be fenced in. I been living in Las Vegas, greatest city in the world. I look out my window for 100 miles. In Vegas, there's nothing to do but gamble, drink or have sex. I have two of 'em. || It’s some chopped liver. That’s Jewish soul food. || Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing. || Junk runs in the family. My granddad was a junk man in St. Louis and so was my uncle. || When I worked in clubs, I had to be alert until 2, maybe 3 in the morning. I found it best to sleep during the daytime. || The food here is so tasteless you could eat a meal of it and belch and it wouldn't remind you of anything. || I am 65, my friends say I look 55, I feel 45, I'll settle for 35, and you make me feel 25! || A girl's legs are her best friends... but even the best of friends must part. || Beauty may be skin deep, but ugly goes clear to the bone. || You just dumb, son. You just dumb. || Do you realize that if the pilgrims have been chasing bobcats instead of turkeys... we'd all be eating pussy on Thanksgiving?! || For a dummy, you make a lot of sense. || We were poor. If I wasn't a boy, I wouldn't have had nothing to play with. || Certain things should be yours to have when you work your way to the top. || I feel right at home on this roast with you guys. It's like being in the ghetto... because in the ghetto you get stabbed in the back by total strangers too! || My first wife, I'll never forget her - and I've tried. || When you only make $3000 a year in social security, it's hard to be a philanthropist. || I'm callin' you ugly, I could stick yo face in some dough and make some gorilla cookies. || If God wanted you to eat Puerto Rican Food, he would have lined your stomach with Pepto Bismol. || It was awful at first. I'd lie awake all night, knowing that I had to rehearse 'Sanford,' the next day. But I was geared to being up late, I only caught a couple hours sleep each night for the first few months. || My Elizabeth was as pure as the driven snow; and I am the only driver she ever had! || I'm convinced that Sanford and Son shows middle-class America a lot of what they need to know. || The definition of indecent – when it’s in long, and it’s in hard, and it’s in deep – it’s in decent. || Hazel, if I hit you in the mouth, I bet your lips get to the hospital before the amulance. || I got a truck outside with my name on it: Sanford and Son. I’m Sanford and this is Son. || Esther, you wouldn't want a drink, because you are a drink - a zombie! || Esther, warn me before you come in so I have a chance to cover all of the mirrors! || When you see the handwriting on the wall, your in the toilet. || I tell you what I could use, new color TV. || I've been trying to get into the Royal Box in New York for years. They say I'm too dirty, my material is too blue. But I think Redd, the whites and blue can be a nice combination. || The show doesn't drive home a lesson, but it can open up people's minds enough for them to see how stupid every kind of prejudice can be."
Richard Belzer,"Munch is the guy who says what a lot of people wouldn't dare say. || No one is questioning the nobility and honor of these men and women that are serving and what they're doing. No one questions that. Now they're targets and they're not going out, they're just protecting each other and they're in the middle of a civil war. So it's really not fair to have these people, who volunteered their lives to protect our nation under false pretenses, to now be targets. || Anybody who thinks there's not a vast right-wing conspiracy in this country must also think that Ken Starr should be our next ambassador to Luxembourg. || It's this patronizing thing that people have about if you're against the war everyone's lumped together. You know, the soldiers are not scholars, they're not war experts. || There`s a division in most major police departments called, `Special Victims Unit,` which is what sex crimes are euphemistically called. They`re considered the most heinous crimes, when not only do you violate somebody, but you violate them sexually. So it`s an elite squad that takes care of that. || The only time Chevy Chase has a funny bone in his body is when I fuck him in the ass. || If you tell a lie that's big enough, and you tell it often enough, people will believe you're telling the truth, even if what you're saying is total crap. || I've known Chevy Chase for so long, I actually knew him when he was funny!"
Richard Jeni,"Today, I bought a pastrami sandwich: $13.75. Walked back out in the street - genuine Rolex watch: six bucks. || Imagine my surprise when it turned out the main thing that I was qualified for was to get another degree and teach Political Science to other people, who would, in turn, teach it to other people! This wasn't higher education, this was Amway with a football team! || I'm catholic in the same way, that if a cow was born in a tree, it's a bird! || Say whatever you want. But the United States has a kickass military and really good bullshit marketing people. If this country was a person it would be a used car salesman with a flamethrower. || I was brought up Catholic. My mom brought us to mass every Sunday - short for 'massive head trauma' that you get from your mother punching you in your little nine-year-old head every minute because you can't sit still for anything that's boring. || That's why you have to like a guy like Charles Manson. Say what you will about Manson - he's one of the only people with the decency to look like a dangerous maniac the first time you meet him. || Why is human cloning illegal? All it is is making a certain type of person on purpose. Can they possibly be any worse than the assholes we're pumping out by accident? || People always ask ""Rich, why don't you take a vacation?"" Why would I? I have no interests or hobbies. The only things I care about are naked women and comedy. If I do my job well it often provides both. || My mother never saw the irony of calling me a son of a bitch. || Animals are happier than humans because they're like furry little existentialists, all living in the moment. Their collective motto: live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking pelt. || In life your dreams may not come true, but sooner or later one of your nightmares will. || A bunch of bong-smoking, America-bashing, flag-burning, yoga-posing, incense-burning, dolphin-saving, salmon-eating hypocrites. These are the sensitive, liberal people who are always yelling about people's freedom of speech and expression, unless you happen to say something that pisses them off. || America - 20 million illegal immigrants can't be wrong! || It is a sad fact that 50 percent of marriages in this country end in divorce. But hey, the other half end in death. You could be one of the lucky ones! || Relationship are tough. Sex is easy. We take a good idea - sex - and turn it into a bad idea - marriage. Statistically the divorce rate is fifty percent and climbing. The ""I just had an orgasm and I didn't like it"" rate is holding steady at zero. || There is an obesity epidemic. One out of every three Americans... weighs as much as the other two. || Never fry bacon when you're naked. || The last president that anybody wanted to fuck was JFK. A woman president could be voted in if guys wanted to fuck her. If a female candidate with lots of sex appeal ever came along, her entire campaign could be “So vote for me and maybe I'll fuck ya”. She'd win by a landslide 'cause guys will do anything to get laid. || Easiest job you could ever have… whoever gets to put Michael Jackson in a witness chair and create ""reasonable doubt."" || In New York, the principal leisure activity is internal bleeding. || You should never die for your beliefs, because what if you're wrong? || If you have a choice of selling shoes to ladies or giving birth to a flaming porcupine... look into that second, less painful career. || A bunch of money-grubbin', greenhouse-gasing, seal-clubbing, oil-drilling, Bible-thumping, missile-firing, right-to-life-ing, lethal-injecting hypocrites. People whose idea of a good time is strapping a dead panda to a Lincoln Navigator and running over everybody in the gay parade. || The Web brings people together because no matter what kind of a twisted sexual mutant you happen to be, you've got millions of pals out there. Type in ""Find people that have sex with goats that are on fire"" and the computer will say, ""Specify type of goat"". || They had a sign up: the lobsters were flown in. How cruel is that? Think about that - let's say you're a lobster, you've never been on an airplane before - what else can you think, but you've won the lobster sweepstakes? || Success is made up of courage, brains, and luck. Since the first two are a function of the third, it's pretty much all luck. || When you talk to the manhood, mark your tone well. 'Cause if the manhood's insulted, then the manhood can't swell. If he doesn't feel strong, and he doesn't feel stout, then he'll sulk and he'll pout, and he'll never come out. So if you want that love to continue to thrive, Ladies, sit there, shut up, and let the dick drive. || They should just call it The Bad News. The bloodiest, most disgusting things that happened today packed into a half an hour, right before you go to bed. You thought you were scared before... || Porno is just like any other drug; after a while you start building up a tolerance to it. || I always look for a woman who has a tattoo. I see a woman with a tattoo, and I'm thinking, OK, here's a gal who's capable of making a decision she'll regret in the future. || Michael Jackson is what happens when you keep fixin' it until it's broke! || I wish I had a condom on right now at the bar. If only I had a piece of disgusting, greasy rubber just strangling the base of my tallywacker with enough force to cause my eyes to fly out on springs, like someone from a Warner Brothers cartoon, and ripping out pubic hairs in eight different locations - what a night! || We're all a little bit hypocritical and we could all help people more than we do. You know you're sitting there watching TV, it's late at night. Then you hear: ""For $9 a week, you could help this starving child."" Everyone has the $9, but how do you not give it to them? You gotta rationalize it somehow. You just go, ""Ehh that kid doesn't look that hungry to me. Shit he's got a bigger belly than I do. How you can you feed a kid for $9 a week, that's impossible! Shit a Low-Fat, Low Carb latte is $4.50. Whats that kid gonna do with 2 giant cups of coffee? I'm actually doing him a favor not giving him any money, because there's nothing worse than being wide awake and starving. You're welcome Haboopoo."" || I finally got her to watch a porno with me, and I did not get the reaction I was after. Alright, I shouldn't have started her off with one that I was in - that was a mistake. || This is the guy I'll be thinking about when I put a gun to my head. || Honesty is the key to a relationship. If you can fake that, you're in. || There are only two reasons to sit in the back row of an airplane: Either you have diarrhea, or you're anxious to meet people who do. || Lobsters one of the only animals that have to put up with being alive in the restaurant. If you go to a steakhouse, folks - no cow tank. || Religious war at its simplest is killing each other over who has the best imaginary friend. || To me, the acceptable level of fecal matter is... zero. || Married or Single? There is no good choice. It’s like when your doctor says, 'Ointment?' or 'Suppositories'? || If you ever thought you were ugly, Los Angeles is the place to come and find out you were right. || I think that's how Chicago got started. A bunch of people in New York said, ""Gee, I'm enjoying the crime and the poverty, but it just isn't cold enough. Let's go west."" || We spend the second half of our life making up for the first half. || Ridiculous that some people feel superior to the gay minority. They're the only couples you'll ever find poking around for ceramics and candle holders in the winery gift shop and both parties really want to be there. || Nobody is really qualified to be the president. Basically it's an acting job. You have to act like you're the president. And every four years the country holds a big casting call. || An adult male human that attempts to mate frequently but spends most of its time alone. || The government scares me. They're taking my picture at the stop sign. They're looking through my shoes at the airport. They're worried about gay people getting married, locking up potheads, having congressional investigations because of Janet Jackson's tit. You're better off committing murder or rape because those things you can get away with. || It's always the guy who gets the diarrhea on the commercial at an inconvenient moment. As if you've ever been in a situation: 'You know, this would be a great time to get the runs, you think? I mean the sun's out, we're on the ferris wheel - what are we waiting for?' || Double, double, toil and trouble. A dash of menstruation, a little chardonnay, now you’ll be wrong no matter what you say! || Sports are an acceptable way for men to show emotion. A guy who won't hug his kid will slip a guy a tongue in a sports bar when his team wins. || Success is like toilet paper, it only seems important when you don't have it. || Know why it takes so many sperm to fetrtilize one egg - cause none of those fuckers will ask for directions. || We would need less gun control if we had better birth control. || I think there are people on other planets looking at us and going, “Oh yeah, the Earth, we used to have a place there, but then that whole neighbourhood went”. || The way I see it, we're all on the Hindenberg. Why fight over the window seats? || You know what the average person is? Average. || Choosing to have a child you can't take care of is like farting in an elevator. Sure you got it out, but not it's everyone else's problem. || In any relationship there are certain doors that should never be opened. The bathroom door, for example. || It's better to be alone than to wish you were alone. || Why do some people think aquariums are cruel? The fish love it there! They told me. The said, “Truthfully Rich, it's fucking awesome. There's no predators. No nets, no pollution. It's like the ocean without all the bullshit.” || Spiritual is the word people use when they mean they want to be covered whey they die but they're not getting up early on a Sunday. || When on guy sees an invisible man he's a nut case. Ten people see him it's a cult. Ten million people see him it's a respected religion. || Hello! Welcome to ""Cooking That Has Nothing To Do With Anyone's Actual Life."" Today we're making a very complicated recipe, using ingredients you don't have, utensils you've never heard of, in a kitchen bigger than your whole bloody house! || There is no romance without some lying. That's what romance is - a little bit of Vaseline on the camera lens of life. || In the United States economic system you can lose big or you can win big. If you lose you wind up wearing a Hefty bag and sleeping in a doorway. If you win you can have sex with Catherine Zeta Jones when you're seventy-five. || Live each day as if it were the last day of your life because, so far, it is. || Seventy-five percent of all Americans believe that angels are real. Which is amazing when you consider that forty percent of all Americans think DNA evidence is unreliable. || I wanted a bumper sticker that wouldn't be controversial. On my bumper sticker it says, “I'd rather be coming”. || Brooklyn is the only place where a guy can open up a candy store sell no candy and gross over eight million dollars a year. || I got involved with this pro-choice group. Their slogan is, “Raising kids is murder”. || Basically it's the priests don't like the cloning, so we can make a compromise. For every cell that we use to make a heart valve we'll done one for them. It'll be a portable twelve-year-old boy's butt with five openings, four for personal use and one to call Bingo every Thursday. || I met a girl, we ate, we drank, had sex, got married, had affairs, broke up – God, what a night that was!"
Richard Lewis,"My favorite holiday is Co-dependency Day. || One hip thing about being a recovering addict is I can spot assholes a mile away. || My shrink told me that my progress was pointless and she'd prefer to still keep me as a patient but analyze someone else in my place. || New Year's Eve never made sense to me because of the fear I suddenly had about the following minute. || I've learned the hard way. Now I only strive for imperfection. || My life is the sum of other peoples' experiences. || The greatest three seconds in my life was when I fell in love. || If you feel comfortable in your own skin it's not yours. || I'm great in bed when I'm alone. || To be as transparent and fearless as I can here are some answers. No. No. Of course. Never. Won't happen. ASAP. I'm too afraid. || To be on the safe side I use a condom when I masturbate. || I got screwed when my parents passed away. They left me their unfinished business. || Love your kids unconditionally. My mother had an onlooker breastfeed me. || Don't take death for granted. || I live in a predominantly anxious section of town. || I hope I'm able to relive my future. || A cop just pulled me over and told me to stop blaming my childhood. || My mom had gossip dyslexia... she'd gossip in front of people's backs. || Lots of people fake orgasms but I fake serenity. || Nightmares are killing me so I'm going to sleep doing impressions. || Someone just told me that I enjoyed my weekend. || I think most politicians are bisexual than bipartisan. || My relatives all put in chips in their TV's to block my appearances. || If you are going through an emotional nightmare be grateful that it is only a nightmare. || During her pregnancy my mother referred to me as a ""wreck-in-progress."" || If there is reincarnation and I come back as myself, I'll kill myself. || Nothing is happening and that is a very cool sign. || My parents didn't want to get divorced until they passed away. || My car broke down this morning before I did. || Emotionally, the hardest part about living for me is being me. || My shrink gives me 75 per cent off if I make believe I'm someone else. || When I was a kid at my birthday parties my mom would say, ""make a death-wish and blow out the candles."" || Have a good night pals. I mean someone has to. || Life's a beautiful thing. With every passing day I have more to worry about. || Happiness is fear-based. || I am much more comfortable in someone else's skin. || The best tip for insomnia for me is not trying to sleep. || My family taught me to take regrets one day at a time. || I have ditched every resentment in my life except that tricky one against myself. || Dealing with joy sometimes is more difficult than overcoming adversity if you enjoy self-loathng as a hobby. || I'm looking forward to yesterday. || The only reason I sound depressed is because I'm tired of anxiety. || For my sake I hope this is the first day of somebody else's life. || I'm so disgusted by feeling disgusted I've decided to accept it. || I never thought that intolerance would be patriotic. || I'm the first person in history to die in my own dream but It turned out only to be a stunt double. || There's no place like home that's why I never went back. || I guess I am a true narcissist. I convinced my dog to walk me. || My mother was taught by a nasty ventriloquist who lived nearby my childhood home to throw guilt without moving her conscience. || I'm best in bed sexually when I'm alone and especially during a quake. || When I die I've decided to cremate any night club owner or promoter who is still alive. || My shrink is so baffled she now blames her own childhood for my anxiety. || My parents took a leave of absence moments after my birth. || I'll have a great weekend if I'm not involved. || I enjoy life as long as it is not my own. || I'll never die. Been there done that. || I was having a great day until I woke up. || I never take enough credit for my failures. || Life is a myth. Death is real. Orgasms rule. || I wrote my nightmares out this afternoon so I can get a good night's sleep tonight. || Why put on an act on stage when I'm tragically myself. || Growing up I felt so invisible and inconsequential my parents finally insisted that I wear a name tag at home. || How dare people chastise me saying my glass is always half empty... it's totally empty. || There was a big study in Boston, Harvard, a big medical test. Rats would rather starve than not do a Quayle joke. || I usually meet people at my doctors' offices because I go all the time. It's embarrassing. Like at the skin doctor last week, in the lobby, the nurse said, 'Hi Mr. Lewis. Do you still have that rash on your behind?' || In my teens my folks used a drone look-alike kite to see if I was masturbating too much. || Sobriety worked for me but I have so much clarity now I hate myself even more. || I'm a recovering alcoholic but at least I do have cough medicine on tap. || It's more important to put pressure in your tires than on yourself. || Marriage was the only way to truly find out that I was the wrong choice. || I bug myself to take the pressure off of my pals. || There's nothing to fear but life itself. || I lied to my shrink today. I told her the truth. || I quit therapy because my analyst was trying to help me behind my back. || My grandfather used to make home movies and edit out the joy. || What’s a Jewish mobster? I’m going to break the legs of your therapist. || My mother calls at five-thirty in the morning. I'm not a dairy farm. I don't like phone calls before six in the morning. || You can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar, but either way you've got flies. || I just unfollowed myself. Why follow an idiot. || Life can be a bitch so at least try not to fall in love with one. || I had trouble with the last relationship. I got scared a little bit and had two Amish people come over who were friends of mine. They had an erection raising. || When I was growing up, my mom would have a toast at the beginning of a reunion: 'You're killing your father.' || If I'm on the toilet for more than two minutes, I take Dramamine. That's how nauseous I get. || I purposefully studied ventriloquism so I can throw my orgasm - which was sort of a sad moment in my life. || Most of my family were nuts. My mother gave my sister's dolls polio shots. || I have over 18 years sober but am still just a minute away from going insane again. || Last night my wife and I had an amazing, simultaneous panic-attack. || My grandmother was a Jewish juggler: she used to worry about six things at once. || I'm a hypochondriac. Backstage, I don't sign autographs - I signed a valium for some woman. || Life and mental illness aside, the only reason to stay miserable is life or mental illness. || First class mail sucks. What is third class mail? They must strap a letter on the back of a mental patient and he wanders aimlessly. || Don't worry about dying, worry about living. || Nothing matters until you realize that nothing really matters other than helping others who live as if nothing will ever really matter. || Most Texans think Hanukkah is some sort of duck call. || I’m a major hypochondriac. I won’t even masturbate anymore. I’m afraid I might give myself something. || Depression can be a mirage. || Before I have masturbation, I say to myself, 'Break a leg.' While I masturbate, I actually fantasize that I'm somebody else. In fact, if I do it in different rooms, I actually feel that I'm cheating on myself - which is sad. || On Thanksgiving my mom put black armbands on the turkey wings so we would remember our dead relatives. || Celebrities are just normal, screwed up people like everyone else who just don't know who you are. You're just as important. || I hired three people to watch my back but they were killed so now I have a team of gypsies watch my future and let the present worry alone. || I believe in unidentified flying obstacles. || Comedy is hard. Complaining is easy. || My family only looked human in fun house mirrors. || I already wish I could relive my future. || If you have a date tonight, play it safe and leave your heart at home. || Being sober for 18 years, now when I take prescribed medicine I pray for hip, side effects. || It's stressful being a hypochondriach. In my home I have a walk-in medicine chest. || The biggest plus of marriage is finally realizing that we are alone. || Given human nature, as far as I'm concerned, I think each of us should have a legal option before we are forced to be included in mankind. || My ist grade teacher was so obsessive-compulsive, that for fire drills she made us line up in alphabetical order. || The greatest impact on my life has been nothing. || I'm a cautious pessimist. || Founding Fathers didn't worship Jesse James or Al Capone. Protect yourself but gun reform will save murders and suicides in the long run. || They flew me out in this plane that was only first class. It was all first class. It was the most psychotic thing I've ever seen in my life. The drinking that went on - it was like Mardi Gras. The nose of the plane started to develop red veins. || My grandparents had a satellite dish. They were the first ones, like, in 1961. It was like a Jewish one: it picked up problems from other families. || God forbid I should have a simultaneous orgasm with anybody. My goal this year is to make love being naked. || Happiness is overrated. || If I have an orgasm, I feel that I have to give six weeks of community service to various charities. || I can't shop for young kids. My good friends are angry at me because I bought their 5 yr-old a boy a ""scene of the accident"" coloring book. || I'd be far more content if I could mind someone else's business. || Acceptance and forgiveness are crucial components to a happy life and hopefully I can find mine in storage. || I don't trust vitamins. I saw one today for loss of hair and esteem. || One of the pluses of being married with no kids is that my wife can have more free time after she tucks me in. || Even at home, on my stationary exercise bike, I have a rearview mirror. || I find masturbation to be too intimate quite frankly. In fact, I won’t even masturbate unless I promise myself to take myself afterwards out to a dinner and a film. Which is sad. || I have so much on my mind yet so little to say. || Low self-esteem sex is bad. Here’s the deal: when I have an orgasm I shriek, “I’m sorry!” || I love being famous. It validates that I have something to say. || If I stop complaining I'll have nothing to compain about. || ""The times they are a changin"" mostly for those who need it least. || When I was a kid my family said having feelings was an act of treason. || I'm trying to drop an asshole a day from my life and doing the math I'll be done in the year 3011. || I was thinking about The Boss, The King. It's sort of sad - the next legend, what are they gonna do? 'Ladies and gentlemen, Veal Cutlet!' || If you make love - if you're lucky enough to have a partner - let it out. Shriek like a baboon, man. I have this theory: at the moment of my conception, my mother shushed my father during his orgasm. It gave me low self-esteem. || She was an egomaniac. We would make love. She went, 'I only want to make love on my good side.' She would have an orgasm and say, 'I love me.' || My shrink told me I had an out-of-family experience when I was growing up. || I'm not that promiscuous; she was. I mean, I should have known. I mean, she put a triangle over the bed. Before we made love, which was sad, she went, 'Come and get it.' || We ran out of classical music - that's how long this wedding went on. || I don't like horror movies because I'm squeamish. But I go because my ex's like to go. They like to pull for the antichrist. || Here's the deal. If you're with somebody who you love, they should want you in bed. That's it. Once it goes south in bed, that's it. You don't want to be in bed with somebody that says, 'I'll race you to sleep.' || She was hostile. You don't have an orgasm and say to your lover, 'Take that!' || It was so important for me just to have my ex feel good in bed. The low point was when I started to sing, 'Here we go, orgasm! Here we go!' And then when it finally happened, running a victory lap - that was sad. And the high fives, wasn't that unnecessary? || We had our own Olympics and forget the color war. We had the colon wars, which was sort of sad. The rabbi was the head of the sports department, and he said, 'Let the injuries begin!' || Little kids ask questions every second. She must have asked a thousand questions in one block, and finally, I panicked. She went, 'What are those clouds made of?' I'm an idiot anyway - I go, 'Steam from a hot dog.' || I'm like President Ford: I can't do two things at once. I can't have intercourse and enjoy myself at the same time. || I fall in love so fast. I come back after the first date, I tell my friends, 'She's unbelievable!' And they say, 'What did she do?' 'I don't know. I think she's a mammal.' || We made love, and I thought she had an orgasm. I said, 'Well, did you have an orgasm?' She said, 'Yeah, but I was hoping for a series.' || I have lowered my expectations, sexually. I don't care what happens in bed anymore as long as I don't make any grammatical errors. || I wear ear condoms. I don't even want to listen to what I might be contracting. || Experience tells me that if I could watch my own back I wouldn't. || She was wacko. She was an only child, but she still had a sibling rivalry. || I expected to much from my expectations fast and I'm all screwed up again... but I expected that to happen. || Don't expect life to care about your expectations, just boast about the failures. || Lower your expectations and live your life like it isn't yours. || I people-please everyone but myself. || My shrink told me it was pointless to believe in myself. || People don't get me. I'm not miserable or depressed, I'm just anxious and occasionally agitated. || You can lead a fanatic to water but you can't make him think. || Crap, I have a new obsession... I second-guess other people. || Many in the Senate and the Congress care more about their jobs on a watered-down bill over potential mass murders and suicides with guns. || The best way to have an affair without feeling guilty is to sleep with your therapist. || There is nothing wrong with having a positive attitude as long as it doesn't bug you. || When I die I'll be cremated and my ashes sprinkled over my shrink's toupee. || We get into bed, and she says, 'You're not going to use your penis, are you?' || When I moved in with this lady, I just... I mean, I walked into the bedroom - you know, we're looking at this apartment - and I said, 'What's this handwriting on the wall?' || It's low self-esteem. I understand; I was brought up with it. I go on the road - when I do concerts, I bring a portable Wailing Wall. I'm always prepared. || This weekend I pulled a muscle in my cheeks trying to smile. || I'll take a vaction if I don't go. || When you're in love it's the most glorious two and a half days of your life. || I'll speak for me, though it's hard for me to speak for myself because I don't know who I am. || I was prescribed an anti-biotic that had over 44 million possible side effects including a desire to kidnap. || I tried phone sex and got an ear infection. || A woman can have sex with whoever she wants, a man only with whoever allows him. || I've always been a hypochondriac. As a little boy, I'd eat my M & M's one by one with a glass of water. || My beautiful rescue dog, Bella Luna Lewis, has decided to put me up for adoption. || Sobriety is something you do for yourself. I sure don't miss blackouts but the downside is having the clarity to know who I am. || Sadly, the worst audience I ever had were my parents. || Anyone who has faith in humanity is probably an uneducated extraterrestrial. || I live each day like it is someone else's last so I have a better shot at joy. || I think; therefore I worry. || I never care what people think of me, especially myself. || She said that after we had intercourse, I gave her an anti-climax. || One of my uncles said that apparently at birth I snuck out… I thought maybe someone was following me. || At home now, I have cough medicine on tap. || Before sleeping together today, people should boil themselves. || They say, ""you only hurt the one"" you love, so thankfully I'm off the hook. || If I would've married me I would have outlawed foreplay. I would have been pissed at myself in bed but had more time to read great novels. || I don't blame my parents for my dysfunctions... I blame their parents. || I stopped having intimacy problems when my lovers did impressions of other women. || An amateur ventriloquist, my dad could throw his chest pains. || The only person I can barely compromise with is myself. || If I don't take anything that I say seriously only an idiot would. || Depression isn't affected by gravity. || My family wasn’t very religious. On Hanukkah, they had a menorah on a dimmer. || I have low self-esteem; when were in bed together, I would fantasize that I was someone else. || I get intimacy booster shots once a week at my doctor. || My nightmares have coming attractions. || My family used depression to hide from anxiety. || Desperation is my sweet spot. || Today is the last day of the beginning of my life. || When in doubt you might be right. || I tried to be rigorously honest with my flaws and it was clear that I couldn't be friends with myself. || We can't agree on religion and guns and economics and sadly civil rights but if the wealthy won't chip in for the needy we are done. || Perception is reality; so being so twisted I have no idea who I ever was which was a really lucky break. || I blew off meditation for worrying and found myself. || My wife loves me for what I could've been. || I lost my virginity alone... at least that's what the chick told me. || Nowhere is a great place to start. || If I keep all my disorders to a minimum every day then by about 2053 I should have a handle on practically nothing. || Anyone who has faith in humanity is probably an uneducated extraterrestrial. || If I can keep away from myself I'll have a great weekend. || I don't care what people think of me because I never cared what I thought about myself. || People judge you because they have no faith in themselves. || My nitemares are so hip I go to bed eating popcorn. || My grandparents - life was food. I go, 'Grandma, I don't feel well. I'm suicidal.' She says, 'You're hungry. You're just hungry.' || On New Year's Eve, people in New Jersey stay up 'til midnight and watch their hopes drop. || What good are family values if they are built on hate. || I'd rather be wrong than think I'm right and bug people. || Fear of intimacy thankfully keeps me from getting close to myself. || Nothing is happening but I'll ruin it. || I started having intimacy problems during my breast-feeding. || I try to live in the moment but other people ruin it. || The more you want the less you get. || My ego wears an Ace bandage. || Political views divide faster than marriages. || The only thing worse than a comedian who rips off premises and jokes is the thief who thinks he didn't do it. || My child-rearing was blocked out by an eclipse. || I pray that I have my afterlife before I die. || My family tree had some poisonous roots. || If you have to work at feeling lust towards your significant other maybe it is time to get a day job. || The first sentence that I was taught to say by my parents as a little boy was, "" Of course I know that I'm wrong."" || I thrive on imperfection. || I would believe in reincarnation but too many of me ex-girlfriends did and it isn't worth the risk. || I'm also concerned about reincarnation because if I was hexed and came back as myself I'd kill myself. || I like to isolate if I can avoid myself. || Resentments are a waste of time. One day I'll stop resenting myself. || The longer that I live the less time I have to worry. || To be safe I strive for imperfection. || I love life! One day maybe it'll be my own. || I'm so isolated that most of my life I don't know where I am. || If you feel ill at ease in your own skin get it taliored. || I feel grandiose when I feel truly happy. || My therapist thinks I'd be better off living in a dream-state. || If I could rent someone else's subconscious occasionally maybe I could get a decent night's sleep. || The monkey on my back is me. || I can't be in two places at one time unless I'm alone. || The secret to a happy life is to have zero expectations and try to not trust prop comics. || I can't sleep because I keep dreaming that I'm me... || Just woke up after a nightmare only to reaiize it is far safer asleep than me making breakfast and always paranoid about poisoning myself. || My nightmares have coming attractions. || As a child my parents said they believed in Santa Claus but that I didn't exist. || My shrink told me that my happiness was stress related. || I'd deeply apologize to Richard Lewis for my offensive slurs to myself. || Contrary to public opinion, I'm not negative, just realistic. || For sanity,I just cut down my family tree. || My shrink is bored and insists that I create and blame my darkness on another family. || I'm the Descartes of anxiety; I panic, therefore I am. || I just fired my shrink. She called me the ""Every-Mess."" || When John and Yoko promoted. ""Give Peace a Chance"" my folks sadly thought they just meant our family. || Artistic idols of mine who died got an average mention of 22 seconds on the local news. Bottom-line fame-seekers, sleep with news anchors. || Happiness sets me up for needless despondency. || I've managed to forgive everyone who screwed me but myself. || Don't count on others to care about you more than you do about yourself or you'll probably run away with the circus and hide forever. || To avoid conflict, agree with everything your signicant other says, no matter how moronic, until eventually you feel guilt-free breaking up. || My mother sadly claimed, that my birth was just a coincidence. || Even if I'm aroused, my penis is in the shape of a question mark. || I inherited my low-self esteem from my family. My grandfather's mantra was ""I suck therefore I am."" || I couldn't sleep as usual so I finally decided to close my eyes and it worked for a while. How come I never knew this technique? || Good morning... never experienced that myself. || I have no regrets mainly because my memory is shot. || As a recovering addict I know resentments are trouble so I have none except resenting myself. || I never give advice - I give warnings to live by. || If history repeats itself I'm hopeful that I can get out of it with a note from my shrink. || Today I followed my instincts and never got out of bed. || If I knew as a young man what I know now I still would have felt lost. || Don't let morons judge you... Do what I do... I moronically judge myself first and get it over with... But on my watch."
Richard Pryor,"Freebase? What's free about it? || It seemed fair to kill my car to me, right, ‘cause my wife was going to leave my ass. I say, “Not in this motherfucker you ain’t. Uh-uh. If you leave me you be drivin’ them Hush Puppies you got on. ‘Cause I’m goin’ kill this motherfucker here.” || It's easy to love somebody. Shit, sit with them a little bit and talk to them a while. || If you want some pussy, you'll talk all that shit with them. 'Hey, yeah, sure,, the cosmos.. sure..' || When I was on vacation in Africa, I went out in the country. Where you see some lions and shit. I'm talking about real lions, not them kind you be fucking with in the zoo. Hey, lion, motherfucker. || I went to Zimbabwe. I know how white people feel in America now; relaxed! Cause when I heard the police car I knew they weren't coming after me! || I ain't no movie star, man. I'm a booty star. || What I never understand about a hangover is, where does the breath come from? You know what I mean? I mean, is someone shitting in your mouth? || There was a time in my life when I thought I had everything - millions of dollars, mansions, cars, nice clothes, beautiful women, and every other materialistic thing you can imagine. Now I struggle for peace. || I think about dying. I've come to realize we all die alone in one way or another. || There's a thin line between to laugh with and to laugh at. || Fuckin' is good for you, Jack. Gettin' some pussy beats having a war. || When the show don't be funny, I take my dick out and piss. This is called The Garden Row. || So after Another You I ran off to my very own piece of paradise, my home in Hana. || There's nothing worse than being an aging young person. || My grandmother used to discipline me, I mean, beat my ass, and I deserved them, too. || Motherfucker looked at me like I owed him money. (on Reagan) || Booty is just a ghetto expression, and I'm just a booty star. || You don't get to be old bein' no fool... || I was brought up in a whorehouse in Peoria. My mother and father lived there and worked there. || What I'm saying might be profane, but it's also profound. || I went through every phone book in Africa, and I didn't find one goddamned Pryor! || When I hear 'yee-haw!', that scare the shit outta me. Cuz I know what come next. Y'all remember? Y'all's ancestors used to hang us for kicks? ..Muthafuckin on the weekend, hot, couldn't get no pussy? 'Let's go down to the jail, get a couple of them black ones and just string 'em up. ..yeehaww..' ..When I hear that, shit crawl all up and down my neck. || Who you gonna believe, bitch? Me? or your lying eyes? || In March I had a minor heart attack while I was vacationing in Australia. it scared me, but it was nothing compared to what someone had in store for me down the road. || When that fire hit your ass, it will sober your ass up quick! I saw something, I went, ""Well, that's a pretty blue. You know what? That looks like... FIRE! Fire is inspirational. They should use it in the Olympics, because I ran the 100 in 4.3. || I couldn't stop drinking until the bartender said, ""We got no more fucking liquor! Now take your ass home, pal."" || I don't want to go through life as a Wonder Wheel murderer! || You can't talk about fucking in America, people say you're dirty. But if you talk about killing somebody, that's cool. || I live in racist America and I'm uneducated, yet a lot of people love me and like what I do, and I can make a living from it. You can't do much better than that. || I had some great things and I had some bad things. The best and the worst... In other words, I had a life. || Marriage is really tough because you have to deal with feelings... and lawyers. || I was kicked out of school because of my attitude. I was not assimilating. So I went to work, taking any jobs I could get. || My father died fucking. He did. My father was 57 when he died. The woman was 18. My father came and went at the same time. || I think about being married again, having a home and a wife. No one can ever be married too many times, and maybe if I keep trying I'll get it right one day. || Everyone carries around his own monsters. || I don't see myself getting married again, but if I do, it will be forever. || You work your butt off and somebody says you can't have your record played because it offends them. Tyrants are made of such stuff. || The way I see it, the earth is going to be here after we're dead and gone. Even if it's a polluted planet, and they messed it up. Where do they go from here - to another planet so they can mess that up too? || I urge you to ask yourself just how honorable it is to preside over the abuse and suffering of animals. || Even when I was a little kid, I always said I would be in the movies one day, and damned if I didn't make it. || Movies are movies, and I don't think any of them are going to hurt the moral fiber of America and all that nonsense. || I'm not for integration and I'm not against it. || Yes, I'm religious. God has shown me things, made certain ways clear to me. || Imagine people calling you to find out if you're dead. I've led a real crazy life at times, and I've had many strange things happen to me, but that was one of the strangest. || A sold-out house my first night back. Do you have any idea what kinda pressure that is? I could have been at home in my warm bed, playing Nintendo. || Sure, I have friends, plenty of friends, and they all come around wantin' to borrow money. I've always been generous with my friends and family, with money, but selfish with the important stuff like love. || Comedy rules! Don't let anybody tell you otherwise, and there are no rules in stand-up comedy, which I really like. You can do anything you want and you can say anything that comes to mind, just so long as it's funny. If you ain't funny then get the fuck off the stage, it`s that simple. || I couldn't stop. I put the pipe down. It jumped back in my hand. || What I am for is justice for everyone, just like it says in the Constitution. || I'll kick this... if I have to, 'cuz I'm not giving up. || When I was in Africa, this voice came to me and said, ""Richard, what do you see?"" I said, ""I see all types of people."" The voice said, ""But do you see any niggers?"" I said, ""No."" It said, ""Do you know why? 'Cause there aren't any."" || I don't understand what goes on some times, right, cuz here we are in this theater, we gettin along just fine. We go outside and the shit change. || To be diagnosed was the hardest thing because I didn't know what they were talking about... And the doctor said, ""Don't worry, in three months you'll know."" So I went about my business and then, one day, it jumped me. I couldn't get up... Your muscles trick you; they did me. || Someone called all the newspapers in New York and told them I'd died. I've been told by almost everyone it was an ex-wife - I've had a few so it's hard to pinpoint which one - but who knows for sure? || I won't talk about what it was like in prison, except to say I'm glad I'm out and that I plan never to go back and to pay my taxes every day. || If I thought about it, I could be bitter, but I don't feel like being bitter. Being bitter makes you immobile, and there's too much that I still want to do. || I became a performer because it was what I enjoyed doing. || I believe the ability to think is blessed. If you can think about a situation, you can deal with it. The big struggle is to keep your head clear enough to think. || You gotta be cool when you're macho man, cuz you can't be sensitive and care about someone having a good time in bed, cuz that's too scary... When you don't use sensitivity when you're having sex, or share some of your soul, nothing gonna happen, because men really get afraid. Men really get scared in bed. || White people go; Why you guys hold your things? Cause you done took every thing else, motherfucker! || I woke up in an ambulance. And it wasn’t nothing but white people staring at me. I said, “Ain’t this a bitch. I done died and wound up in the wrong muthafucking heaven.” || I'm not addicted to coke, i just love the way it smells! || There's a lot more hypocrisy than before. Racism has gone back underground. || It's been a struggle for me because I had a chance to be white and refused. || I love show business. I wake up every morning and kiss it. || Slaves built all this shit down here.. Or carried the shit that built it.. (on New Orleans) || See, I had some drugs and shit right now, I wouldn't give a fuck. But I'd come off stage, and I still wouldn't give a fuck. Then, by the time you're 50, a lotta 'no-givin-a-fuck', you missed part your life. || It's so much easier for me to talk about my life in front of two thousand people than it is one-to-one. I'm a real defensive person, because if you were sensitive in my neighborhood you were something to eat. || Have you ever noticed how quiet you get when you go in the woods? It's almost like you know that God's there. || I went to the White House, met the president... We in trouble. (on Reagan) || I'm not addicted to cocaine... I just like the way it smells. || I had one girlfriend, she had one of them ""recto-mies."" You know, that's where they scoop the pussy out and leave the box it came in. We got along just fine. She didn't want nothin' from me, and I sure didn't want nothin' from her. || White people go; Why you guys hold your things? Cause you done took every thing else, motherfucker! || I believe in the institution of marriage, and I intend to keep trying till I get it right. || I'd like to make you laugh for about ten minutes though I'm gonna be on for an hour. || The man would box so good it'd make your dick hard! || The reason people use a crucifix against vampires is that vampires are allergic to bullshit. || Most people that you talk to, they's intelligent. Like I said, ""Most people."" || I'm for human lib, the liberation of all people, not just black people or female people or gay people. || There are only two pieces of pussy you're gonna get in your entire life, that's your first and your last. || I just don't want to die alone, that's all. That's not too much to ask for, is it It would be nice to have someone care about me, for who I am, not about my wallet. || I had to stop drinkin', cuz I got tired of waking in my car driving ninety. || It used to be Rhodesia, before they killed all them white muthafuckas. || I know that if I wasn't scared, something's wrong, because the thrill is what's scary. || Friends take up time, and I didn't have time. || I realized this is what God has dealt me, and I should be thankful considering all that's happened to me in my life, but MS caused the movies to stop - stop dead - and I miss it. || I never met anybody who said when they were a kid, I wanna grow up and be a critic. || When you ain't got no money, you gotta get an attitude. || Bitch was so fine I'd suck her daddy's dick. || Let me tell you what really happened. Usually when I go to bed, I have milk and cookies. And One night I had some low-fat milk and some pasteurized, And I mixed them together. And I dipped my cookie and the shit blew up. || They fucked around, started negotiating with those white people, they lost all that shit... And what they didn't lose negotiating, white people just kicked their ass on out of.. || You have to have lived some life. You've got to have paid some dues. || How's my mama? How's your mama? I will slap you in the mouth with my dick. || I was a loner and never hung out with anyone. I never had any friends. || I can't just say the words, do a lot of one-liners. I love each person I play; I have to be that person. I have to do him true. || How do you 'accidentally' shoot a nigga in the chest six times? 'Well, my gun fell and just went crazy!' || Hawaii is the best form of comfort for me. When I die, I want to be cremated, and I want half my ashes spread in the Pacific around the island, the rest on the property. || That's insanity. We must be good all the time. || I had a breakup. I decided that I wasn't going to do the sort of routines I was doing anymore. So I went to work, trying to develop the thing I do now. || Unfortunately, the show's success comes at the expense of its biggest asset -- the comedians themselves. || He's just always positive. He's always smiling and he's always trying. || I also say that if there isn't a response to what's been happening to the people out there, there's going to be a great explosion one of these days, and this will not be one of the nicest places to live. || I believe in divine forces and energies. || I bought my parents a home before they died, and they got to see that I was going to be all right. They always thought I would go someplace. || I was given two weeks to walk again, so I hooked up with a trainer, and he... had me walking. I'll never forget that, it was grueling. || I'm going back out on the road. I love it, but I do need the money. It's a very safe high for me. || The black groups that boycott certain films would do better to get the money together to make the films they want to see, or stay in church and leave us to our work. || I'm going through a humbling experience these days. || I'm slower and some days are better than others, but I'm a fighter. || No, I'm not dying, and I sure... ain't dead. || You can have a film and have 200 white people working on it, and nobody finds anything wrong with that. But if you insist on having a black crew, all of a sudden there`s something wrong."
Robert Klein,"She's stirring the Yankee Bean Soup – which will cause many absences in the afternoon. It's government surplus, stuff that India rejected, and sent back. Powdered eggs, khaki fish – forget it. || And the only studies were - Rodney Dangerfield was my mentor and he was my Yale drama school for comedy. || I was in the De Witt Clinton Hight School marching band. One of the worst bands ever formed. When we played the national anthem, people from every country stood – except Americans. || I was a lifeguard once in the Catskills. Saved a little boy's life. He was a real brat, 9 or 10 years old. His idea of fun was playing catch with farina, tripping the bellhops. The staff couldn't stand him. Then one day against my orders he went to the deep end of the pool. I anticipated it and pulled him out. His parents tipped me $5. Now, what I can't figure out is how did they come up with the figure? How do you tip somebody who saved your son's life? What's the conversation like? The father says: “I don't know, we'll give him $15.” Wife says, “$15, we're not made of money.” “Well,” says the father, “how long have we had the boy? We'll give him $5.” I could have gotten $15 from the staff to let the kid drown! || I have a feeling for obscure, historical characters like James Abram Garfield, who was the 20th President of the U. S. He was a pretty hones Congressman and Senator from Ohio. Elected eight times. Tremendous integrity. Only, the most famous thing he's remembered for is having been shot. And they always say the same thing for who shot him: “a disappointed office seeker.” And sure enough, you look at a child's milk-container collection of the Presidents, you'll see: “George Washington, Father of our Country; Thomas Jefferson, purchased Louisiana; Abraham Lincoln, Emancipation Proclamation; James Garfield, shot by a disappointed office seeker.” Look in an encyclopedia under Garfield, James Abram. It says, see Office Seeker, Disappointed. The office seeker got all the fame! || But I think the other is a little more like bullfighting, a little more daring and although I appreciate good acting and I liked being versatile my whole career, it kept me working. || In the fifties I had dreams about touching a naked woman and she would turn to bronze or the dream about hot dogs chasing donuts through the Lincoln Tunnel. || I had very tough kids when I was a substitute teacher.

No. I had large, formidable – I had murderers in my class. I had one child in the ninth grade who had to take six months off from school for National Guard duty. He was going to junior hight on the GI Bill. || My son has been a class clown and it sort of ran in the family. || But to do it professionally is a quantum leap difference and my father had to be persuaded by these kind of Ivy League professors that I should go to the Yale Drama School, another one of the stories in there. || I do have to fly a lot. It's difficult for me, but I'm not angry about it. But I did see on the menu in Logan Airport, Boston, “Potato salad in season.” || Take a drink from the water fountain. Water's running nice and brown. Tastes like an iron mine. || Nor did anyone censor any of my book. It is the most creative freedom you can have, in this, the 21st century, I can assure you. || I remember they used to give us a speech in the 1950's. “Children, take these dog tags home, make sure the names and addresses are correct in case of a nuclear holocaust. And if there is a nuclear holocaust there'll be no talking during the holocaust!” || One of the gigantic lobsters has demolished our last camera with a single swipe of its horrible claw!

Pass the lunchroom, see the familiar lunchroom lady with the white dress and net on her hair. At the end of 50 years of distinguished service the Board of Education gives her a bronze net – with her name on it. It stems from the Board of Education rule to keep her hair out of the food. || First of all, none of the kids knew what I was, because they'd ask 'what are you, a sub?' Sub is prefix for below. They'd all say sub, sub. I didn't know if I was a ship, a sandwich... || So it took me five years because in the interim I have been doing a lot of personal appearances and movies and some television series that went into the plumbing and I stopped writing for a while. || The `50s were terrifying with nuclear bomb stuff but boring in a social way and then the `60s were happening, and remember, there was no AIDS."

I know where I am, shut the fuck up. || I sit down with my daughter and I said, ""Do you know how babies get here?"" And she said, ""Well, the lady has an egg inside of her, and the man has sperm inside of him, and the sperm meets the egg, and that's how the lady gets pregnant."" And I said, ""Do you know how the sperm meets the egg?"" She said, ""Does the man pee on the woman?"" I said, ""Sometimes, but that's $35 extra."" || Because when you’re laughing, there is no other emotion in that moment except for joy. || Caution: Anal intercourse may lead to irregular heart rhythms. Yeah, you know I'm never gonna have to worry about that. Because God gave me a second lease on life and I'm not gonna press my luck and take it up the ass. || My mom told me when I was younger that when you jack off all of your dead relatives are watching. But then I figured who were they going to tell. || I asked my wife to try anal sex. She said, ""Sure. You first."" || My daughter saw this billboard for this place: 'Swim With the Dolphins.' She goes, 'I wanna do that.' I said, 'It's a lot of money - forget about it.' She said, 'Dad, I always wanted to swim with the dolphins.' 'Always, or since you saw the sign?' || They do sell a lot of weird things in sex shops. They have this stuff called Mr. Big Cream. It says, “Rub it on your dick and your dick gets bigger.” Great. Wouldn’t your hands get bigger too? || A lot of weird ads. Sally Struthers with that little kid: 'Just 55 cents, the price of a cup of coffee, feeds this kid and his family for a week.'

Southwest has a plane that's painted like Shamu the whale from Sea World. Yeah, that'll be easy to find if that went down in the ocean. That'll be nice, when you're trying to get out and a real whale's humping your window. || Why are hemorrhoids called hemorrhoids and asteroids called asteroids? Wouldn't it make more sense if it was the other way around? But if that was true, then a proctologist would be an astronaut. || They do have weird ads. That one with the mother and daughter on the beach - 'Mom, why do they have douche?' Why don't you ask the pelicans that are following you? || So because of my act my daughter thinks she can talk to me about anything. She's been dating the same guy since high school and they go to the same college, and she calls me up one night and says ""Dad, I wanted to talk to you about Steve."" And all I can think is if she tells me she took it up the ass I'm gonna drop dead on the phone. I mean what do you say to that ""Daddy, I don't like it in the butt."" Yeah, you and your mom both. So she says ""Dad, you know Steve and I have been together for a while, and he was wondering what it would be like to go all the way."" So I said ""Maybe I'll fuck him then he won't have to wonder anymore."" See Steve that's what it's like to go all the way... would you stop crying? || It's my mission to try and give people fighting the disease the same gifts of laughter and a positive attitude I had. Hopefully, my career as a comic will give me the forum to touch these people. || You know what's weird about plane crashes is that you watch it on the news and they say the people have to be identified by their dental records. 'Cause if they don't know who you are, how do they know who your dentist is? || One of my friends goes: ""So, you know what really turns me on; when girls talk dirty in bed."" Yeah I tried that with my wife. I said: ""Hey, talk dirty to me."" She said: ""Go fuck yourself"". Not that dirty. || I'm not ready to die. Period. To begin with, I cannot imagine a future without me in it. Can't do it. || When it comes to my wife and blowjobs, my dick’s in the Witness Protection Program. “Dick? I don’t know nobody named Dick.” || What do you say when your friends come to visit and the dog starts humping their leg. Well, if it’s a pit bull, you say, “You better let him finish.” || What is it with the animals with the bikes? I took my daughter to the circus. She said: ""Daddy, how do they teach a bear how to ride a bike?"" I said: It's easy, they nail his feet to the pedals and they beat the shit out of him. He's not riding, he's running. He just happens to be attached to the bike."
Robin Williams,"Marijuana enhances many things, colors, flavors, sensations, but you are certainly not fucking empowered. When you're stoned, you're lucky if you can find your own goddamn feet. The only way it's a performance-enhancing drug is if there's a big fucking Hershey bar at the end of the run. Then you'll be like a Swiss ski jumper going, ""I'm there!"" || Nobody takes a picture of something they want to forget. || I can see it now: Osama bin Laden goes up to the pearly gates where George Washington comes out, starts beating him and is then joined by 70 other members of the Continental Congress.

Remember that. || If you masturbated with your left hand, would it be like being touched by a retarded person? || There have been two different drafts of the script. The hard part about following it up is at the end of the first one, he revealed his identity to his kids. How do you play that out? How does she come back? One of the ideas was that he'd go to New York because his daughter was going to college and he'd be nearby. But as a script, it never worked. || I have one question for the ladies: Do we look like this? || Montovani? They play Montovani to insomniacs that don't respond to strong drugs. || If you can remember the sixties, you weren't there. || Three wishes - no substitutes, exchanges or refunds. || You don't need cocaine!

There's no question this is where I want to live. Never has been. || When you create you get a little endorphin rush. Why do you think Einstein looked like that? || The definition of insanity is repeating the same action expecting a different outcome.

We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering - these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love - these are what we stay alive for. || They tell me now that SpongeBob is gay. SquarePants is not gay. Tight pants maybe. SpongeBob Hot Pants? You go, girl! || I'm sorry, if you were right, I'd agree with you. || Ah... so many pedestrians, so little time... || Carpe per diem - seize the check. || If women ran the world we wouldn't have wars, just intense negotiations every 28 days. || The Statue of Liberty is no longer saying, ""Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses.""

What are we so mortally afraid of? Why can't we treat death with a certain amount of humanity and dignity and decency and, God forbid, maybe even humor. Death is not the enemy, gentlemen.

I think so... look at the platypus. || Real loss is only possible when you love something more than you love yourself. || Self-reliance is the key to a vigorous life.

I'd rather have a lobotomy by a leper. That means something. || They should have little disclaimer that says - ""Do not operate heavy machinery while watching this show!"" || Okra is the closest thing to nylon I`ve ever eaten.

Not good. || In California, we are a sixty percent Hispanic state, we elected an Austrian governor. Even old Nazis are going ""That's weird."" || The moments of comedy are there. But the whole idea of a vacation is the stripping away of stuff and then, by the end of the vacation, at least in my life, you do have these moments as a group, as a family having a great time, so mellow again. It takes a while to do that but that's what this movie is about. || Every human being has an impact on another. || If you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. Go on, lean in. Listen, you hear it? Carpe diem, seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary. || Gradual school is where you go to school and you gradually find out you don't want to go to school anymore. || A woman would never make a nuclear bomb. They would never make a weapon that kills, no, no. They’d make a weapon that makes you feel bad for a while. || It felt wonderful doing it. But that's rather like urinating in brown velvet pants. It can feel wonderful, but no one will watch. || Reality is just a crutch for people who can't cope with drugs. || But only in their dreams can men be truly free It was always thus and always thus will be. || Golf is a game where white men can dress up as black pimps and get away with it. || Without the reality, it's just slamming into things. If you start with that physical comedy, then things surely but slowly fall apart. But you build on that reality and then you can go pretty outrageous - up to the Keaton-like gags. || It has this scope that's outrageous, but yet at the core, these very intimate scenes, so that alone is interesting. || I had a lovely military flight, thank you. I love spiraling in - nothing like that to make your colon go, ""Fire in the hole!"" || After a while, you just kind of chill.

It gives them a fun reason to exercise and learn about geography as well. || We have a president for whom English is a second language. He's like ""We have to get rid of dictators"", but he's pretty much one himself. || Sometimes you've got to specifically go out of your way to get into trouble.

You can't come home drunk and go, ""Hey, here`s a little switch: Daddy's gonna throw up on you!"" || I started doing comedy because that was the only stage that I could find. It was the pure idea of being on stage. That was the only thing that interested me, along with learning the craft and working, and just being in productions with people. || I love running cross country...

My parents sent me to a child psychiatrist. The kid didn't help me at all. || I tell ya when I was a kid, all I knew was rejection. My yo-yo, it never came back! || When I was a kid I got no respect. I told my mother, ""I'm gonna run away from home."" She said, ""On your mark..."" || I joined gamblers anon., they gave me 2 to 1 I wouldn't make it! I joined AA, there was a two drink minimum! || My wife she's fat. Why, if she lost a few pounds, she'd be perfectly round. || That son of mine, when they made him they broke the mold. Then they set it on fire to be sure. || I like to date schoolteachers. If you do something wrong, they make you do it over again. || Last week I was walking by a cemetery, two guys came after me with shovels. It was all about money. || Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it. || When I played in the sandbox, the cat kept covering me up. || I was so depressed that I decided to jump from the tenth floor. They sent up a priest. He said ""On your mark... "" || My kid wants to be a prison warden when he grows up so he can put thumb tacks on the electric chairs. || My wife had her drivers test the other day. She got 8 out of 10. The other 2 guys jumped clear. || I got my first break and became a singing waiter at eighteen or nineteen. I couldn't make a living at it. I quit. Then I got married and sold aluminum siding. My wife had problems physically. It was not good. || I started over again with an image: ""Nothing goes right."" Then when The Godfather came out, all I heard was, ""Show respect. With me, you show respect."" So I changed the image to ""I don't get no respect."" I tried it out in Greenwich Village. I remember the first joke I told: ""Even as a kid, I'd play hide and seek and the other kids wouldn't even look for me."" The people laughed. After the show, they started saying to me, ""Me, too - I don't get no respect."" I figured, let's try it again. || I am the world's oldest teenager. I've never lost my youthful attitude. || He who laughs last didn't get it in the first place. || I remember one date I had, we ran into some guy she knew and she introduced us. She said, 'Steve, this is Rodney. Rodney, this is goodbye.' || My wife's favourite position is back to back. || I asked my wife, 'Is there somebody else?' She said, 'There must be.' || When my wife drives, there's always trouble. The other day she took the car. She came home. She told me, ""There's water in the carburetor."" I asked her, ""Where's the car?"" She said, ""In a lake."" || All my wife and I do is fight about sex. The other night, we really had it out. Well, I'll put it this way - I had it out. || I tell ya, southern people, they always think you are hard-of-hearing. Every timr you leave they say to you, ""You come back, you hear?"" And southern people, they think you are horny too. You get directions, they say, ""Just up the road apiece."" || Women my age just don't turn me on. That's another problem with getting older. I took out an older woman the other night, and I mean old. I told her, ""Act your age."" She died. || I used to date a girl from Buffalo. Why can't I meet a girl with normal parents? || My only thrill is self inflicted hickies. || My sex life is like shooting pool with a rope! || It was the same thing in the army, no respect. They gave me a uniform that glowed in the dark. || My wife has to be the worst cook. I don't believe meatloaf should glow in the dark. || I went to a massage parlor. It was self service. || My cousins gay, he went to London only to find out that Big Ben was a clock. || People seldom live up to their baby pictures. || I tell ya, my wife, we get along good cause we have our own arrangement. I mean, one night a week I go out with the boys and one night a week, she goes out with the boys. || What a childhood I had, why, when I took my first step, my old man tripped me! || With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, ""How can I get my kite in the air?"" He told me to run off a cliff. || I went to look for a used car and found my wife's dress in the back seat. || C is for cookie, it's good enough for me; oh cookie cookie cookie starts with C. || Boy what a hotel that was, why they stole my towel! || I come home from work early one day, and I see a guy jogging down the street in his underwear. I ask him, ""Why are you jogging in your underwear?"" He says, ""You came home from work early"". || It's lonely on the top when there's no one on the bottom. || I was ugly, very ugly. When I was born, the doctor smacked my mother. || I tell ya, my wife was never nice. On our first date, I asked her if I could give her a goodnight kiss on the cheek - she bent over! || I came from a real tough neighborhood. In the library the sign says ""shut the fuck up""! || I asked my wife if she would put out the garbage. she said ""why should I you never put out for me"". || I once had a problem... so I tried group sex. Now I have a new problem - who to thank. || When I was a kid I got no respect. When I went on the roller coaster, my old man told me to stand up straight. || When I was a kid I got no respect. I had no friends. I remember the see-saw. I had to keep runnin' from one end to the other. || When I was a kid I got no respect. I played hide-and-seek. They wouldn't even look for me. || With girls I get no respect. A belly dancer told me I turned her stomach. || Everyone says that looks don't matter, age doesn't matter, money doesn't matter. But I never met a girl yet who has fallen in love with an old ugly man who's broke. || I tell ya, I don't get no respect ... Last week, my wife told me that she was going to cut me down to twice a month. But I thought about it, and I figured that it wasn't too bad. I know a couple of guys that she cut out completely. || My only thrill is self inflicted hickies. || She was so ugly that her face could stop a sundial. || Why, her cooking is so bad that the flies pitched in to fix the screen door. I leave dental floss in the kitchen and watch the roaches hang themselves. || My wife and I have Olympic sex. Once every four years. || With sex my wife thinks twice before she turns me down. Yeah, once in the morning and once at night. || My wife only has sex with me for a purpose. Last night it was to time an egg. || I know the best way to get girls. I hang out at prisons and wait for parolees. || I have nothing but troubles with my car. Every Sunday I take my family out for a push. || I remember one guy gave her a good piece of his mind. Yeah, it was right after she took a good piece of his leg. || This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the fruit-of-the-loom guys laughing at me. || I tell ya, my family were always big drinkers. When I was a kid, I was missing. They put my picture on a bottle of Scotch. || My psychiatrist told me I was crazy and I said I want a second opinion. He said okay, you're ugly too. || I'm very lucky. Years ago they had images, like W.C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx. But today, I think I'm the only one around with an image. And that image is something everyone identified with. They all feel life treated 'em wrong and they got no respect. || When I was born, the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father, ""I'm very sorry. We did everything we could. But he pulled through."" || If things go right, I'll be there about a week, and if things don't go right, I'll be there about an hour and a half. || My friends and I play a new version of Russian roulette, we pass around six girls and one of them has V.D. || My wife is so fat that when she lays on the beach the people feel sorry for her and try to roll her back into the water. || At my age, making love is like trying to shoot pool with a rope. || What a childhood I had, why, when I took my first step, my old man tripped me! || What a dog I got. Last night he went on the paper 4 times - 3 while I was reading it. || It's tough to stay married. My wife says no because she's tired then stays up and reads her book. || She was so fat that when she got on the scale a card came out saying one at a time. || My mother never breast fed me, she told me she only liked me as a friend. || To give you an idea how well I was doing at the time I quit, I was the only one who knew I quit. || There's only one thing wrong with my wife's face - it shows. || I'll tell you one thing, I know how to satisfy my wife in bed, yeah, I leave. || You wanna have laughs? Do what I do. When I go through a tollbooth, I keep going. I tell the guy, ""The car behind me is paying for two."" || I found there was only one way to look thin: hang out with fat people. || I had plenty of pimples as a kid. One day I fell asleep in the library. When I woke up, a blind man was reading my face. || This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the fruit-of-the-loom guys laughing at me. || It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass. || I was so ugly my mother used to feed me with a sling shot. || If it wasn't for pick-pockets I'd have no sex life at all. || My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet. || With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me. || My wife is always trying to get rid of me. The other day she told me to put the garbage out. I said to her I already did. She told me to go and keep an eye on it. || Most of the arguments to which I am party fall somewhat short of being impressive, knowing to the fact that neither I nor my opponent knows what we are talking about. || At twenty a man is full of fight and hope. He wants to reform the world. When he is seventy he still wants to reform the world, but he know he can't. || My wife has cut me down to once a month, I'm lucky I know two guys she cut off completely. || I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out. || Once I pulled a job, I was so stupid. I picked a guy's pocket on an airplane and made a run for it. || When I was kidnapped as a child my parents sent a letter to the hijackers me Pay 5,000 dollars or your back. || Life's a short trip. You'll find out. || For two hours, some guy followed me around with a pooper scooper. || My wife has to be the worst cook. Her specialty is indigestion. || The other night a mugger took off his mask and made me wear it. || She was so fat that she has her own postal code. || Everyone gets their rough day. No one gets a free ride. Today so far, I had a good day. I got a dial tone. || She was so fat that she wears a 'cross your thighs' bra. || She was so fat that when I hit her with my car she asked why I didn't go around her and I said that I didn't think I had enough gas. || I get up and a button falls off, I pick up my briefcase and the handle falls off I'm afraid to go to the bathroom. || Once I opened up a fortune cookie and inside was the guy's cheque next to me I said ""hey buddy I got your cheque"" he said ""thanks"". || They took a survey: ""Why do men get up in the middle of the night?"" Ten percent get up to go to the bathroom and 90 percent get up to go home. || I said to a girl I'd been seeing, ""come home with me, honey, and I'll show you where it's at."" She said, ""You'd better, because the last time I could'nt find it."" || I tell ya, it's tough to save a buck. Right now I'm supporting two fighters. My wife and her mother. || What a doctor I've got - he's really mixed up. Last week, he grabbed my knee and told me to cough. Then hit me in the balls with a hammer. || I tell ya I got a stupid son. That's one load that shoulda been shot on the wall. || She was so ugly that when two men broke into her apartment and she yelled ""rape"" they yelled ""nooooooo"". || A hooker once told me she had a headache. || He found a new way to cover up his bad breath. He holds up his arms. || My wife can't cook at all. She made chocolate mousse. an antler got stuck in my throat. || I tell ya, with my wife, I got no sex life. Her favorite position is facing Bloomingdale's. || My wife and I keep fighting about sex and money. I think she charges me too much. || Last Christmas, in my stocking there was an Odour-Eater. || My wife dresses to kill. She cooks the same way. || If I could have dinner with anyone who lived in the history of the world, who would it be? That depends on the restaurant. || Man, who don't like spaghetti? || When I was a kid I got no respect. My mother breast fed me through a straw. || His breath is so bad why every time he smokes he blow onion rings. || I had this joke: ""I played hide and seek; they wouldn't even look for me"". To make it work better, you look for something to put in front of it: ""I was so poor, I was so dumb"", so this, so that. I thought, ""Now what fits that joke?"" Well, ""No one liked me"" was all right. But then I thought, ""A more profound thing would be, 'I get no respect!' "". || I asked my wife, ""last night, were you faking it?"" She said, ""No, I was really sleeping."" || My old man took me to a freak show. They said, ""Get the kid outta here. He's distracting from the show."" || My wife wants sex in the back of the car and she wants me to drive. || Look out for number one and try not to step in number two. || I came from a real tough neighborhood. In the local restaurant I sat down and had broken leg of lamb. || I'm a bad lover.

As they wheel you in, the doctor always gives you a last look. You know that look. That look of confidence to make you feel good. I always say to every doctor, ""If I don't make it, I'll never know it."" || You live with life's disappointments and learn from them. At seventy-eight, I know it all. || They have the slowest bartender in town. If you ever wanna quit drinkin, ask him for a beer. || Last week I told my wife, ""If you would learn to cook, I could fire the chef."" She said, ""If you could learn to make love, I could fire the chauffer."" || I went to a bar for a few drinks. The bartender asked what I wanted. ""Surprise me"", I said. So he showed me a naked picture of my wife. || My wife says 90% of sex occurs between the ears. But I need a girl who can blow more just my mind. || If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so is ugliness. || I was an ugly kid. When I was born, after the doctor cut the cord, he hung himself. || They change the sheets every day... from one bed to another. || She was so fat that when guys have sex with her they ask for directions. || I asked him, ""Who said you could fool around with my wife?"" He said, ""Everybody."" || My wifes cooking is so bad the flys fix our screens. || Last time I tried to make love to my wife nothing happened, so I said to her, 'What's the matter, you can't think of anybody either?' || I went to a gay bar, they wanted proof of sex so I showed them, they said it wasn't enough. || I'd like to get some new clothes, but I can't find a Big and Short store. || At Christmas time I sat on Santa's lap.

I have sex twice a year. || I could tell my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio. || With girls, I don't think right. I had a date with one girl, she had mirrors all over her bedroom. She told me to come over and bring a bottle. I got Windex. || After I got divorced, I said to myself, I will never, ever get married again. It was in cement. I went through a really rough twenty-five years, but it happened again. I fell in love. I told her, ""Baby, I don't want a prenuptial agreement. This is it."" Everyone told me I was nuts. Well, my new wife and I are married six years and we get along great. You can make anything work if you're both givers. || One night she told me to put out the garbage. I told her ""you cooked it, you take it out"". || I took my son to Coney island, I said ""wanna go in the crazy house?"", he said ""save your money we'll be home soon""! || My cousin is gay; in school while other kids were dissecting frog, he was opening flies. || My wife's so dumb, she got a nail in the spare! || My mom took me to a dog show and I won! || I live in a tough neighborhood.

Then we met. || I'm at the age where I want two girls. In case I fall asleep they will have someone to talk to. || I walked in on my wife and the milkman, the first thing she says is ""don't tell the butcher""! || I know I’m not sexy. In high school I was voted ""Most Likely to Masturbate"". || The sign on the bar said: 'girls- topless, bottomless', I went inside and there was nobody there! || I got myself good this morning too. I did my pushups in the nude; I didn't see the mouse trap. || With my dog I don't get no respect. He keeps barking at the front door. He don't want to go out. He wants me to leave. || I think my wife is cheating on me, the only thing the parrot knows how to say is, ""quick out the window"". || My wife was afraid of the dark... then she saw me naked and now she's afraid of the light. || Sure I smoked pot in hospital. My wife won't let me toke at home. || I've never been lucky. The day my ship came in, I was at the airport. || We lived in a neighborhood that was too rich for us. When I was young, I had to deliver groceries to the homes of the kids I went to school with. I had to go to the back doors to make the deliveries. It was embarrassing.

I've got the only dog who begs for alka-seltzer. || One day as I came home early from work... I saw a guy jogging naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy, why are you doing that?"" He said, ""Because you came home early."" || I saved a girl from being attacked last night. I controlled myself. || I get no respect. The way my luck is running, if I was a politician I would be honest. || At Christmas time we couldn't afford tinsel, so we'd wait till grandpa sneezed. || You know you're old when your family talk about you in front of you.

The refrigerator. || Oh, when I was a kid, I was poor. Christmas, I got no presents. Well, there was one Christmas, on our front lawn - Prancer and Dancer - they dropped off a little something. || A sense of humor is rare. It isn't telling a joke about how there are three ways to get to heaven. It's being in a restaurant and hearing someone say, ""Everyone's got their tale of woe,"" and then turning around and saying, ""Unfortunately, in life, there's more woe than tail."" || I drink too much. The last time I gave a urine sample it had an olive in it. || I don't get no respect, are you kiddin'? The time I got hurt.

Now it's different when I open the door the kids hand me candy. || We were poor. we were so poor, in my neighborhood the rainbow was in black-and-white. || I knew a girl so ugly, she had a face like a saint... a Saint Bernard! || When I was born the doctor took one look at my face, turned me over and said, Look... twins! || I feel sorry for short people, you know. When it rains, they're the last to know. || In my life I've been through plenty. When I was three years old, my parents got a dog. I was jealous of the dog, so they got rid of me. || I came from a real tough neighborhood. On my street, the kids take hubcaps… from moving cars. || I bought a new book, '100 new ways to make love'. I ended up in traction - it was a misprint. || I came from a real tough neighborhood. I bought a waterbed and found a guy at the bottom of it. || I came from a real tough neighborhood. Why, every time I shut the window I hurt somebody's fingers. || When my old man wanted sex, my mother would show him a picture of me. || I had a good time last week. I did a show; the whole audience was midgets. I got a standing ovation - I didn't even know it! || I asked my old man if I could go ice-skating on the lake. He told me, ""Wait til it gets warmer."" || I have three kids, one of each. || I haven't spoken to my wife in years. I didn't want to interrupt her. || I looked up my family tree and found three dogs using it. || Yeah, I know I'm ugly... I said to a bartender, 'Make me a zombie.' He said 'God beat me to it.' || I looked up my family tree and found out I was the sap. || When I was a kid my parents moved a lot, but I always found them. || My mother had morning sickness after I was born. || Acting deals with very delicate emotions. It is not putting up a mask. Each time an actor acts he does not hide; he exposes himself. || Life is just a bowl of pits. || Oh, last week was a rough week. I noticed my gums were shrinking. I was brushing my teeth with Preparation H. || I came from a real tough neighborhood. Once a guy pulled a knife on me. I knew he wasn't a professional, the knife had butter on it. || Men who do things without being told draw the most wages. || Comedy is a camouflage for depression. || My wife has to be the worst cook. In my house, we pray after we eat. || I went to a freak show and they let me in for nothing. || Last week my tie caught on fire, some guy tried to put it out with an axe. || I told my doctor I broke my arm in two places. He told me to keep out of those places. || A homeless guy came up to me on the street, said he hadn't eaten in four days. I told him, ""Man, I wish I had your willpower."" || When I got back into show business in 1961, I felt - for obvious reasons - that nothing in my life went right, and I realized that millions of people felt the same way. So when I first came back my catch phrase was ""nothing goes right."" Early on, that was my setup for a lot of jokes. || I don't get no respect, no respect at all! || One night I came home. I figured, let my wife come on. I'll play it cool. Let her make the first move. She went to Florida. || She was so fat that her belly button makes an echo. || I told him I think my wife has V.D. he gave himself a shot of penicillin. || She failed her drivers test. She couldn't get used to the front seat. It took her four lessons to learn to sit up. || My old man, I told him I'm tired of running around in circles. So he nailed my other foot to the floor. || And I tell ya I got no confidence in the pilot. When he makes a left turn he puts his hand out. || Last Christmas I got no respect. In my stocking, I got an odor-eater. || With my doctor, I don't get no respect. I told him I want a vasectomy. He said with a face like mine, I don't need one. || With my old man I got no respect. When he told me I should start at the bottom. He was teaching me how to swim. || With my old man I got no respect. He told me never take candy from a stranger unless he offered me a ride. || I told my doctor I got water on my knee, he gave me a sponge and raised his fee! || When I was born I brought no joy, my father said he wanted a boy! || I once met a beautiful, proper English girl. I bid her adieu.... she bid me a don't. || She was so fat that she has a dress with a sign on the back that says ""caution wide load"". || The other night I woke up, she was saying sexy things. She was on the phone. || I can't figure women out. They put on makeup for three hours. They wear things that make them smaller. Things that make them bigger. Then they meet a man and they want truth. || I've learned to control everything. I don't get angry at anything. Somebody can do me wrong. That's life. What good is it to get angry? || Hey , I don't get respect from anyone. Why, American Airlines, they thanked me for flying United. || I like southern girls. They talk so slow that by the time they say no, I made it already. || What a dog I got, he found out we look alike, so he killed himself. || I say 'no' to drugs. Whenever someone asks me for some of my drugs I say, 'no.' || I told my dentist my teeth are going yellow. He told me to wear a brown tie. || Why her cooking is so bad that the flies pitched in to fix the screen door. I leave dental floss in the kitchen and watch the roaches hang themselves. || One year they asked me to be poster boy - for birth control. || My marriage is on the rocks again, yeah, my wife just broke up with her boyfriend. || I worked in a pet store and people would ask how big I would get. || My uncle's dying wish - he wanted me on his lap. He was in the electric chair. || With me, nothing goes right. My psychiatrist said my wife and I should have sex every night. Now, we'll never see each other! || I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof. || I told my wife the truth. I told her I was seeing a psychiatrist. Then she told me the truth: that she was seeing a psychiatrist, two plumbers, and a bartender. || I was making love to this girl and she started crying. I said, ""Are you going to hate yourself in the morning?"" She said, ""No, I hate myself now."" || I tell you, I'm not a sexy guy. I was the centerfold for Playgirl magazine. The staples covered everything! || Oh, when I was a kid in show business I was poor, I used to go to orgies to eat the grapes. || Well with girls I don't get no respect. I had a blind date. I waited two hours on the corner. A girl walked by. I said ""Are you Louise?"" She said, ""Are you Rodney?"" I said, ""Yeah."" She said, ""I'm not Louise."" || The shape I'm in, I could donate my body to science fiction. || I told my kids, ""Someday, you'll have kids of your own."" One of them said, ""So will you."" || My wife's a water sign. I'm an earth sign. Together we make mud. || When I go to a nude beach, I always take a ruler, just in case I have to prove something. || I come from a stupid family. During the civil war my great uncle fought for the West. || I don't get no respect. I called Suicide Prevention. They tried to talk me into it. || Last week my house was on fire. My wife told the kids, 'Be quiet, you'll wake up Daddy'. || I'm at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life. In fact, I've just had a mirror put over my kitchen table. || I told my psychiatrist that everyone hates me. He said I was being ridiculous - everyone hasn't met me yet. || I met the surgeon general - he offered me a cigarette. || What a dog I got, his favorite bone is in my arm. || I knew a girl so ugly that she was known as a two-bagger. That's when you put a bag over your head in case the bag over her head breaks. || When you walk up five flights of stairs at four in the morning, there's definitely a hooker involved."
Roseanne Barr,"Chili represents your three stages of matter: solid, liquid, and eventually gas. || You may marry the man of your dreams, ladies, but fourteen years later you're married to a couch that burps. || Since I had my gastric bypass surgery in 1998, I eat like a bird. Unfortunately, that bird is a California condor. || It's okay to be fat. So you're fat. Just be fat and shut up about it. || The thing women have yet to learn is nobody gives you power. You just take it. || I hate every human being on earth. I feel that everyone is beneath me, and I feel they should all worship me. That's what I told my kids. I think I must have been Adolf Hitler in a past life. || I consider myself to be a pretty good judge of people... that's why I don't like any of them. || Sometimes for me not throwing a tantrum is what running a marathon or swimming the English Channel must be like for others of a less-challenging emotional nature. || A guy is a lump like a doughnut. So, first you gotta get rid of all the stuff his mom did to him. And then you gotta get rid of all that macho crap that they pick up from beer commercials. And then there's my personal favorite, the male ego. || Finding a calm place inside myself through meditation kind of helped me to get over a lot of mental illness, it's just been a really great thing in my life. || I had left home like all Jewish girls in order to eat pork and take birth control pills. When I first shared an intimate evening with my husband I was swept away by the passion (so dormant inside myself) of a long and tortured existence. The physical cravings I had tried so hard to deny finally and ultimately sated... but enough about the pork. || Women complain about PMS, but I think of it as the only time of the month when I can be myself. || As a housewife, I feel that if the kids are still alive when my husband gets home from work, then hey, I've done my job. || Women should try to increase their size rather than decrease it, because I believe the bigger we are, the more space we'll take up, and the more we'll have to be reckoned with. || I know how to do anything, I'm a mom. || Take this marriage thing seriously - it has to last all the way to the divorce. || Excuse the mess but we live here. || To expect life to treat you good is foolish as hoping a bull won't hit you because you are a vegetarian. || My daughter made me a Jerry Springer-watching kit, with crackers, Cheez Whiz, polyester stretch pants and a T-shirt with two fat women fighting over a skinny guy. || I'm never going to get married again. Three strikes you're out. I think if I would try to get married again in California I have to go to prison don't I? I think you only get three. || The quickest way to a man's heart is through his chest. || The world makes you into a bitch, no matter how quietly you go, so you may as well go kicking and screaming. || US needs to fix up it's election system so that votes are fairly counted, and the Electoral College is removed. || Patriarchy is impotent and qualitatively unable to solve even the most simple problems in the cosmos such as picking up their own socks or placing a carton of milk back in the refrigerator after drinking from it. || Legalize hemp and allow women to grow it and make food, clothing and housing for pennies from it and legalize marijuana too. Let women integrate their divided consciousness with a natural herb instead of doctors' pills that kill the liver. || I will outlaw bullshit. After the passage of this law the patriarchy will inevitably start to crumble as will the concept of war itself which is largely a large load of bullshit. || Somewhere within the concept of justice, the worst of the guilty must always be removed. I cannot divorce this, not completely. The people must have justice and so I want to reinstate and enshrine the blessed and holy guillotine! || Just ten of the Jewish billionaires on this earth have more than enough to transform the occupied territories into heaven. We can put the 'pal' back in Palestinian. || In the new world every position of power evacuated by an arrested and beheaded pedophile or bankster will be filled with a grandmother who has pledged to create heaven on earth for all children, animal and humans with the stolen money we have recovered. || ACORN is organizing to make sure the job of rebuilding New Orleans is done by the people of New Orleans and truly benefits the communities who have been hurt the most. || I'm only upset that I'm not a widow. || I have five kids from three marriages. I come from a trailer park. My sister and brother are both gay. I have multiple personalities. || There isn't any ""New Man"". The New Man is the old man, only he whines more. || Well it`s been a few years now and I`ve done some crazy stuff, you know... but I reconnected with what made me famous, with that show and that family, and I went back to my stand-up where I can be myself completely. || Experts say you should never hit your children in anger. When is a good time? When you're feeling festive? || My husband and I didn't sign a pre-nuptial agreement. We signed a mutual suicide pact. || This producer was a woman, a type I became acquainted with at the beginning of my stand-up career in Denver. I cared little for them: blondes in high heels who were so anxious to reach the professional level of the men they worshipped, fawned over, served, built up, and flattered that they would stab other women in the back. They are the ultimate weapon used by men against actual feminists who try to work in media, and they are never friends to other women, you can trust me on that. || I'm not going to vacuum 'til Sears makes one you can ride on. || The fact that my grown kids like to hang out with me, I mean, it just - I don't think it really can get any better than that, I don't think. || I'm a comic, and I'm supposed to outrage and make people laugh. Part of makin' people laugh is to shake up their thinkin'. That's what I came here to do. || There's a lot more to being a woman than being a mother, but there's a hell of a lot more to being a mother than most people suspect. || I was completely nuts for most of my life. || My hope is that gays will be running the world, because then there would be no war. Just a greater emphasis on military apparel. || I survived my childhood by birthing many separate identities to stand in for one another in times of great stress and fear. || There's nothing like a hardship song to set my toes a-tappin. || The one who cares the most wins. That's how I knew I'd end up with everyone else waving the white flags and not me. That's how I knew I'd be the last person standing when it was all over. I cared the most. ||  Romney's solution for job creation: allow the slave class to employ their fellow slaves!  || I always felt that it was easier to take a funny person and teach them to write television than to take somebody who was a television writer and make them funny. || I had one kid with the birth control pill, I had one with the diaphram and I had one with the I.U.D. I don’t even know what happened with my I.U.D. It never came out. But I have my suspicions because that kid picks up HBO. || My husband and I didn't sign a pre-nuptial agreement. We signed a mutual suicide pact. || Birth control that really works - every night before we go to bed we spend an hour with our kids. || 'Winning' in Hollywood means not just power, money, and complimentary smoked-salmon pizza, but also that everyone around you fails just as you are peaking. || I thank God for creating gay men. Because if it wasn't for them, us fat women would have no one to dance with. || In Tulsa, restaurants have signs that say, ""Sorry, we're open.'' || Why have I been chosen to deliver the message of female intelligence and its divinity to a deaf world of males? I have asked my god that question and She answered, 'Hey, why not you Roseanne?' Indeed, why not each of us? || Third party: a party which includes all other parties! || Women are cursed, and men are the proof. || I loved work and I loved pouring myself into the work, you know. It was the real life that I had trouble with. || Beauty comes in all sizes, not just size 5. || I have a huge crush on President George W. Bush. I saw him at a recent fundraiser, and he`s a babe. He`s got that Ronald Reagan charm. I think he`s hot. I respect his wife, but if he wasn`t married I`d be putting on my cowboy boots and coming around. || My husband said he needed more space. So I locked him outside. || I used to want to be a movie star so I wouldn`t have to live in trailers anymore. And now that I make movies, I spend a lot of my life living in trailers. || Men read maps better than women because only men can understand the concept of an inch equaling a hundred miles. || Everything that`s written about me has such a negative taint. It just has a life of its own, like an avalanche, and I don`t think there`s anything I can do to stop it. || They're all mine... Of course, I'd trade any one of them for a dishwasher. || Let's take back the real estate between our ears and get green like a son of a bitch. || Any Hamas or Zionist type who tries to interfere with the labor unions and grab the money will be marched to the guillotines and subsequently beheaded. And isn't that easier and more productive than some endless, bloody conflict? So sayeth the gospel of common sense. Happy Mother's Day. || As Prime Minister of Israel I will introduce a bill into the Knesset that will simply pay the Arabs not to shoot at the Jews. || If you spend all your time worrying about dying, living isn't going to be much fun. || In America, if we're speaking truth, women are called bitches. I seek next Mother's Day a march of one million American bitches who can get the job done, the job of getting the food to the hungry and thereby saving our rich American friends and neighbors from going straight to hell and burning there for all of eternity. || The most out-there thing I’m saying is, ‘Don’t have babies. Don’t get married and have kids. Have a larger life than that.' || I hate the word housewife; I don't like the word home-maker either. I want to be called Domestic Goddess. || Vote for me. I’m not a liar. I’m not a thief. I’m not a whore. And I’m not a politician. I think that uniquely qualifies me to become president of the U.S. || I simply care nothing for any of your religions, as all three are fundamentally flawed, unlike the Church of Common Sense, right from the start! They call God he instead of she and all three would like to burn me at the stake for saying that! || Why have I been chosen to deliver the message of female intelligence and its divinity to a deaf world of males? I have asked my god that question and She answered: ""Hey, why not you Roseanne?"" Indeed, why not each of us? || TV family sitcoms have always been about fathers who know best and mothers who are so enchanted with everything they do. I wanted to be the first mom to be a mom on TV. I wanted to sent out a message about how us women really feel. || We never get sick of each other. That's how sick we are. || I'm funnier now because I'm braver and less full of hate, so everything is even more ridiculous than it was before. || This town is a back-stabbing, scum-sucking, small-minded town, but thanks for the money. || As long as your abuser has you scared, you will stay in the cycle of abuse. Thinking of solutions helps you to escape. || People say to me, “You’re not feminine.” Well, they can just suck my dick."
Sam Kinison,"How does a guy look at another guy's hairy ass, and find love? || The Police report said they stabbed this guy 51 times, bludgeoned him in the head with a heavy object 13 times and they shot him twice, so I figure this guy's by the door on the way out going, ""You don't have to leave yet, do you? You haven't shoved a chainsaw up my ass yet! My head's still on my torso! I'm glad you fuckers can handle your high!"" || Jim Bakker. He's lost everything, he's ruined. And the worst thing of all he still has to wake up to her! || In the last couple of years, I guess I've spent six figures on clothes. I figure I spend a lot of time shopping. Eight to ten days a month, I go out and buy. Yeah, I guess you could say that I'm a real clothes whore. || I guess they're tough jokes. But there's lots of things you either laugh or cry at. And you just can't cry. || Folks, I've been straight for seventeen days... Not all in a row. || I have lived a carnal life. My view of life is 'If you're going to miss Heaven, why miss it by two inches? Miss it!' I don't have to go through the thing of paying for it in the next life. I know I'm screwed in the next life. || Rock Against Drugs, what a name. Somebody was high when they came up with that title. It's like Christians Against Christ. Rock created drugs. || You gotta keep falling in love. You gotta believe in it. What are you going to do... give sheep the vote? || There's always 30 or 40 Christians standing around, saying, ""It's a shame that he has to die."" And Jesus is saying, ""Well, maybe I wouldn't have to if somebody would get a ladder and pair of pliers!!"" || Jesus had a tough life. I read about that guy. Jesus is the only guy that ever came back from the dead that didn't scare the fuck out of everybody! || Every generation has someone who steps outside the norm and offers a voice for the unspeakable attitudes of that time. I represent everything that's supposed to be wrong, everything that's forbidden. || You don't know what a rough crowd is. If all I have to do is go make people laugh, that's nothing. Let me tell you what a tough crowd is. A tough crowd is going to a morning service and you got six people there and you gotta pat your house payment. That's a tough crowd. || If I get married again, I want a guy there with a drum to do rimshots during the vows. || I called a detox center - just to see how much it would cost: $13,000 for three weeks! My friends, if you can come up with thirteen grand, you don't have a problem yet. || You know what the problem is with world hunger? We've been sending them food. || I'm like anyone else on the planet; I'm very moved by world hunger. I see the same commercials, those little kids starving and very depressed. I watch these things on TV and I see those commercials. And I look at it and I think, 'God how cruel, to see a little kid out there.' And I go, 'Fuck, I know the film crew could give this kid a sandwich.' You know that kid's not out there filming a letter from home with a Betamax. You know there's a director five feet away going, 'Don't feed him yet. Get that sandwich out of here. Doesn't work unless he looks hungry.' || I just got shot in the ass with an infected load of semen! Who's the smart-ass? || We don't want to drink and drive... But there's no other way to get the fucking car back to the house! How are we supposed to get fucking home? || Have you seen those guys in the malls with the strollers, with that look on their face like they envy the dead? 'Somebody shoot me! This isn't the mall! I'm in Hell!' || There’s a way of transferring funds that is even faster than electronic banking. It’s called marriage. || I hate the fuckin' gall of these countries, that come to us, a week after the war, and go, ""Hey. Can you help us out? Our cities are all fucked up, our highways are destroyed, our economy's shit, the people are wounded, they're outta work..."" Yeah, that's basically what we wanted to do to you... And that's what we wouldn't have had to do to you if you'd just pulled your fuckin' troops out of Kuwait, instead of setting those 700 oil wells on fire, and dumpin' oil in the ocean and poisoning the fish. So fuck you; eat your poisoned fish, breathe your black air, and kiss my American ass! || Lick the alphabet. It makes you appear creative, it's an easy diagram to remember, it's like ""aaaaa.... beeeee.... ceeee."" She's thinking you're from fuckin' Europe or something: ""Oh God, where'd you learn that, oh,"" and you're going ""A, B, C, D, E, F, G"". || John Goodman isn't fat. He's in a category beyond fat. What does one call it? Whalelike. || The Russians haven't been to the moon. You know why? Because they're space pussies... You really want to impress us? Bring us back our flag! || My favorite president, John F. Kennedy. Charming guy, great president. Fucked Marilyn Monroe. President of the United States and fucked Marilyn Monroe. What do you want?! I know some people give him shit about that, yeah like you wouldn't have. No you'd have been too busy studying the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. Yeah you wouldn't have wanted a piece of Marilyn, not you, no. Yeah you're too patriotic, fuck you, you'd have done her. You'd have been just like JFK. You'd have been there in the Oval Office, Marilyn across the desk, your dick up her ass, lookin' out at the Washington Monument going: ""You know, it doesn't get much better than this, does it? President of the United States. Dick in Marilyn Monroe. My finger on the fucking button telling the fucking Russians to get their missiles out of Cuba in twelve hours. It doesn't get better than this."" || You lying whore! You used me! You never loved me! I hope you slide under a gas truck and taste your own blood! Die! Die! Die! I want my records back! I want my fucking records back! || Kurds are the most fucked people on Earth. You know that. They might as well change their name to the Fucks, 'cause they're fucked. ""We used to be the Kurds, now we're the Fucks!"" || I don't worry about terrorism. I was married for two years. || That's when you know you're pretty fucked up, when it makes sense to fall asleep... I was driving between Needles and Barstow... It's about 120 miles of desert... It's four in the morning, man... Hey, this is a pretty good time to go to sleep... So I totaled this fuckin' car out, man!... I fuckin' totaled it! And it made sense at the time! || It was like going to church, except Ozzy Osbourne was there. || I'm not worried about Hell. I was married for two fucking years! Hell would be like Club Med! || I look for women I know are gonna bust me up good. Come on, man, who can resist that? Who can resist that emotional pain? Yeah, they all have the same line, they're so sweet: ""I'm not gonna hurt you like all the others. Really I'm not. I'm gonna introduce you to a whole new level of pain!"" || Well, life was tough, but at least I was able to live it out and I was able to face death and not be afraid. Well, now I'm ready to go to Heaven and be with Jesus, and... hey? Hey, what's this? Oh, God it feels like a man's dick in my ass! Oh, God! I'm dead! Oh, you mean life keeps on fucking you even after you're dead? Oh, it never ends! || There's no happy ending to cocaine. You either die, you go to jail, or else you run out. || I do love women. I don’t think they get enough sexual attention. Guys aren't as in touch with that until they've been married a couple of times. After my second divorce, I said, “Hey, I bet if I learned how to fuck really good I won’t have to give away everything I own every five fucking years!"
Sandra Bernhard,"I'm very much a humanist. I'm very much pro-choice. I'm very much politically correct. || I'm sure that Jesus was an incredible person. || To me, the most important thing in this age is just to let people be. || It's usually a spiritual thing that's preventing somebody from having happiness. || This person at the next table is a fabulous drag queen. I didn't get it until I just looked up. || Purim, one of my favorite holidays. It's like the original drag queen's holiday. It's when all the Jewish men go for it and feel no guilt for a change. || I think I've drawn from some of the most feminine women, like Jackie Kennedy. I am totally devastated that she's gone. She had it all. || It's up to couples, to individuals, to have a trust between each other. || I really, really love Hilary Clinton. I think she's very cool. She's out there and she's involved. || I like the energy of live performance. || I don't like surgery. I don't like elective surgery, I don't like surgery that you have to have. || I don't consider myself a comic but a performer. A comic tells bad jokes. || Gayness is a non-issue. || Anything that has cynicism to it and that's jaded is smutty. || I don't believe in karma. || I've always been opposed to groups. I can't believe the doctrine of group is going to work for every single person within the group. || Everybody has their own way of tapping into their realness. || My father was a proctologist; my mother was an abstract artist. That's how I view the world. || I'm studying Kabbalah, which is really the essence of Jewish spirituality. || That disturbs people when they know they didn't have the guts or integrity to stick to their dreams. || Smut, if it's really smut, there's nothing backing it up. It's the easy way out. || Love is the only shocking act left on the face of the Earth. || I really have a problem with any kind of drug, I always have. || I can't tell you 100 percent what makes a relationship work. But I can see something good coming and I can see something bad coming. || Ellen's very mad at me. She's says if I want to start a war in the press, she's not the person to start with. || Of course, everybody's family is dysfunctional - we've accepted that. What are we supposed to do? Hate our parents for the rest of our lives? || You have to take the basics of feminism and the kind of outline of it and do what you do with it. You have to make things work for your own life. || When you're collaborating with somebody who's got a lot of stuff they haven't worked out yet, you're working out their vision as well. || When you have a knowledge of history, it's very soothing. When there's continuity in your life, it's soothing. || There are so few women in general who aren't completely threatened and confused by other women's success. It's very disappointing. || At some point, the pride has to be a part of the whole day-to-day oeuvre. It's part of who you are and doesn't need to be discussed anymore. || I'm not saying I'm some high priestess. I do things, I'm sure, that are damaging, but it's certainly not on purpose. || I've always gotten myself overly involved in supporting other women who've not always been as supportive in return. || I'll take on somebody if they're offending the entire culture, not just offending me. || I'm the only actress in Hollywood who didn't pay to have these lips. || At no time do I come from a cynical point of view. I'm coming from a concerned point of view. || For most of my relationships, I would have liaisons, and I would feel guilty. || If you want to dig, if you want to pry, do it on your time, but I'm going to be a woman of dignity. || Hip doesn't really come into play anymore as far as I can tell. || How far can we go? How much can we absorb and still have some peace of mind? || I believe in people living their lives and having privacy. || You reach a certain point in your 30s when you say things in a much safer way. || New York has always been a sense of eclectic kind of freedom and expression on a lot of different levels. || It's nobody's business how you do something. || I don't take things so personally in this business anymore. || I think comedy is definitely a more male oriented field - social commentary, political commentary - I think it's just easier for men to get up and say whatever they want. But I don't think there's that many women who really want to put their toe in the water either. It's not the easiest life or lifestyle to get out there and kind of shake the shit up. || I didn't belong when I was in high school. Now people are trying to buy lips. || I tend to go against the grain because when I start to see that everybody's trying to shock, I try not to. I just do stuff that's subtler, more emotional, and I think that shocks people. || I think people are a little bit intimidated by me. You know, I'm not exactly a wilting flower, so I think they're a little bit scared of me sometimes. || I'm trying to appeal to the disenfranchised everybody, not just specifically gay. || The real terrorist threats are George W. Bush and his band of brown-shirted thugs. || If I've learned anything in my 30s, it's about holding back a little bit. || I definitely want to be with somebody who doesn't feel lost or in my shadow. || I don't need to be redundant to the gay community about what's wrong and what isn't happening for them. || I like doing new material in LA. It's very challenging. || I would be dishonorable in a relationship because I wasn't getting what I wanted from that person. || I'm somebody who can absorb a lot. || Gay men, if they've been straight and turn gay, they're gay, honey. || In the late '60s and '70s, when feminism was on the up sweep, there was an awareness of things that we're losing again. || Kids need to be educated about sex and sexuality and if they're going to have sex, learn how to protect themselves and not get pregnant. || Once you're heterosexual and comfortable with that, you don't need to take out an announcement every day. || Gay pride's beautiful. If somebody needs to be expressing that, then it's a positive thing. || Onstage, I'm still wearing my fabulous, sheer dresses because I'm not that big. || The fumes are killing us, and we wonder why things are going haywire. || There will come a day when Anne Heche will be straight again. || I hate to judge everybody across the board. || They want families to come to New York and go to the theater, so the theater is all geared toward family entertainment. It's money, you know. || I get happier every day. I have a sense of accomplishment every day of my life. || I don't want someone coming in and passing judgment on my life. || I'm very much an optimist. I don't think I could do my work if I didn't believe there was some kind of hope for humanity. || I've become this sort of icon for the gay community. I don't like the position. || There are few performers who would have had the audacity to even bring up the fact that they had been poorly reviewed. || I am always hoping to do another CD. This atmosphere has been difficult. || Unfortunately, most college kids these days aren't coming from any place - they seem to ask the same kind of questions over and over again. || My family wasn't the Brady Bunch. They were the Broody Bunch. || Things are so scary and intimidating with AIDS and the right wing that people are looking for somebody to just give them safe harbors. || There's this whole sense of judgment and who's right and who's wrong and who's moral and who's going to be punished. || When people pay to see you live, they connect with you on a much deeper level than people who just buy your records. || When you're constantly looking for things from other people, you're not looking within yourself. || When you're watching the news, how many days in a row can you watch that and feel good about yourself and the world? || I try to avoid people's eyes because I don't like to get that intimate with just anybody. i don't need the responsibility. || On one side you have book burners, Congressional wives and Pat Robertson. On the other side, you have vulgar comedians, foul-mouthed rap groups and Dennis Hopper - all your choices should be so easy. || A remembrance can mean nothing to the one remembered; it can only remind the ones left behind how little they did while you were still alive. || If you close your eyes, you could just as well imagine me to be vintage Ali MacGraw, circa 1968. || Madonna's got one big choice. Take a couple of years off and become a human being. || Growing up in the '60s and the '70s, things certainly seemed more simplistic and easier to digest. || If you come home to a household of chaos and anger and fear, you're not going to feel protected from the world."
Shelley Berman,"If you've never met a student from the University of Chicago, I'll describe him to you. If you give him a glass of water, he says, ""This is a glass of water. But is it a glass of water? And if it is a glass of water, why is it a glass of water?"" And eventually he dies of thirst. || Unquestionably, standup comedy is and has always been an art form. || As a culture I see us as presently deprived of subtleties. The music is loud, the anger is elevated, sex seems lacking in sweetness and privacy. || I was an actor before becoming a comedian. || I am careful with my material and presentation. || I am in the Master of Professional Writing program teaching Humor Writing, Literary and Dramatic. || I believe it is important for comedians to know who came before them. || I will always love to perform standup comedy. || A prominent Los Angeles psychiatrist told a patient: “Ridiculous that you should still be frightened of thunder at your age. Thunder is a mere natural phenomenon. Now the next time it storms and you hear a couple of claps of thunder, just do as I do – put your head under a pillow and stuff your ears until the thunder goes away.” || The moon looks upon many night flowers; the night flowers see but one moon. || A hotel is a place that keeps the manufacturers of 25-watt bulbs in business. || I quit smoking well over twenty years ago. || Outside came in '60. The Edge in '61. All three made Gold, but the biggest seller was Inside. || The Steve Allen Sunday night show had the right to two options after my first performance. || The most memorable performance was my appearance in concert in Carnegie Hall. The first standup to do so. || My first job was at a Chicago night club called Mr. Kelly's. || So that this thing that aired in 1963 would result a few years later in personal bankruptcy, would result in having people be on edge with me, wondering when I'm going to blow up. || While you're improvising, you may come up with something which will break him up. As soon as that smile comes out, you know that, hey, we're having fun. || Few, very few, will ever be able to craft a joke as beautifully as Pat. He was able to just make it all happen. I don't think he was great at telling them, but he was sure great at putting them down. || Today`s audiences are different only insomuch as today`s people are different, and I do not think today`s people are substantially different. || But, let`s face it, I`m a Chicago boy. || As much experience, education and awareness as one can attain is important for a comedian. || Incidentally, I'm still looking for acting work, my first love. || I heard the other day of a man who paid a psychologist $50 to cure him of an inferiority complex – and later was fined $25 and costs for talking back to a traffic cop. || A timid gray-haired lady boarded a Philadelphia local at Trenton and asked the conductor, “Does this train stop at the Broad Street terminal?” “If it doesn't lady,” he assured her, “you're going to see one heck of a crush!” || The old problems - love, money, security, status, health, etc. - are still here to plague us or please us. || Items I noticed on a recent cross-country tour: Ad in a Louisville newspaper: “for sale cheap - my son's collection of bebop and rock and roll records. If a 14-year-old's voice answers the phone, hang up and call later”. A sign on a runway at the Great Lakes naval station: “Absolutely no flying permitted over nudist camp 6.4 miles SSW on a true course of 167 degrees.” Item in an Indianapolis newspaper: “Miss Jan Carr was overcome by gas while taking a bath. She owes her life to the watchfulness of the janitor in her apartment.” Ad in classified column of a University of Cincinnati medical journal: “Will the person who stole the jar of alcohol from Room 303 kindly return my uncle's appendix? No questions asked.” || I know a husband whose neighbour boasted, “I got a cute little red sports car for my wife yesterday.” “Gosh,” sighed my friend, “I wish I could make a trade like that.” || The most unusual salesman I ever met is a fellow who made a modest fortune purveying lightning rods. But he suddenly lost interest in his work. He got caught in a storm with a bunch of samples in his arms. || I developed several comedy phone calls. || My whole act is confession."
Sinbad,"We ask for way too much stuff - way too much stuff. You got a job making $100 a year and bought a house for $3 million. Talking about, 'I don't know what happened with the payment.' || You keep asking me questions that you know I have to lie at. 'Do I look fat?' 'Nah, no.' If you wasn't fat, you wouldn't have asked. That's why you asked the question. Skinny people don't say, 'Do I look fat?' Skinny people say, 'Do you want to eat? Would you like to have a sandwich?' || The world's gone crazy. You got people mad that we got a black president, but he's half white. We claimed our half; y'all get yours. There's some for everybody. He's got some for everybody. || I'm under stress. They killed me on wikipedia. They killed me. And I didn't stay dead long enough to sell no DVDs. I didn't even stay dead long enough - I was too stupid. I should've stayed low. I should've laid low. I could've been gone for a year; I'd have made money. And then I'd have risen from the dead. || But I said wait a minute, I'm going to get a computer, I can do this as well as anybody else. So I did some studying so I knew what kind of boards to get to put a PC together. But there was a guy sitting there with Apple. I said, 'what's that?' and he goes, 'Apple with 128k, it's all built into the box,' and I bought it. That was my first computer. || Here's the thing about Apple, we complain and they give us more battery life. We complain and they'll give us more stuff. Everything's beta right now. Everything's experimental. They really don't know what people want. || If you're not happy before you're successful, you're going to be miserable when you do become successful because all your problems just get magnified. || Black people start making money and want to do stuff we would never do, want to climb mountains. It's right there - you ain't got to climb it, you got a house. Why you gotta go outside and climb a rock? || How you gonna have racism in a country that don’t belong to nobody… Ain’t nobody belong here. You got people going “Go home!” You go home too. You ain’t from here. Go home. || I was in the Air Force and was a boom operator (in-flight refueling). I got my comedy start in the Air Force. || We all want something else other than what we have and don't realize what you got works. It works. It does work. You gotta work. Marriage is work. Marriage is a career. It's not an adventure. || If you say 'why not?,' that applies to everything: 'Why don't I jump off a mountain, wearing just a towel, and see if I make it? Why not?' || You go to McDonalds, they don’t even have numbers on the cash register no more. Got pictures of food. If you know what a french fry look like, you become the manager. You the smartest one there. || Don't let people treat you like you're stupid. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. || Men can’t buy makeup. So they have to buy something else. It’s called a Porsche. || If you got a name like Barack Obama, you're supposed to fight."
Steve Martin,"It is not the big events that hurt the most but rather the smallest questionable shift in tone at the end of a spoken word that can plow most deeply into the heart. || There was a time in my life when I was very interested in relationship psychology. Relationships end, but they don't end your life. But people do often spending more time finding out about failed relationships than finding successful ones. || She had the personality of a ZIP code in Kansas. || This film is only for Madagascar and Iran, neither of which follow American copyright law. || I'm surprised even now that I was aware of things like that at that age. I don't know why. But I decided I would just rather not do them. So I quit for a while. || And now, I'm pleased to introduce the star of the film Gladiator, and a man I like to call a close, personal friend, but he told me not to... || Be undeniably good. || Some nights, alone, he thinks of her, and some nights, alone, she thinks of him. Some night these thoughts, separated by miles and time zones, occur at the same objective moment, and Ray and Mirabelle are connected without ever knowing it. || It's not what you know, it's what you think you know. || His view of the world is one that keeps his blood pressure low, sweeping the cholesterol from his relaxed, freeway-sized arteries. Everyone knows he is going to live till age ninety, although the question that goes begging is, ""for what?"" || All of a sudden I had to remember some words that Marlowe had told me over fifteen years ago: ""Dead men don't wear plaid."" Hmm... Dead men don't wear plaid. I still don't know what it means.  || It takes time though for owners and trainers to invest that additional purse money to start cultivating that better racing product. || It's almost as if someone took a saltine cracker, crumbled it and threw it in the air. These casinos were barges, on the water, and they were destroyed. || The overhead lights reflect in the glass countertop and mingle in the gray and black of the gloves, resulting in a mother-of-pearl swirl that sometimes sends Mirabelle into a shallow hypnotic dream. || The operation was a success, but I'm afraid the doctor is dead. || There's a point when you're famous and it's unbearable to go out because you're too famous. And there's a moment when you're famous just right. || Come on, let's sing one of the old tunes. ""When you're sliding into home and your pants are full of foam, Diarrhea."" || Through the years, I have learned there is no harm in charging oneself up with delusions between moments of valid inspiration. || I guess I wouldn't believe in anything anymore if it weren't for my lucky astrology mood watch. || ...you're nuts but you're welcome here. || He doesn't understand the subtleties of slights and pains, that it is not the big events that hurt the most but rather the smallest questionable shift in tone at the end of a spoken word that can plow most deeply into the heart. || They're going to ask those questions. || Hello. I'm hello, and I'd like to say myself. || Comedians don`t get Oscars, so I gave up on that a long time ago. And I can`t really speak about the Oscar-worthiness of my own performance. || I've got to keep breathing. It'll be my worst business mistake if I don't. || Hold it El Guapo! Or I'll pump you so full of lead you'll be using your dick for a pencil! || You want to know how I think art should be taught to children? Take them to a museum and say, ""This is art, and you can't do it."" || Despite a lack of natural ability, I did have the one element necessary to all early creativity: naïveté, that fabulous quality that keeps you from knowing just how unsuited you are for what you are about to do. || Only then does he realize what he has done to Mirabelle, how wanting a square inch of her and not all of her has damaged them both, and how he cannot justify his actions except that, well, it was life. || I love money. I love everything about it. I bought some pretty good stuff. Got me a $300 pair of socks. Got a fur sink. An electric dog polisher. A gasoline powered turtleneck sweater. And, of course, I bought some dumb stuff, too. || It's so hard to believe in anything anymore. I mean, it's like, religion, you really can't take it seriously, because it seems so mythological, it seems so arbitrary... but, on the other hand, science is just pure empiricism, and by virtue of its method, it excludes metaphysics. I guess I wouldn't believe in anything anymore if it weren't for my lucky astrology mood watch. || She has learned that her body is precious and it mustn't be offered carelessly ever again, as it holds a direct connection to her heart. || The banjo is such a happy instrument - you can't play a sad song on the banjo - it always comes out so cheerful. || Into the mud, scum queen! || We've had some fun tonight... considering we're all gonna die someday. || Now let's repeat the non-conformists' oath: I promise to be different! (audience repeats) I promise to be unique! (audience repeats) I promise not to repeat things other people say! (audience repeats, laughs) Good! || And don't forget to fasten your condoms! Seatbelts, I mean seatbelts.  || You know, a lot of people come to me and they say, ""Steve, how can you be so fucking funny?"" There's a secret to it, it's no big deal. Before I go out, I put a slice of bologna in each of my shoes. So when I'm on stage, I feel funny. || Yeah, I remember when I had my first beer. || It’s not the size of the nose that matters, it’s what’s inside that counts. || I started a grease fire at McDonald's - threw a match in the cook's hair. || Lord loves a workin' man; don't trust whitey. || I believe that sex is one of the most beautiful, natural, wholesome things that money can buy. || There's a big difference between the National Book Awards and the Academy Awards. At the Academy Awards you can feel the greed and envy and ego. Whereas the National Book Awards are in New York. || Chaos in the midst of chaos isn't funny, but chaos in the midst of order is. || Always do business as if the person you're doing business with is trying to screw you, because he probably is. And if he's not, you can be pleasantly surprised. || The emotions of men, however, were of a different order. They were pesky annoyances, small dust devils at her feet. Her knack for causing heartbreak was innate, but her vitality often made people forgive her romantic misdeeds. || I have found that - just as in real life - imagination sometimes has to stand in for experience. || First the doctor told me the good news: I was going to have a disease named after me. || I think I did pretty well, considering I started out with nothing but a bunch of blank paper. || You know ""that look"" women get when they want sex? Me neither. || I like a woman with a head on her shoulders. I hate necks. || I'm a bitter, sad, sour young man who makes a career out of hastling people with real careers. || The real joy is in constructing a sentence. But I see myself as an actor first because writing is what you do when you are ready and acting is what you do when someone else is ready. || I think when the movie `Roxanne' came out, which I also had written, I felt something new that I never felt, which was respect. || I'm happy with how the day has gone and we've made positive steps forward each time I've gone out. My lap times have also been good and consistent from the outset, so it's good to be on the pace and feeling back at full health and fitness to really ""ride"" the bike. || When I first found out that I was going to win this award, I tried really hard - to care. And then I realized; we are all here tonight, because of a common love: me. || All I've ever wanted was an honest week's pay for an honest day's work. || There is something going on now in Mexico that I happen to think is cruelty to animals. What I'm talking about, of course, is cat juggling. || I am a wild and crazy guy! || You know when you're telling these little stories? Here's a good idea: have a point. It makes it so much more interesting for the listener! || The presence of excessive wealth puts an unnatural spin on the appreciation of art. || Comedy is not pretty. || Yeah, well, we're all writers, aren't we? He's a writer that hasn't been published, and I'm a writer who hasn't written anything. || I believe in equality. Equality for everybody. No matter how stupid they are or how superior I am to them. || Writers block is a fancy term made up by whiners so they can have an excuse to drink alcohol. || When your hobbies get in the way of your work - that's OK; but when your hobbies get in the way of themselves... well... || A kiss may not be the truth, but it is what we wish were true. || You know what your problem is, it's that you haven't seen enough movies - all of life's riddles are answered in the movies. || I believe you should place a woman on a pedestal - high enough so you can look up her dress. || I gave my cat a bath the other day, they love it. He sat there, he enjoyed it, if was fun for me. The fur would stick to my tongue, but other than that. || Love is a promise delivered already broken. || These days it's hard to look at a poodle without thinking what a good meal he would make. || You can’t marry him. You’re a Catholic and he’s… an asshole, think of the children. || Women have choices, and men have responsibilities. || There's someone out there for everyone - even if you need a pickaxe, a compass, and night goggles to find them. || In talking to girls I could never remember the right sequence of things to say. I'd meet a girl and say, ""Hi, was it good for you too?"" If a girl spent the night, I'd wake up in the morning and then try to get her drunk. || I believe Ronald Reagan can make this country what it once was... a large Arctic region covered with ice. || Always... no wait... never... || And I was just thinking: as much as I really admire your shoes, and as much as I'd love to have a pair just like them, I really wouldn't want to be ""in"" your shoes at this particular time and place. || I could never be a woman, 'cause I'd just stay home and play with my breasts all day. || I'm the leader of the platoon and I run gambling and lotteries, dances and I sell beer illegally. I'm a con man and I'm thoroughly lovable. || I'd thought I'd spend time with the kids so they don't turn out weird. || A day without sunshine is like, you know, night. || Talking about music is like dancing about architecture. || Boy, those French: They have a different word for everything! || An apology? Bah! Disgusting! Cowardly! Beneath the dignity of any gentleman, however wrong he might be. || You cannot make your opportunities concur with the opportunities of people whose incomes are ten times greater than yours. || Knowledge of means without knowledge of ends is animal training. || We're going to look at it again in June, we just want to make sure we when we do increase purses we can sustain it, we wouldn't want to have to go back once we increase it. || Wow! You're a genius. You're like the Ernest Hemingway of bullshit. || It was easier to sell a painting that was not for sale. || My first reviews came in. One said, ""This so-called ""comedian"" should be told that jokes are supposed to have punch lines."" Another said I represented ""the most serious booking error in the history of Los Angeles music."" || The environment changed with Martha Stewart and Enron. || It's not tipping I believe in. It's overtipping. || When we started building out here, we knew this was where we were headed. After we built our first one, we realized a lot of our custom homes would have qualified for Built Green. Some of it's the quality of work, some of it's what the market entails for this type of home: It's what the buyers expect. || You're like an energy vampire. You suck the life out of people and take the fun out of being a lawyer. || When someone less capable is ahead of me, I am not pleased. It makes me insane. || Hello, this is Harris. I'm in right now, so you can talk to me personally. Please start talking at the sound of the beep. || You son of a motherless goat! || Ladies and gentlemen, I can envision a day when the brains of brilliant men can be kept alive in the bodies of dumb people! || I hadn't seen a body put together like that since I solved the case of the Murdered Girl with the Big Tits. || Let us just say: I was deeply unhappy, but I didn't know it, because I was so happy all the time. || If you're studying Geology, which is all facts, as soon as you get out of school you forget it all, but Philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your life. || I handed in a script last year and the studio didn't change one word. The word they didn't change was on page 87. || Why is it we don't always recognize the moment when love begins, but we always know when it ends? || I have heard it said that a complicated childhood can lead to a life in the arts. I tell you this story of my father and me to let you know I am qualified to be a comedian. || Were they beautiful? We were all beautiful. We were in our twenties. || Through the years, I have learned there is no harm in charging oneself up with delusions between moments of valid inspiration. || Private companies have a lot of capital. They can run things efficiently and get projects built. || I know we've only known each other 4 weeks and 3 days, but to me it seems like 9 weeks and 5 days. || She was feeling her bohemian oats. || I know we've only known each other 4 weeks and 3 days, but to me it seems like 9 weeks and 5 days. || I believe in eight of the ten commandments; and I believe in going to church every Sunday unless there's a game on. || The only thing that bothers me is if I'm in a restaurant and I'm eating and someone says, ""Hey, mind if I smoke?"" I always say, ""No. Mind if I fart?"" || The new phone book’s here... The new phone book’s here... This is the kind of spontaneous publicity I need... My name in print... That really makes somebody... Things are going to start happening to me now. || Just to be on the front row here is a bit of a prize in itself. || There are few takers for the quiet heart. || I didn’t worry if a bit got no response, as long as I believed it had enough response to linger. || You can’t make something beautiful by trying to make something beautiful. Something becomes beautiful in the process of trying to be something else. || All of those things make it look like a really hard transaction to pull off. But it can be done. || Sure, you can start now. Fire the janitor. || By the way, the proceeds from tonight's telecast - and I think this is so great - will be divvied up between huge corporations. || It doesn't behoove us not to ask these questions. It makes us look like fools. || While my fervent hope is we can get the entire amount. I think we need to have some idea what we would lose. || There are some people that will not pick up a phone and call you, but if you knock on a door and talk to them, they'll talk back to you. || Right now we're teaching them that the game is fun. If they learn it's fun, they always go back to it again in clinics and in schools. || It's kind of a dream come true, because we've always loved these films. We've loved this character, and now we have the opportunity to not remake the movie, but to play these characters. It's like playing Hamlet. || I just think they should get a fair shake. They didn't. They didn't have the rights regular criminals get. || That's a device. I like to think about it as a little bit of a mystery ... the director describes it as a statement of authorship. It's kind of a sophisticated concept, but I like to think of it almost as my character looking back intellectually, but not at an advanced age. || The auction houses seemed not as dull as their financial counterparts on Wall Street, where parents of daughters imagined glass celings and bottom patting. || Lots of women are getting involved. They're not satisfied just being passengers anymore. || She had destroyed whatever was between us by making a profound gaffe: She met me. || These times are much franker. For example, in the first movie we have to assume that the daughter and the son-in-law who got married were lovers before they got married. That could never have been in the '50s. || It eventually appeared to be me, cinematically. When I was writing it I was actually an author, you know, writing a book. ... But there certainly is a difference in energy between a younger man and an older man. || You kill me and I'll see that you never work in this town again. || Mirabelle is not affected by a man’s failures to approach her, as her own self-depreciating attitude never allows the idea that he would in the first place. || People come up to me and say ""Steve, what is film editing?"" And I say ""How should I know? You're the director."" || Mirabelle is attractive; it's just that she is never the first or second girl chosen. || Unlike Ray Porter, his love is fearless and without reservation. || Anyway, seeking work is a tad difficult given the poor design of the streets with their prohibitive curbs and driveways that don't quite line up. || Lacy was just as happy alone as with company. When she was alone, she was potential; with others she was realized. || I believe entertainment can aspire to be art, and can become art, but if you set out to make art you're an idiot. || With a cheery delicacy she divided my obsessions into three categories: acceptable, unacceptable, and hilarious. || I saw the movie, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and I was surprised because I didn't see any tigers or dragons. And then I realised why: they're crouching and hidden. || Hosting the Oscars is much like making love to a woman. It's something I only get to do when Billy Crystal is out of town. || There is one thing I would break up over, and that is if she caught me with another woman. I won't stand for that. || Don't have sex man. It leads to kissing and pretty soon you have to start talking to them. || We've taken what was just once a racetrack and made it a multifaceted gaming destination for the entire region. || It was essential that I never show doubt about what I was doing. || It's pain that changes our lives. || I understood that as much as I had resisted the outside, as much as I had constricted my life, as much as I had closed and narrowed the channels into me, there were still many takers for the quiet heart. || First I get my name in the phone book and now I’m on your ass. You know, I'll bet more people see that than the phone book. || With a cheery delicacy she divided my obsessions into three categories: acceptable, unacceptable, and hilarious. || She tried to get even with him through psychological warfare but couldn't, because he didn't care. || She is nearing forty and not so easily forgiven as when her skin bloomed like roses. || These days it's hard to look at a poodle without thinking what a good meal he would make. || I would assign every lie a color: yellow when they were innocent, pale blue when they sailed over you like the sky, red because I knew they drew blood. And then there was the black lie. That's the worst of all. A black lie was when I told you the truth. || How is it possible to miss a woman whom you kept at a distance, so that when she was gone you would not miss her? || So she viewed time spent in the land of the normal as an investigation into the world of marriage-worthy men, even if she was unsure about her own interest in marriage. There must be one solid citizen who also had a spark of life, a sense of humor and adventure. || I would have felt a little funny if another actor was playing this role. || We are comfortable, collectively, that those 12 [shootings] are related. || I never touched a gun in my life. That and that alone forever doomed me to middle management. || I just brush it off and try to make a joke about it. Over the years it's been interesting. || We are just happy that we are here in Brazil and that this was a good ending. || Lots of women are getting involved. They're not satisfied just being passengers anymore. || Well, excuuuuuse me!!! || I lost 20 pounds - actually, I lost 25 pounds, but then I gained 5 back because I was too skinny. I didn`t change what I ate, I just started eating smaller portions. And I cut out bread - that`s the real killer, because I was reaching in and eating half a loaf before dinner arrived.

I don't have many memories of my dad. The love of cars is all I have of him, really. || All men like to think that they can do it alone, but a real man knows there's no substitute for support, encouragement, or a pit crew. || Be wary of listening to stories secondhand. || I'm sad for adults who want to be children. And children who want to be adults. || My comedy is not mine. It's a gift. I'm not that smart. || One of the best pieces of advice my mother gave me was ""Make your bed in other people's homes. That way you get invited back."" || In marriage, compromise nurtures the relationship. || Men are pigs. Too bad we own everything. || The world's a mean place. It's unfair, then it's fair. It's hateful, then it's loving. It's a very peculiar place on philosophical and metaphysical and religious levels. || I am a thespian trapped in a man’s body. || I think women like Ferraris. A Ferrari is everybody's car. || Nothing's as easy as it is on a sitcom. Issues that we take care of in 20 minutes on the show can stretch out over years in real families. || When somebody tells you they're not very smart, they're saying exactly the opposite. || In my experience, it's all wonderful with girls until about 16. Around that time, boys kind of calm down and start focusing their testosterone. Girls get a little challenging, especially for fathers. || The greatest missile in the world is useless... unless it's targeted. A torpedo is adrift unless it has someplace to go. An arrow is pointless unless it hits something. So it's important for kids - for everyone, even if you fail at first - to target something and head in that direction. With all your might. || The unfairness of life is indicative of trees. I planted twenty trees on the same block. It's so fucking weird. Six became huge. One is giant. And there are some little shitty ones. Same soil. Same water. Same seed. But those little ones just don't grow. I can't explain it. || Speeding is like drugs. It makes everything come at you fast, and when you go back to normal driving, safe driving, prudent driving, it seems boring. That's the danger of drugs. At first it's intoxicating, but then the rest of your life you're trying to find that very first time. It never is the same. || When I went to jail, reality hit so hard that it took my breath away, took my stance away, took my strength away. I was there buck naked, humiliated, sitting in my own crap and urine - this is a metaphor. My ego had run off. Your ego is the biggest coward. || Playing golf is like going to a strip joint. After 18 holes you’re tired and most of your balls are missing. || But separate a man from his car - that's inhuman. || To get a man's attention, just stand in front of the TV and don't move. He'll talk to you. I promise. || Sometimes you get the sense that the Creator is getting to that point of ""Yeah, we might have to reboot."" || I was gone so much in my first marriage. I love the moments when I engage with my youngest daughter now. It's not my thing to sit on the ground and play tea party, but I'll do it because it's a moment that will stick with me forever. || Use a screwdriver instead of a hammer. Try to untighten the nut with your hand. Utilize the path of least resistance first. || I blend memories. I blend them into one that's funny. I exaggerate to clarify. || Electricity can be dangerous. My nephew tried to stick a penny into a plug. Whoever said a penny doesn't go far didn't see him shoot across that floor. I told him he was grounded. || My stepfather stepped in where no man would've stepped in - six kids, five of them boys - and that's heroic. || If you want to condemn yourself for the mistakes you've made, let's be fair, that means you've got to congratulate yourself for all the good things you've done. It's okay to say, ""God, I wish I’d done this; yeah, but I did do that."" Then it kind of balances out. || Dad needs to show an incredible amount of respect and humor and friendship toward his mate so the kids understand their parents are sexy, they're fun, they do things together, they're best friends. Kids learn by example. If I respect Mom, they're going to respect Mom. || Women are like cars: we all want a Ferrari, sometimes want a pickup truck, and end up with a station wagon. || Men are liars. We'll lie about lying if we have to. I'm an algebra liar. I figure two good lies make a positive. || I have to get a licence to drive a motorcycle to protect myself and the people around me. I am adamant there should be some sort of licensing required to have children. || I love doing logos. I've been a graphic artist all my life. || In the last three years of racing I've met as many women fans as men fans, and in NASCAR it's the same thing. My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn't have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best. || The big advantage to playing the Venetian in Las Vegas - where it's a beautiful theater - is that unlike other places, even many other nice venues, I can do a set and lighting cues, I can put on a real show. I can dress up, wear a tux. || Never comment on a woman's rear end. Never use the words ""large"" or ""size"" with ""rear end."" Never. Avoid the area altogether. Trust me. || Being wealthy when no one else is is like being the only one at the party with a drink. || You don't know what people are really like until they're under a lot of stress. || While awaiting sentencing, I decided to give stand-up comedy a shot. The judge had suggested I get my act together, and I took him seriously."
Wanda Sykes,"For guys, sex is like going to a restaurant, and no matter what you order off that menu, you walk out of there going, 'Damn, that was good!' || When you get married, you stand there and you say 'Til death do you part.' That's what you say in the marriage vows - make that vow, stay together forever. The divorce rate is sky high, so everybody's just lying their asses off. Why don't we come clean? Let's be honest, you know? Instead of standing there saying 'Til death do you part,' let's just go, 'I'll give it a shot.' || Actually, I majored in marketing and I have a bachelor of science. || I'm not politically correct. I still say 'black,' I do. Because 'African American' - there's no bonus; it's not going to make your life any easier. You don't see black people standing around going, 'Woo yeah, African American. Man, I tell you, this beats the hell out of being black. We should have made the switch years ago.' || We spend $48 million in lottery tickets. You can’t trust us with out money. ""How you planning for your retirement?"" ""Powerball."" || Back then, I was doing more of my impression of what a comic is supposed to do. || It seems like when I first started, people got into comedy because they wanted to be good comedians. || I did a benefit for a feminist organization. Now benefit means 'no money,' so I should be able to say what I want to say. And I figured if I pissed them off, who cares? What, they're going to get mad and pay me? So it's all feminists - Gloria Steinem's sitting right up front. So, I walk out there, and I'm like, 'Hey look, I can't stay here too long with you broads because I got to get home and cook my man a nice hot dinner.' || I hate when women compare men to dogs. Men are not dogs. Dogs are loyal. I’ve never found any strange panties in my dog’s house. || I work hard. The staff and crew see how much energy I put into this project, and it makes them step up. || One night, we watchin' some porno, I just thought I'd joke around a little bit. So, I was like, 'Wow! Will you look at that? I have never seen a penis that big before in my life. Woo! He is huge. Hey, are they supposed to be that big?' And he was like, 'Uh, uh - don't pay that any mind. They just do that with lights and stuff, that's all.' I was like, 'Well, shoot, we need to get some lights up in here.' || The president is on national TV apologizing for getting oral sex. Why didn't he just stick with his lie? You got to stick with your lie. If you lie, you have to believe that lie whole-heartedly. It has to become the truth for you. But this man, the most powerful man in the world, is on national TV apologizing for receiving oral sex. He's an idiot. There are men sitting in here right now who would gladly accept oral sex on national TV. || Some government workers are dedicated and work hard, but most of them are just waiting to retire. || I have a funny family, but none of them are remotely in show business. || To me, political office should be like jury duty. You should just get a notice in mail one day and be like, ""I’m Secretary of State next month!"" || It's hard to get fired from the government. You have to, like, kill people. || I don't understand this whole Elvis thing. There are dead people in my family that we miss and love dearly, but shoot, we don't dress up like them and do impressions. I'll show up at the family reunion in a dirty t-shirt and a bald cap - 'Look, everybody, I'm Uncle Earl.' || That's what they want: two women. Fellas, I think that's a bit lofty. Because, come on, think about it - if you can't satisfy that one woman, why do you want to piss off another one? Why have two angry women in the bed with you at the same time? And think about it - you know how much you hate to talk after sex, imagine having two women just nagging you to death. || But I think funny and talent will always win out; I mean, of course there are hurdles, but I think if you're funny you will get over all of that. || I'm here today because I refused to be unhappy. I took a chance. || Lot Of Strip Clubs in Florida... Good grief... Florida has so many strip clubs, they need to change their state flag to a brass pole. || They never want to hang out with us. You're like, 'Come on y'all, let's go hang out.' They're like, 'No, you know, we can't hang out. You know, we're going to stay here with the kids tonight. Yeah, you know, they're a lot of work, but they're worth it. Maybe next week we can go hang out or something - What? Oh, you're going on vacation next week. Well isn't that nice? That's just nice. Where you going, where you going? Jamaica! Wooo! Yeah, that's beautiful. Yeah, you know, we started to go last year, but Bobby needed braces. Yeah - Bobby, smile and show them Jamaica, baby, go ahead - see? We're right on the beach.' || Every now and then, I like to give out some advice. Ladies - don't laugh during the porno watching. || Comedy Central, they told me I had to watch my language because, the woman said, they had 'standards and practices.' I was like, wait a minute - you're Comedy Central. Aren't you the network where your number one show is a cartoon with a talking piece of shit? || People say, 'Well don't you regret not having kids?' And I go, 'No, not really.' And then if they keep asking, I always say this, 'Well, you know, maybe I'll adopt.' But I don't mean that. It's just something I say to make me sound like a nicer person. || Diamonds are forever, but touching our clit can buy you two or three years. || Bush and Cheney have this whole thing where if you talk about America, if you talk about them, then you're anti-American. || I guess because of my act, people think that I say things they want to say, and that they can just come up and say anything to me. || I love my family but my family - they're the type of people that never let you forget anything you ever did when you were little. I was in the first grade Christmas play - I'm playing Mary. Now, during the course of the play, I dropped the baby Jesus. They act like I dropped the baby Jesus. So now, they still talk about this. I go to my family reunion, and one of my cousins just had a baby. So I'm like, 'Oh, that's a cute little baby. Let me hold the baby. Let me see the baby.' And my aunt runs over, 'Don't you give her that baby! You know she dropped the baby Jesus!' || There's nothing wrong with dating younger men. My husband and I, we get along except for music because music dates you. He loves hip-hop - that's his thing, he loves rap music - but I like jazz. But he's started to enjoy jazz because I like to listen to jazz while we're having sex. Yeah, right, so now he loves jazz because he associates it with sex. He hears that jazz, he's like, 'That's my cue! It's on now!' But now, I can't even enjoy my music. I'm listening to Miles Davis, washing dishes. I turn around, he's standing there butt naked: 'Did ya call me?' || I have nephews. They love spending time with us. T they love it because we let them do whatever they want to do - they're not our kids, we don't care. 'Only thing I have to do is keep you alive, that's it.' They come visit us, man - 'Oh what? Oh, no dinner? Alright, fine, hey - ice cream all day, how about that? I don't have to cook a damn thing. Just scoop it out. There you go. Eat up. I don't pay your dental bills.' || In '87, I used to do this awful, awful James Brown impression. || My neighbor, she invited me to an Elvis party. I told her I couldn't come 'cause I'd be too busy making fun of her from behind my blinds. || Guys don't buy you free drinks like they used to. They don't. Remember the good old days? You'd go to your local bar, and the bartender would come over and say, 'Excuse me, ma'am, the gentleman way over there in the corner, he would like to buy you a drink.' You would say, 'OK, thank you. Beautiful.' And you would get your drink, and then the greatest thing of all - he would keep his ass way over there in the corner and leave you the hell alone. || That's proof right there that men and women are on different levels because men can watch two women together and that's a turn-on. It doesn't work the same way for us, does it, ladies? No, uh-uh - it doesn't work the same. You ask any woman in here her sexual fantasy, and I will bet you a million dollars that it's NOT to go home and catch your man bent over with some big, burly guy standing behind him. || My girlfriend called me because one of our other friends is getting married. So, they told me I had to pitch in for a male stripper. I said, 'You out your damn mind. I ain't payin' for no naked-ass man.' I mean, you think about it - women? We really don't have to pay to see that. I mean, really - we spend most of our time trying not to see that. || Once you start making money, you can be an ass. But I am not an ass. I'm too lazy, that takes a lot of energy. || With a black president, I can relax... I can dance in public... I can buy a whole watermelon now. || I feel today's society is so judgmental. || Don't bother me while I'm eating, or when I'm coming out of the crackhouse or something. Just let me get going. || If you feel like there's something out there that you're supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. || They mess with your food, they do. They go 'Well Wanda, first we're gonna cut out all your carbs...' OK, wait a minute, hold up. Let me explain something to you. I've got this medical condition, and when you cut out my carbs - my foot? Right up your ass. || Whenever we go out, I pay all the tolls. Yeah - he backs up to the tolls so the booth would be on my side. || I don't go out with my single friends - not at all - because I never have a good time, never have fun. We go to a club, a guy comes over - 'Hey, can I buy you a drink?' They're like, 'No, she's married.' I'm like, 'Yeah, I'm married, but I'm thirsty. Why don't you shut the hell up, and let me have a free drink?' || You know when a relationship goes bad, man. You can tell when it goes bad when the sexual fantasies start getting all dark and everything. I was in this relationship, and he was like, 'Come on, come on - what's your fantasy?' And I was like, 'Well, I woke up, and you were dead.' || Our air quality's all messed up now. Knew that was coming when they lowered the emissions standards. Knew that was gonna happen when he appointed Christine Whitman head of the EPA. Yeah, the governor of New Jersey is head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Do you know how dirty New Jersey is? || Some black people want to get in touch with their African roots. But then you got some black people that just don't give a damn. You tell them, 'Hey, I just got back from the motherland.' They're like, 'Where'd you go - Detroit? Did you see The Temptations?' || When my parents send me emails the first 3 are blank. || We have to get out there and touch the people and let them know that you are thinking about them and to try and lift their spirits and get awareness out there to the rest of the country. || When we ask you if we look fat, it really means ""Can you see my clit?"" || I sat down and wrote some jokes and went to the talent show, got up on stage, fell in love with it and never turned back. || Then you had people who wanted to get into comedy just to get a TV deal. || I love doing stand-up, because it gives me the freedom to say what I really want to say. I think that's why it's my favorite thing to do. || You know the economy is bad when illegals start complaining that Americans are taking their jobs. || I know every time I fly, I get checked twice: they stop me at security, and then, they get me again at the gate. And last time, it was so bad, they actually made me go through the machine with the luggage. || I knew something was wrong with the economy when the shampoo girl at my salon closed on a six bedroom house. || The man has a 70% approval rate, which makes sense to me because he's pretty much done everything I expected him to do: the economy's in the toilet, we're at war and everything's on fire. || I noticed recently, in the last few shows I did, that I'm starting to get people - not a large group, but quite a few people - who come to see me because they love Curb Your Enthusiasm. || What drives the creative person is that we see it all. || Usually, there's nothing being thrown toward the stage or at me. Then I feel pretty good about it. || Men don't hear women. || If you're passionate about your work, it makes the people around you want to be involved too. || I'm really funny now. || I think it's because my comedy is in your face, and it comes from a place that's real. || I love Costas. He's knows too much, but he's a good guy. || I like doing a bunch of different things, being all over the place. || I always want to go back and do stand-up; I like the freedom. || But sometimes the women writers will pitch something and I'll hear it, but the men will keep talking. || And then also I think it's harder for women because comedy is so opposite of being ladylike. || If something stinks, I say it stinks. But I try to massage it a little and not be as cutting, come behind it with a joke: Hey, I cut you deep, but now let me put a couple of stitches in you. || A woman would pitch a joke. Nothing. Then a guy would pitch it and everybody would laugh. || It's easier to rip somebody to shreds while you're making them laugh. || I'm here today because I hated everything else. || Seriously, I don't need a gun. I'm easily annoyed. I would shoot people in my house that I invited over. || He used to give me one rose, too. Watch out for the one rose givers. He used to say, 'This is one rose for you because you are one special lady.' Yeah, I fell for that mess. After a while, I was like, 'No, no, no, no - this is one rose because you are one cheap bastard - that's what this is.' || I can hear my mother now: 'What? Oh, you gonna get a divorce? It's just that easy, huh? Things get hard, things get rough - you just want to throw in the towel, just like that. Let me tell you something, that's a bunch of bull. Let me tell you something - your father and I had a shoot out, OK? He took one in the arm - Harry, show her where I shot you - now, see that's love right there. You gotta learn how to work these things out. He was wrong, I shot him - you move on.' || As soon as he turned pro and he won his first tournament, I read, 'Bi-racial golfer wins first tournament.' Oh, OK - 50/50: he's 50% black, 50% Asian. Alright, cool. Then after he won the masters, I'm flipping through Sports Illustrated, and I read, 'Tiger Woods is a quarter black,' and I'm like, 'Damn, he's down to 25% now, man. What the hell is going on? They're treating him like he's milk.' || I was really gifted at being able to construct a joke, but it's like they weren't even memorable, my first jokes, because they were so about nothing. || But I understand that relationship; I understand how the mother-in-law, daughter-in-law relationship has so many conflicts because it's so forced. || It wasn't until I became more confident with myself and I put myself forward instead of the jokes; at first it was put the jokes out there and I'm just behind the jokes. || Yeah, I had top-secret clearance and everything. || When life gives you lemons don't make lemonade, make pink lemonade. Be unique. || All these teenagers tell us how much they want to grow up and then when they do they want to be young again. || That word sassy - it haunts me. I keep getting the sassy thing. || I don't like the saying keep your friends close and enemies closer. I want my enemy on a different planet. || Mostly everything gets worse before it gets better. || When I am outside at night by myself every person turns into a pedophile. So I tend to walk a little faster than usual and then I sprint. || ""Go have boys' night out"" really means ""I'll stay home and touch my clit."" || The quickest way to a woman's heart is through her clit. || L.A. is nothing but a bunch of driving, and I hate all that damn driving 'cause it interferes with my drinking. || He’s going around putting little covers over the electrical outlets and all that stuff, and I’m like, ‘How the kids going to learn about electricity, huh?’ || The fact that women make seventy-five cents to every man's dollar won't bother us as long as you touch our clit. || I was hanging out with my little nephew, and the kid - he had a helmet, shoulder pads, knee pads, some shin guards, gloves. Talk about, 'I'm a go ride my bike.' I'm like, 'Where - through a mine field?' || They pulled out that dress, man - they scared him, they scared him. That little dress with the DNA - he lost it; he gave up the lie. But my thing is, who's going to believe a woman who keeps a nasty dress? They ought to toss that right out of court: 'Excuse me, your honor, she kept the dress.' 'What? Case dismissed - and get your nasty ass out of my court room. I should throw you in jail just for being nasty, Miss Nasty Ass.' || When we say we want you to get in touch with your feminine side, we really mean you need to touch our clit. || Now, I think the people who are still doing stand-up are doing it because they love stand-up. || I’m a black, gay woman. I think the only way to make the GOP hate me more is if I sent them a video of me rolling around on a pile of welfare checks. || I'm gonna tell you right now - somebody walked in here and told me I just won the lottery, I will walk out in the middle of this joke."
Woody Allen,"I had a mad impulse to throw you down on the lunar surface and commit interstellar perversion. || For God sakes, this is a woman I was married to for 10 years. We made love. I'd hold her head over the toilet bowl when she threw up.  || Life is for the living. || I think people should mate for life, like pigeons or Catholics. || There are worse things in life than death. Have you ever spent an evening with an insurance salesman? || It`s true I had a lot of anxiety. I was afraid of the dark and suspicious of the light. || The study of economy usually shows us that the best time for purchase was last year. || My relationship with American audiences is the exact same as it always has been. They never came to see my films, and they don't come now. || After 60, all of us belong to the weaker sex. || When a doctor makes a mistake, it's best to bury the subject. || Now is the time to strike. The Leader is at great handicap, he has no head or body! || To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering, one must not love. But then, one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer; not to love is to suffer; to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love. To be happy, then, is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy. Therefore, to be happy, one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness. || I spend a lot of time idly. I go to sporting events, play my clarinet. I practise. But if you work every day, a certain amount on a steady basis, the work accumulates. || I'd never join a club that would allow a person like me to become a member. || It shows exactly what you can do if you're a total psychotic. || They called me mad... But it was I - yes I - who discovered the link between excessive masturbation and entry into politics! || I am an only child. I have one sister. || Don't worry, I know almost exactly what I'm doing. || We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. || Eternal nothingness is fine if you happen to be dressed for it. || What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists? In that case, I definitely overpaid for my carpet. || I knew I was in love. First of all, I was very nauseous. || There's more to life than sitting around in the sun in your underwear playing the clarinet. || I have no regard for that kind of ceremony. I just don't think they know what they're doing. When you see who wins those things - or who doesn't win them - you can see how meaningless this Oscar thing is. || When a man is driving in a car and looks out the window and notices a woman with a great body, as he strains to check her face out, how does she know to keep turning so the back of her head is always toward him? || Is world peace possible or is the human race too innately aggressive? For instance: Have you ever seen women at a sample sale? || I was raised in the Jewish tradition, taught never to marry a Gentile woman, shave on a Saturday night and, most especially, never to shave a Gentile woman on a Saturday night. || It's something that occurs to me many times in my movies. They can often be treated comically or dramatically, and I usually opt to treat them comically. But it occurred to me that you could get a story and you could fool around with it both ways. || All the crap they tell you about... getting joy and having a kind of wisdom in your golden years - it's all tripe. || I idolized Superman when I was younger. I thought he and I had a lot in common. He was always going into phonebooths and taking off all his clothes. || In perpetrating a revolution, there are two requirements: someone or something to revolt against and someone to actually show up and do the revolting. Dress is usually casual and both parties may be flexible about time and place, but if either faction fails to attend, the whole enterprise is likely to come off badly. || It's a match made in heaven... by a retarded angel. || What do I dislike about death? Must be the hours. || Someone once asked me if my dream was to live on in the hearts of my people, and I said I would like to live on in my apartment. || I asked the girl if she could bring a sister for me. She did. Sister Maria Teresa. It was a very slow evening. We discussed the New Testament. We agreed that He was very well adjusted for an only child. || It's very hard to keep your spirits up. You've got to keep selling yourself a bill of goods, and some people are better at lying to themselves than others. If you face reality too much, it kills you.... you've got to find an answer to the question: Why go on? || I took a puff of the wrong cigarette at a fraternity dance once, and the cops had to get me, y'know. I broke two teeth trying to give a hickie to the Statue of Liberty. || The wicked at heart probably know something. || Honey! Bring down a copy of my will - and an eraser! || I'm short enough and ugly enough to succeed on my own. || Tradition is the illusion of permanance. || Right now it's only a notion, but I think I can get the money to make it into a concept, and later turn it into an idea. || It is impossible to experience one's death objectively and still carry a tune. || I'm astounded by people who want to ""know"" the universe when it's hard enough to find your way around Chinatown. || I think being funny is not anyone's first choice. || Nietzsche says that we will live the same life, over and over again. God - I'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again. || I was walking through the woods, thinking about Christ. If He was a carpenter, I wondered what He charged for bookshelves. || I took a speed-reading course and read War and Peace in twenty minutes. It involves Russia. || I don't believe in the after life, although I am bringing a change of underwear. || I am not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens. || I am thankful for laughter, except when milk comes out of my nose. || I was nauseous and tingly all over. I was either in love or I had smallpox. || I will not eat oysters. I want my food dead. Not sick. Not wounded. Dead. || I'm such a good lover because I practice a lot on my own. || Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons. || On the plus side, death is one of the few things that can be done as easily lying down. || When I was kidnapped, my parents snapped into action. They rented out my room. || My education was dismal. I went to a series of schools for mentally disturbed teachers. || Years ago I wrote this short story about my mother called ""The Castrating Zionist"". || I hate reality but it's still the best place to get a good steak. || I have no idea what I am doing but incompetence has never prevented me from plunging in with enthusiasm. || I don't have to ""freedom-kiss"" my wife when what I really want to do is French-kiss her. || We are the sum total of our choices... || This year I'm a star, but what will I be next year? A black hole? || Raised by two mothers... wow, most of us barely survive one. || My movies are more popular in France than back at home. The subtitles must be great. || I don’t want to move to a city where the only cultural advantage is being able to make a right turn on a red light. || Can you believe that? She says I’m not leader enough for her. Who was she looking for... Hitler? || The universe is merely a fleeting idea in God's mind - a pretty uncomfortable thought, particularly if you've just made a down payment on a house. || When the Academy called, I panicked. I thought they might want their Oscars back and the pawn shop has been out of business for a while. || This is so antiseptic. It`s empty. Why do you think this is funny?
